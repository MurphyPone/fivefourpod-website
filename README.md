## Notes from chatting with the pod

On the brink of being ready to publish the site. 

Everyone loves the site, pressuring Leon how to get a merch store set up for them.  In his naivete, he built a website for the merchstore.

change the /store route to point to the wix site.  

1. Keep fivefourpod.com it will reroute to the wix page for the shop.  Can pay for the hosting fees.  And compensate me for hours.

2. Have Leon get me the Wix login to poke around to see If I can't get it done.

3. Another thing they'd like to do is a TeeSpring - see if we can't get it embedded nicely.
