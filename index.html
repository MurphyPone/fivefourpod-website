                        <p>0:00:00.0 Speaker 1: We'll hear argument now, No. 00-1595, Hoffman Plastic Compounds Inc versus the National Labor Relations Board.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:00:11.8 Leon: Hey everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Hoffman Plastics v NLRB, a 2002 case, which a worker was fired from his job at a manufacturing plant after campaigning for a union. When the case came before the NLRB, they determined that Hoffman Plastics had violated labor law by firing the worker, but during the hearing, it was revealed that he did not have authorization to work in the United States, which Hoffman Plastics then used to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The Liberal justices argued that if the court ruled in favor of Hoffman Plastics, other employers could take advantage of it to abuse undocumented workers. In the end, the Court did rule in Hoffman's favor, holding that undocumented workers cannot recover lost wages under to the law. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:01:08.2 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have rendered our liberties completely immobile like a cargo ship turned sideways in the Suez Canal.</p>
                        <p>0:01:17.2 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:01:22.0 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:01:23.2 Peter: I am Peter, I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:25.7 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:26.7 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:27.6 Rhiannon: What's up everybody? Hello.</p>
                        <p>0:01:29.2 Peter: Today's case is Hoffman Plastics v National Labor Relations Board. This case is about one of the many ways in which our laws fail to protect undocumented people in this country from being systematically and systemically abused by this country's oligarchic institutions. In this case, a company was unknowingly employing an undocumented worker, Jose Castro. Company fired him for participating in union activities, and it's illegal to do that, by the way, you can't fire people for participating in union activities. So Castro sues under the National Labor Relations Act, and he wins and is awarded back pay, which is the legal term for wages he would have earned if he hadn't been fired, but the court, in a 5-4 decision written by Mr. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, says that he can't be paid his lost wages because he was not legally working in the first place. This case is important because it is the intersection of anti-immigrant and anti-labor sentiment, two cornerstones of the conservative agenda. We get to see them just crash together like two enormous waves in the middle of an ocean, and it's depressing, it's dark.</p>
                        <p>0:02:54.4 Michael: I just wanted to give you guys a heads up on how my brain is operating today.</p>
                        <p>0:02:58.9 Rhiannon: Please.</p>
                        <p>0:03:00.6 Michael: I know this guy's name is Jose Castro, 'cause I've read the case and done preparation for this episode, but when Peter said, An undocumented worker and said his name, what I heard is, Who's a Castro? And I was like, "Is that a weird way to refer to Cubans"? As a Cuban should I be offended? And it's like, "What the fuck is up with Peter?" And It took me a minute.</p>
                        <p>0:03:25.4 Peter: This fucking Castro Che Guevara over here.</p>
                        <p>0:03:28.0 Michael: This fucking Castro. [chuckle] So get excited for this episode guys.</p>
                        <p>0:03:35.7 Rhiannon: Thanks for joining us Michael. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:03:39.6 Peter: Alright. So Rhi, you want to walk us through some of the background here, let's do it.</p>
                        <p>0:03:45.9 Rhiannon: Sure. Yeah. Quick note on some terminology, vocabulary used, I think we'll be using the word undocumented interchangeably with describing people as working without authorization, just a heads up that we'll be saying those things throughout the episode, but they mean something a little bit different. If you're undocumented, then it's said that you are here without any papers that establish your legal presence in the United States, if you just don't have work authorization, that's different, you might be here on some sort of legal status, like on a visa, but you don't have authorization to work legally. So as we shift into the facts of this case, Hoffman Plastics, I think a little brain exercise might be useful. So, put yourself in the place of a supervisor or the owner of a manufacturing business, say for example, you own a poultry factory, lucky you, that sounds great. Now, if you're imagining this scenario realistically as it would actually play out today, you as the owner of this poultry factory, know for a fact already that many of your employees do not have work authorization in the United States. That's just the reality, right? Many of your employees are undocumented or do not have actual legitimate work authorization.</p>
                        <p>0:05:07.4 Rhiannon: Now, you hear a rumor one day that a small group of your employees is talking about unionizing. Now you're a big boss, big bosses don't like that, that's gonna be expensive for you. You're gonna have to pay for more healthcare and maybe beef up your workers compensation schemes, and you're probably gonna have to increase wages if your employees unionize, that's no good for you. You know what would be cheaper though? You could fire one of these employees...</p>
                        <p>0:05:36.1 Michael: Make an example of them.</p>
                        <p>0:05:37.2 Rhiannon: That's right. You know that they might get deported. Everyone else in your business, all the other employees watch that happen and are understandably terrified because they would also face deportation, and so everyone kinda settles down, so to speak on the unionization efforts. And that is very near the situation that happens to Jose Castro in this case. In the late '80s, Jose Castro works for Hoffman Plastics compounds in California. This is a plastics making factory.</p>
                        <p>0:06:12.1 Michael: It's like a chemical plant, isn't it?</p>
                        <p>0:06:13.7 Rhiannon: No, they manufacture plastics.</p>
                        <p>0:06:16.4 Michael: Do they?</p>
                        <p>0:06:16.7 Peter: Maybe we should stick with chicken.</p>
                        <p>0:06:17.9 Rhiannon: They manufacture polyvinyl resins and plastic pipework. I'm looking at it bros. Okay. [laughter] Alright. Now, at the time that he's hired Jose Castro does not have authorization to work legally in the United States, but he presents, at the time that he's hired, an authentic US Birth Certificate, but it's for somebody else. Several months after Castro was hired, the United Rubber Cork, Linoleum, and Plastic Workers of America, started an organizing campaign at Hoffman Plastics. Now, Castro hears about the organizing campaign and he decides to join up, and he supports the unionization efforts at Hoffman Plastics by doing stuff like handing out flyers to other employees, talking about the benefits of unionizing, that kind of thing. Now, when Hoffman Plastics finds out that Castro is participating in unionization efforts, they fire him along with several other pro-union employees. Now that is... If you know anything about Labor Law, that is retaliation, it was in direct retaliation for the unionization efforts, and so Castro takes his case to the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, and the NLRB for their part agrees with Castro and says that he was fired for participating in pro-union activities in unionization efforts at Hoffman Plastics, and they award Jose Castro two remedies.</p>
                        <p>0:07:51.1 Rhiannon: First, if he gets damages, he's awarded back pay, like Peter said, which is the wages he would have earned if he had not been unlawfully fired from Hoffman Plastics and had maintained his job there. And the second is the NLRB also ordered that Hoffman Plastics reinstate Mr. Castro's employment there. Now, a little bit later on down the line, as the administrative law process moves on, Castro actually divulged in an administrative law hearing that he did not have authorization to work legally in the United States. So it's at that point that Hoffman Plastics found out that Mr. Castro had been technically working illegally in the US, and that's when they jump on this opportunity and begin to appeal the order to award Mr. Castro back pay. This is what gets appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court. They were saying that they should not have to pay back pay to Mr. Castro because he is undocumented and was working illegally to begin with.</p>
                        <p>0:08:54.0 Peter: So let's talk a little bit about the law here. The National Labor Relations Act is a law passed in the 1930s that protects workers with a focus on protecting unions and union organizing. And under that law, you can't fire or otherwise interfere with the workers who are engaged in union organizing. So the court's opinion here is at its heart, very simple, Castro was saying he was illegally fired and he should be paid the wages that he would have earned if he hadn't been. That's how damages work in employment cases.</p>
                        <p>0:09:28.0 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:09:28.8 Peter: But William Rehnquist, he essentially admits that Castro was illegally fired, but says, "Look, because he was not legally employed, he can't recoup his lost wages." And that's really the whole majority argument here. Now, I think some people might find some intuitive appeal in this argument. Not legally employed can't recover wages. So before we go on, I think it's important to understand that this rule is completely made up by the court.</p>
                        <p>0:09:56.6 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:09:57.4 Peter: The statute in question does not say anything about this. Our Immigration Laws do not say anything about not recovering back wages under Employment Laws. Contracts are not just null and void because they're made with an undocumented person. All of the relevant Federal Agencies, including the immigration-focused agencies have said that this man should be allowed to recover the money. The court is literally just making this up out of thin air. They do cite to a similar case from a few years prior that has a somewhat analogous situation, but the rule in that case was made up too, as some would say.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:10:31.9 Peter: Doesn't really get you anywhere, in my view. And maybe to paint a clear picture here, there's no question, even among the court's conservatives, that the law protects undocumented people. You can't just assault an undocumented person and not get charged 'cause they're not here legally.</p>
                        <p>0:10:48.1 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:10:49.1 Peter: And maybe more to the point, you can't steal from an undocumented person and just get to keep what you steal, so why is an employer allowed to do exactly that?</p>
                        <p>0:11:00.3 Rhiannon: That's right. Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:11:00.5 Peter: I mean, that's really all this is. This is the court on its own deciding that employers can plainly violate the law if the victim is an undocumented person.</p>
                        <p>0:11:10.7 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:11:11.3 Peter: That's it.</p>
                        <p>0:11:11.7 Rhiannon: Right. Yep.</p>
                        <p>0:11:12.2 Peter: Now, you might think that this is sort of unfair because the undocumented person in this case is getting punished, but the employer is sort of getting off the hook. But Rehnquist says, "No, actually. The employer is experiencing, "significant" sanctions for its conduct."</p>
                        <p>0:11:29.2 Rhiannon: Significant.</p>
                        <p>0:11:31.7 Peter: So you might wanna know, dear listener, what are those sanctions?</p>
                        <p>0:11:37.9 Michael: I lost my shit when I read this paragraph.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:11:41.0 Peter: There are two. The first is a cease and desist telling them not to violate the National Labor Relations Act in the future.</p>
                        <p>0:11:49.5 Rhiannon: Okay.</p>
                        <p>0:11:50.1 Michael: That means they received a letter. A sternly-worded letter.</p>
                        <p>0:11:53.6 Peter: A letter that says, "Don't do it."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:11:56.8 Peter: The second is that they have to post a notice for employees explaining their NLRA rights.</p>
                        <p>0:12:03.4 Michael: They have to write a letter.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:12:06.1 Peter: I am not exaggerating this. These are the two penalties...</p>
                        <p>0:12:09.2 Michael: That's it.</p>
                        <p>0:12:10.2 Peter: For violating the National Labor Relations Act. A letter that told them to stop violating it and a notice that would be posted in a break room explaining their rights. And the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, described those as significant sanctions. A cease and desist among lawyers is almost an in-joke for how little it means. It's almost always a bluff, It's something you send because there is no real consequence that you can enforce, and so you just send a letter being like, "Stop doing it." If the penalty for violating a law is a letter that says, "Stop violating the law," it just feels...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:12:51.9 Peter: It feels like that's not a real penalty at all.</p>
                        <p>0:12:54.6 Rhiannon: I have questions about the accountability. Right. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:12:57.3 Michael: Look. Back in the day, when teachers could like wrap your wrist with a ruler or whatever, that's a more significant penalty.</p>
                        <p>0:13:03.5 Peter: And that slap on the wrist is literally the colloquial term for a punishment that doesn't match.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:13:09.6 Michael: That's exactly right. That's... That's where it's going. And the other thing is the incentives here are wild because like Rhiannon was saying earlier on, you sort of know if you work in certain industries or work at certain areas that some of your employees are undocumented, but this sends a clear signal that you can treat undocumented workers poorly, which encourages employers to turn a blind eye and maybe even purposefully hire more undocumented workers. Because this is a workforce, as long as they provide some bullshit form of ID, some sort of worker authorization, even if you know it's false, that's all the better, because that means you know you have this hanging over them at any time and you don't have to follow labor regulations, you don't have to follow OSHA. You don't even have to necessarily pay them minimum wage, which is what has happened in this country as a result of this decision.</p>
                        <p>0:14:09.1 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:14:09.7 Michael: So the incentives here is to hire more undocumented workers and to treat them worse.</p>
                        <p>0:14:15.6 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:14:16.1 Michael: That's what this decision encourages.</p>
                        <p>0:14:18.1 Rhiannon: My example up top about, if you are the boss of a place like this and you can simply just fire somebody rather than listen to the demands of a unionized and organized workforce, you're allowed to do that because of cases like this, because there is no accountability in labor law, in employment law other than these sort of remedies. Other than the employers themselves being forced and ordered to pay people back wages, to reinstate people's jobs when they've been unlawfully retaliated against by their supervisors. So, yeah, that example up top is absolutely the reality, and it's only so because of... Because the accountability mechanisms in our law aren't even enforced by the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:15:08.9 Michael: I don't think this is like some particularly amazing insight, but it's worth noting the NLRA is in a big important law, that had a purpose and this is like kneecapping it, this is like totally subverting the purpose of these laws by making it easier for employers to treat their employees like shit. By selecting a group of employees who they know are without legal revenue.</p>
                        <p>0:15:37.5 Peter: And maybe we should touch a little bit on the history of the NLRA, the National Labor Relations Act, 'cause I think it's important here for that reason. It was passed in 1935 and came on the tail end of a period that saw probably the most sustained exploitation of workers in American history. From about 1900 through the early to mid-30s. During that time, the Supreme Court had effectively enshrined worker exploitation into the constitution in what was called the Lochner Era, when it allowed employers to require just about anything of their employees by contract. That included long work days, brutal working conditions, a little bit of child labor here and there.</p>
                        <p>0:16:16.5 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:16:17.3 Peter: And it also included the notorious yellow-dog contract in which an employee would sign away their right to unionize. Great depression happens, worker agitation for their rights picks up. The Norris-LaGuardia Act is passed in 1932, it's sort of a precursor to the NLRA. The NLRA gets passed a few years later in 1935, and provides this sort of sweeping protection for workers to organize and forbids employers from interfering with that right. Conservatives have long been concerned with the potential scope of the NLRA. And so they've taken strides to weaken it at every return if they can. This isn't the first time we've talked about the NLRA, if you remember in Epic Systems v. Lewis, which we did six years ago, I think.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:17:03.2 Peter: The Court essentially said that the worker protections of the NLRA gave way to the Federal Arbitration Act, allowing employers to leverage arbitration agreements to have employees sign away their class action rights. And what we have here is, in many ways, more egregious, because that case was at least ostensibly about two conflicting laws. In this case, the court is setting aside the protections of the NLRA based on its own opinions about what undocumented immigrants do and do not deserve.</p>
                        <p>0:17:30.1 Rhiannon: That's it. That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:17:31.5 Peter: And obviously, there's a lot to say about the conservative view of immigrants here, but it's also important to understand that this is part of a broader right-wing effort to atomize workers and stifle the labor movement by telling corporations they're allowed to union bust as long as they're targeting the right people. And it's not just the impact on immigrant workers at this facility, on workers without authorization to work at this facility, it impacts the broader union too. If you're a perfectly, whatever, "legal" worker at Hoffman Plastics and you're trying to unionize and they are targeting your colleagues based on their immigration status and terminating them in order to dismantle or disrupt the union, clearly that impacts those workers. This is bigger than just the rights of these immigrants. And I think that's important to sort of process, that this is... For Hoffman Plastics, it's not just about being racist, that's almost the vessel through which they are union busting.</p>
                        <p>0:18:34.0 Michael: Right. That's right. And Peter mentioned that the prior case, Epic Systems was about two competing laws, whereas this one is not, and I think the court, they sort of see that and they realize that, and so they try to set up a similar scenario by mentioning immigration laws and specifically the IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act. But here's the thing, like Peter said up top, the IRCA doesn't say anything about this. It does make it illegal for someone to provide false documents...</p>
                        <p>0:19:07.4 Rhiannon: In order to gain employment, right.</p>
                        <p>0:19:09.1 Michael: But it provides penalties for that. Those penalties include imprisonment and a fine, but that fine is not your entire wages, right? That is a punishment the court literally just fabricated out of thin air. There's actually a term for that in law when you gain money under some sort of illegal pretense, it's called disgorgement, disgorging someone of their ill-gotten gains. That's not the remedy here, it's just a fine. It's a fine that's gonna be much, much less than what Jose Castro is incurring here. And there's a degree of just straight-up gaslighting, I think in the proper use of that term, by the court, because they use the IRCA as a way of claiming that they are enacting the foreign policy and immigration preferences of the political branches, Congress and the Executive, and saying like, "Look, the NLRA says what it says, but look, immigration law matters," and the IRCA provides this clear statement, that they are totally fabricating, about the way undocumented workers should be treated. But it's gaslighting because, one, again, the IRCA doesn't provide for this penalty at all and it in fact provides for a very different penalty, and, two, because the Department of Justice, which is in charge of enforcing the IRCA disagrees with the court on this.</p>
                        <p>0:20:45.0 Michael: They put in a brief in this case and said that the National Labor Relations Board is right, that this guy is entitled to back pay, that giving him back pay would further the United States interests in its foreign relations with Mexico and Central America and anywhere else where we might be getting undocumented workers from. And that's the thing, the court is claiming to be enforcing our foreign policy, but it's actually subverting it, and we know because the people in charge of our foreign policy told the court. It's fucking nuts, it's nuts that they did this. And I wanna be clear, it's not just like this is a lib versus conservative thing, it was the George W. Bush administration's Department of Justice that was saying, "This is going to undermine our foreign policy." And it was the court being far more conservative than them and sort of anticipating the right-ward drift on immigration that we've seen in the Republican party since then.</p>
                        <p>0:21:46.7 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:21:47.4 Michael: Bush in 2006 tried to pass a comprehensive immigration reform, and it was their racist base that sort of scuttled that and made him lose support within the party. And since then, we've seen the Republican Party get more and more conservative and more and more reactionary on immigration, and this case is very much a leading indicator of that. And so it sort of anticipates the Trumpian turn of the Republican Party.</p>
                        <p>0:22:16.8 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:22:17.5 Peter: Yeah. It's very true. And I think if you're in your early 20s, you probably don't remember the Bush compassionate conservatism pitch, right? There was an angle coming... Clinton was so successful that conservatives in the early aughts were pitching themselves as like, "We're nice now. We're not like Reagan and all them." They thought they had lost, and they needed to shift left. And that was part of it. The softer immigration stance was part of it, 9/11 disrupts it, [chuckle] that's for sure.</p>
                        <p>0:22:46.0 Michael: For sure.</p>
                        <p>0:22:46.4 Peter: And that's why it took till 2006 to get a proposal for immigration reform. But I think that's right, what you currently see in the Republican base is something that hadn't really manifested at the time, and yet you see it coming up at the top of their intellectual movement. From the Supreme Court, you see this prejudice bubbling up before you saw it in the broader politics.</p>
                        <p>0:23:09.4 Michael: Right. And I think it's a good example of something that we say many times but is a particularly vivid illustration, which is that people like Scalia and Rehnquist, they are very much the base, right? They're not different than some MAGA chud. That's what they've always been, and that's why they were worse [chuckle] on undocumented rights than fucking George W. Bush. They are fucking racist pricks. And here's the thing, is like, I'm ranting about foreign policy, but there's a real purpose for that, there's a reason, which is that the court usually defers heavily to the Executive branch on this stuff precisely because it's the area where it views itself as having the least expertise and the least ground constitutionally to intervene. And it's also why the court often gives Congress and the Executive free hand to be particularly awful to immigrants.</p>
                        <p>0:24:15.8 Michael: And we've talked about this in a number of cases, Trump v. Hawaii, I think most memorably, which was the muslim-ban case, which is the US's long history of being just fucking awful, awful to immigrants, and the court giving them the green light on that. And here you have the court not... Instead of giving the government a free hand, making it hard for the government to be even pseudo-decent to undocumented workers and being worse than the Executive and Congress. When Congress and the Executive aren't being racist enough in immigration, the court is there to step in and make sure that they are gonna be. It's fucking gross.</p>
                        <p>0:25:00.1 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's absolutely gross. And let's go to a break.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:25:07.7 Rhiannon: Hey, everybody. Thanks so much for listening to 5-4. If you've already joined us on Patreon, we hope you enjoyed our premium episode about justice Antonin Scalia. If you haven't joined us yet, come see what you're missing out on. So we have special episodes just for subscribers. Those are gonna be bigger picture, maybe longer episodes than our usual. They'll be a little bit more thematic, so episodes about the justices, constitutional interpretation, like originalism and textualism, all that goofy nerd shit that you like. You'll also get discounts on merch membership in the 5-4 Slack with me and Peter and Michael, and access to exclusive events. We already had a really fun first Q&A Zoom with listeners, so join us. You can support by visiting patreon.com/fivefourpod, and you have to spell out five and four. And thanks so much for supporting.</p>
                        <p>0:26:10.4 Rhiannon: And we are back. And this case has me thinking about solidarity across movements. And so it's not only that the court here is really spitting in the face, like you said, Michael, the DOJ submitted a brief and said, "The NLRB is right here. We support that decision. This man should get paid his back pay." And William Rehnquist is like, "No, I don't like undocumented immigrants." That's essentially what happened. But this case is also an example, I think, of broadly how the judiciary, the law inserts itself in this country to drive a wedge and class solidarity movements and solidarity between movements. So I'm thinking about immigration movements and the movement for workers' rights more broadly. There were opportunities over the course of history, the union movement for a long time was sort of anti-immigrant in this country, but there are opportunities all of the time for class solidarity and this kind of movement connectivity and growing and building together, and here, the Court spits in the face of that kind of solidarity as well, and the result is less power across the board for all workers, whether you have citizenship or work authorization or not.</p>
                        <p>0:27:26.8 Michael: Right. And you can see, even if it's not the reality, at least the logic, although I think it is somewhat the reality of the way this pits unionized workers against immigrants, which has become very much a big Republican electoral pitch, because if employers can treat undocumented workers worse, that's gonna dry up opportunities for union jobs. And so unions can see themselves as competing with undocumented workers, and that makes them less powerful.</p>
                        <p>0:27:56.4 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:27:56.9 Michael: To amplify Rhi's point, it's not just spitting in the face, it's literally dividing and conquering.</p>
                        <p>0:28:04.5 Peter: And that's a key component of like, I don't wanna conflate conservatism and fascism entirely, but fascist movements where you're constantly looking for an other, and our reliance on identifying an other that you are then pitted against, a key aspect of the GOP's current pitch to working class White people.</p>
                        <p>0:28:22.3 Rhiannon: That's right, that's right. And this case clearly defines who the other is. That's what this case stands for.</p>
                        <p>0:28:27.8 Peter: Yeah. So, Michael, you were talking about the sort of cultural moment with respect... And political moment with respect to immigration. I think it's important to put that side by side with the socio-political moment with respect to unions. This case is from 2002, it develops during the '90s, and I think it's important to understand the cultural sentiments from that period. The 1970s see the beginnings of a sharp decline in union participation in this country, as neoliberal consensus develops and Democrats aligned with certain business interests, rather than labor. And the '90s and early 2000s, while not the lowest point for unions from a membership perspective, that would be now, by the way, were in a lot of ways the peak of the anti-union cultural movement. Corporate interests were able to frame unions in a way that sort of acutely resonated with particularly American brain diseases. The two-fold idea that unions benefit the lazy while punishing the productive really triggered whatever mutant strain of the Protestant work ethic Americans are working with. And it resonated especially in the '90s when the economy was booming and we're just right after the Soviet Union's collapse, and in general, people sort of thought things were just gonna be great forever. That was the '90s vibes.</p>
                        <p>0:29:45.9 Michael: Is that what the End of History was about?</p>
                        <p>0:29:47.6 Peter: That is what the End of History is about, yeah. The Fukuyama idea. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:29:51.2 Michael: Yeah. That literally social development has reached its final form.</p>
                        <p>0:29:56.1 Peter: Yes. That politics are over. We're just sort of haggling over the details. That was sort of the prevailing political driver in the '90s. And maybe the most notable thing about the prominent anti-union rhetoric you see is that it's become, over the course of the last several decades, increasingly clear that it's just objectively false. It's not that I disagree with the thrust of it or something, It is objectively incorrect. Non-unionized workplaces have not allowed productive employees to succeed, they've resulted in productivity rising every year on average, while wages have stayed largely stagnant. That's not an opinion about unions. That's a fact about unions. And private sector union membership at the time of this opinion was about 9%, now it is about 6%. A lot of people are sort of optimistic after the pandemic that there's been some positive development. That positive development ticked union membership up 0.1% between 2019 and 2020, most of which, I have to say, if I'm being cynical, is probably because of layoffs disproportionately impacting non-unionized employees. Corporations have taken the gray area created by this web of Supreme Court decisions and used it to sort of get union busting down to a science. They hire consulting firms whose specialty is to talk to employees and make them nervous about the prospect of unionizing, and it's extremely effective.</p>
                        <p>0:31:22.4 Peter: We're seeing it right now in Bessemer, Alabama with the Amazon unionization effort, one of the most public in recent memory. 30 years ago, this would have been, I think, an open and shut labor win, but corporations have been whittling down the ability of labor to organize effectively, in large part because the Supreme Court has made the National Labor Relations Act so vague and weak. If the court was interpreting the law as it should, Amazon wouldn't be able to bring in union busting consultants or suspiciously target organizers for discipline or bribe their employees to do pro bono anti-union PR on social media, which is a real thing that Amazon does all the time. So this case is both about the othering of undocumented immigrants in this massive campaign against organized labor in this country, which has been just tremendously successful, and it's only been in recent years, with this rising left wing of the Democratic party and an entire generation of people who have done nothing but lose in the workplace for year after year, and are thinking basically, anything else must be better, surely, surely, unionization must be better and the anti-union rhetoric is just a little bit less effective on these younger generations.</p>
                        <p>0:32:39.4 Peter: I do think there's optimism there, but the fact that Amazon can just bring in fucking consultants that talk to employees and explain to them why unionizing would be a bad choice, and that is not considered interfering with organizing, under the National Labor Relations Act, it blows my fucking mind, it blows my fucking mind.</p>
                        <p>0:33:00.8 Rhiannon: After this decision, and as a result of the sort of web of these judicial decisions, like Peter said, if you do not have work authorization in the US and you are retaliated against in this way, for organizing, for pro-union efforts on the job in the US, you are not entitled to back pay anymore, not just under the NLRA, but under title 7, under the FLSA, the Fair Labor Standards Act. So this whole system, where the only way to hold accountable, employers and supervisors and corporations, to ensuring workplace safety standards, wages that go up with the cost of living, greater healthcare protections, all of that, the only system that we have, in employment and labor law, to hold them to account, the air is completely taken out of it.</p>
                        <p>0:33:49.6 Michael: It is worth mentioning maybe, that the Democratic Party is starting, I think maybe because of the left ward pull or just what's going on in this country, with workers and trying to find inroads with white working class or whatever, or maybe it's just Joe Biden, being that sort of guy, but it does feel like the Democratic Party is maybe a little more pro-union now, than it has been in the past. Under Obama, there's a big union law called the card check law, that died on the vine, even though they had 60 votes in the Senate, and now, they're pushing the PRO Act, which is this very union-empowering act, despite having much narrower margins. And it's worth noting that the PRO Act actually closes this loophole created by Hoffman, and says that just because a worker is undocumented, that doesn't prevent them from getting back pay, if they are fired in violation of labor laws.</p>
                        <p>0:34:49.5 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:34:50.3 Michael: It's definitely something that would be great if passed and the PRO Act has 45 co-sponsors, I think, and is getting close to a vote, Biden put it in his big infrastructure bill, so there seems to be a real effort on it.</p>
                        <p>0:35:04.5 Rhiannon: Yeah. Do you know that Texas is the only state that does not require workers compensation?</p>
                        <p>0:35:09.3 Michael: I didn't know that.</p>
                        <p>0:35:10.3 Peter: I did know that, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:35:11.5 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah. No workers compensation whatsoever, in Texas. It's fucking wild.</p>
                        <p>0:35:15.8 Peter: That's cool. That's dope as hell. I love that there's always one of these outlier states, where you're just like, "Huh, I didn't know you could do that. I didn't know you could just deny people, workers comp. It's crazy."</p>
                        <p>0:35:26.1 Rhiannon: It's wild.</p>
                        <p>0:35:26.7 Peter: Incredible, the innovation you're seeing out of Texas.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:35:30.2 Rhiannon: It's something we've hinted at, throughout this episode, but just to make it explicit, this is just an absolutely egregious and extremely clear example of judicial activism. Again, what conservatives and so-called originalists say they hate from judges. This is a case where Congress has spoken, the executive branch has spoken very clearly, the NLRB has spoken very clearly, about what should happen in these kinds of cases.</p>
                        <p>0:36:00.8 Peter: Literally every stakeholder, except for this company, has spoken out in favor of this guy.</p>
                        <p>0:36:06.7 Rhiannon: That's exactly right. And these five conservatives on the Supreme Court at this time, come out... It's like, "Who are you holding water for? For Hoffman Plastics, my guy? When everybody else has told you they don't want the case to go this way?" Like I said, it's egregious and it's egregious in that it's not only otherising and racializing the workplace in a way to de-humanize undocumented immigrants. We've said it throughout too, this doesn't protect the American worker either. What this decision does is, allows employers to permanently create under-classes at the workplace, that are cheaper to hire, that are easier to fire, and they're not being held accountable in any way, for those decisions.</p>
                        <p>0:36:52.7 Michael: Right, it's writing penalties into the immigration law that don't exist, and it's writing exceptions into our labor laws that don't exist. It's absolutely the pinnacle of legislating from the bench.</p>
                        <p>0:37:05.6 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:37:06.0 Peter: Yeah. There are a whole section of industries, restaurants, manufacturing, especially, that rely on what they know is undocumented labor.</p>
                        <p>0:37:17.6 Rhiannon: Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>0:37:18.4 Peter: Yeah, there's a ton of them. And Rhi had hinted up top, they are in a situation where management knows that if you just dug a little bit more aggressively than you're digging, you will be forced to let a huge chunk of your workforce go.</p>
                        <p>0:37:31.9 Rhiannon: Right. Because they don't have work authorization.</p>
                        <p>0:37:34.3 Peter: Right. And that means it's illegal for the companies to employ them. That means that these people are particularly vulnerable. Not only can they have their employment leveraged, like any employee can have their employment leveraged by their employer, but their existence in this country is being held in the hands of some fucking company and that is the sort of regime that exists today. Everyone knows that this happens, everyone in these industries... At the top of these industries benefits from it, and yet when they are put into the right circumstance will leverage the vulnerability of these people that they profit off of and exploit it to increase their bottom line by some fucking nominal amount. This is the difference between minimum wage and probably a few bucks more and health benefits, that's what this unionization effort in the the late '80s would have been about, but there's something particularly disgusting about watching the people who knowingly benefit from this system, from this structure, leverage their vulnerability of the people they are exploiting to union bust. It's whatever the opposite of intersectionality is, that's what this is. It's fucking vile.</p>
                        <p>0:38:46.5 Michael: Yeah, and I think it's good we've talked a lot about the laws and we've talked about employers and unions and stuff, but I do think it's good to take it back to individuals and the people who are harmed by this and the atmosphere they live in, and to remember that that's what this does, is, creates a world where... Here are people coming to the US because their home countries are in turmoil or don't offer them any significant opportunities, and they're hoping for something better, and we are putting them in a permanent state of fear and a state of just complete... For lack of a better word, vulnerability or... It's like they've got the fucking Sword of Damocles hanging over their head every day. Every day, their boss, if they're not happy with them could ruin their lives, absolutely ruin their lives. Not just dock their pay or fire them, get them fucking evicted from this country. It's horrific, it's a horrific way that our economy runs.</p>
                        <p>0:39:55.3 Peter: I have one last thing to say, which is that we haven't mentioned the dissent, and that's 'cause it's written by Justice Pryor, which means it's like just really sort of dull, inadequate work that any second year attorney could do. Retire you bum motherfucker, that continues to be our position.</p>
                        <p>0:40:12.9 Michael: Yeah. Yeah. No, I did wanna mention the dissent, I'm glad you reminded me, because it hit...</p>
                        <p>0:40:15.8 Peter: You're welcome.</p>
                        <p>0:40:16.5 Michael: There's not a single point, I think we hit in this, that the dissent misses, but it does it in the fucking most milk-toast way with the almost toothless language that... Man, it anticipates so much of what has happened in the way this will change workplace conditions and encourage undocumented workers to come by creating more job opportunities for them, from employers who are happy to take on a workforce they can treat poorly, but the opinion lays it out in a way, it's like some academic debate bullshit, like it should be righteous and it's not, it's absolutely not.</p>
                        <p>0:40:57.2 Peter: We've hated on Ginsburg in the past but she would have done a much better job. This is her forte.</p>
                        <p>0:41:01.7 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:41:02.7 Michael: Yeah, she's good on labor issues, she knows how to write with values in mind.</p>
                        <p>0:41:07.8 Rhiannon: Absolutely, yeah.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:41:12.9 Peter: Next week, patreon-only episode on the Insular Cases, a series of decisions from 1901 about the territories that we acquired during the Spanish-American War. I don't know if you guys know about Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>0:41:31.3 Rhiannon: I do, yes. Are you talking to me or the listeners?</p>
                        <p>0:41:34.2 Peter: No, you.</p>
                        <p>0:41:34.6 Rhiannon: Oh yeah. No, I'm aware of Puerto Rico. Thanks Peter.</p>
                        <p>0:41:36.9 Michael: I've been there, it's a cool country.</p>
                        <p>0:41:39.8 Peter: It's a great entirely separate nation.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:41:43.5 Peter: Some questions you might have? You're a casual fan of Puerto Rico, might be like, Why can't they vote? What's going on there? On election night, they'll be like, Puerto Rico voted for Biden.</p>
                        <p>0:41:52.2 Rhiannon: But it doesn't matter.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:41:53.0 Peter: It does not count. It's like on Survivor when someone plays an idol, it's like, does not count. The idol has been played against Puerto Rico. That's a joke that all of our listeners will love and relate to.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:42:07.0 Peter: So, we thought it might be useful to cover the cases that explain exactly why territories are relegated to the second tier status that they are, and why perhaps it might be useful to elevate them to the status of actual citizens who live in a real place where they can exercise rights and things like that. All those cool things that are in the constitution, I don't know if you guys know about that.</p>
                        <p>0:42:29.4 Michael: I've heard of it.</p>

                        <p>0:00:07.2 Rhiannon: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze... Haha, just kidding. I would never. Peter is too good at the metaphors. Hey, everybody, it's Rhiannon. This week we've got something cool for you. Katy and Cody over at Even More News invited us to be guests on their show this week. They wanted us to talk about voting rights cases at the Supreme Court, talk about HR1 a little bit, and also to explain very capably, without any stumbles at all, absolutely flawlessly explain the filibuster. So definitely tune in for that.</p>
                        <p>0:00:44.2 Rhiannon: We had such a good time hanging out with them that we wanted to share the episode in our feed with all of our listeners this week, and if you end up liking the show and you wanna subscribe, you can find them wherever you get your podcasts, just search for Even More News.</p>
                        <p>0:01:00.5 Rhiannon: Next week, we've got another case episode for you. It's Hoffman Plastics v. The National Labor Relations Board, really cool case about the bad parts of immigration law, the bad parts of labor law, all mixed in into one. But for now, go ahead and enjoy Even More News. See ya.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:01:21.1 Katy: Hello and welcome back to Even More News, the first and only news podcast. My name is Katy Stoll.</p>
                        <p>0:01:30.4 Cody: Hi, accurate, Katy Stoll, name, mine is Cody Johnston.</p>
                        <p>0:01:35.7 Katy: We got there eventually, folks! And hey, guess what, this is nothing to see here, [chuckle] just a normal episode of Even More News, except, wait a second, what's this breaking news? April Fools, you fools! We got you good. 'Cause today is not actually April Fools. Yesterday was April Fools. Also, this is not a normal episode of Even More News. Today, we are having a very special crossover event with the hosts of 5-4 pod, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael. Hi, guys!</p>
                        <p>0:02:06.1 Rhiannon: Hi!</p>
                        <p>0:02:06.4 Peter: Hey...</p>
                        <p>0:02:07.7 Katy: We are so...</p>
                        <p>0:02:08.4 Peter: Thanks for having us.</p>
                        <p>0:02:09.2 Michael: Hey!</p>
                        <p>0:02:09.4 Katy: Thrilled to have you. Yes, we are so excited to have you. I feel like I've said that in every single email I sent planning this. [chuckle] A while back, I actually had tweeted that we were looking to speak with a constitutional lawyer, and I received an overwhelming amount of responses from our listeners saying that, "You guys have to have the 5-4 pod guys on, it's gonna be epic." I don't wanna put that pressure on to make it epic, but we are thrilled to finally make it happen. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:02:40.9 Rhiannon: The first time that Twitter had like good positive results.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:02:44.4 Katy: Yeah, okay, cool, I like it.</p>
                        <p>0:02:45.4 Cody: First and last, yes.</p>
                        <p>0:02:46.2 Katy: First and last. Just like this is the first and only news podcast. Isn't that wild that there aren't more...</p>
                        <p>0:02:52.9 Cody: One day.</p>
                        <p>0:02:53.4 Peter: I would have thought that there would be more, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:02:55.2 Katy: At this point, after the last four years, anyway. Before we get started today, I just want... We just wanna get to know you guys a little bit. Why don't you start by telling us about your show and what you guys are doing over there?</p>
                        <p>0:03:09.2 Rhiannon: Yeah, sure. So I'm Rhiannon, and along with Michael and Peter, my co-hosts here, we have a podcast about the Supreme Court and how much it sucks. [laughter] Broadly, we kind of offer like leftist critique of Supreme Court cases, especially in the modern conservative era. We cover a different Supreme Court case every episode, and we basically just talk about how problematic it is, and what a political circus the Supreme Court is, contrary to popular belief.</p>
                        <p>0:03:43.4 Rhiannon: Our very first episode was about Bush v. Gore. We've covered affirmative action cases, abortion cases, cases on the power of the police. And actually, we just started a Patreon where listeners can sign up for premium episodes about like specific justices, like Antonin Scalia, or all the stupid ways like law school teaches you the Constitution should be interpreted. And we've been having fun in Zoom chats and on Slack with patrons also, so it's a good time. We're really excited to be here.</p>
                        <p>0:04:16.0 Peter: Wow, you're really selling it, Rhi, thank you.</p>
                        <p>0:04:17.0 Katy: Yeah, I mean, I was sold already 'cause I've listened and I love it, but what you've laid out is the exact demographic of our show. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:04:26.0 Rhiannon: Amazing.</p>
                        <p>0:04:27.7 Katy: I think that our listeners are gonna love it. How did you guys... What are your backgrounds? How did you guys start working together?</p>
                        <p>0:04:35.1 Rhiannon: Oh, we're all lawyers.</p>
                        <p>0:04:36.7 Katy: Yeah, you are.</p>
                        <p>0:04:38.2 Rhiannon: We're all lawyers and we're all lawyers online.</p>
                        <p>0:04:40.8 Cody: That'll do it.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:04:43.1 Rhiannon: Yeah. [laughter] It was the World Wide Web that brought us together. No, but I'm a public defender down in Texas, and Peter and Michael are, I don't know, the stupid kind of lawyer?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:04:55.7 Katy: And what would that be?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:05:00.1 Peter: I consider myself a regular lawyer, that's... When people ask what I do, regular lawyer.</p>
                        <p>0:05:05.1 Katy: When I think of a stupid lawyer, I kind of think of like a Giuliani or something, and so far, you guys are far more impressive.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:05:12.0 Michael: Right. I did some corporate work and also some political work, worked for a PAC, founded a PAC, so yeah, not that stupid a lawyer, Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:05:27.6 Katy: You had to go through quite a lot of school, whatever kind of lawyering you're doing, so...</p>
                        <p>0:05:33.9 Michael: That was stupid, I will attest, that was a stupid decision.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:05:40.5 Katy: I think I'm smart enough to know that you're smarter than me, which is why I was smart enough to have you on here today to talk to us about voting rights, [chuckle] which is what we're about to get to. But you guys mentioned a Patreon, how long have you guys had that up? We wanna definitely funnel people over there. Maybe I should save that for the end, but I might as well mention it twice.</p>
                        <p>0:06:01.9 Peter: Yeah, we've been doing it for like a month. Is that right? Just like a little over a month, not long.</p>
                        <p>0:06:06.8 Katy: Well, welcome. I've found it to be, I don't speak for Cody...</p>
                        <p>0:06:11.4 Cody: You can, go ahead.</p>
                        <p>0:06:12.7 Katy: A game-changer, truly liberating. Cody and I are both very grateful to Patreon.com, [chuckle] yeah, to build a community like that and to just... It takes away needing to answer a higher-up, you get to... You have a community of people supporting the things that they believe in, and it's been a really beautiful experience for us, so I'm excited for you guys.</p>
                        <p>0:06:34.6 Peter: It's been fun.</p>
                        <p>0:06:35.2 Rhiannon: Yeah, we're really pumped too.</p>
                        <p>0:06:37.4 Peter: It's very like... I feel like instead of having to answer to higher corporate powers, instead we are subject to the whims of our disgusting listeners.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:06:46.6 Peter: Who we despise.</p>
                        <p>0:06:50.2 Cody: It's a different kind of resentment. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:06:52.4 Katy: Yeah. I feel like we should get started, 'cause we've got a lot to go through. I already mentioned that today we are going to be talking about voting rights. Recently, this has been in the news, it's been in the news a lot, but especially this month, 'cause earlier in March, the House passed HR1. We're gonna talk about HR1 in depth later on. But for right now, I'll just say that it is an overall of Federal Voting regulations, if it passes the Senate, which probably won't happen, if we at the very least don't amend the filibuster, but if it did, it would make many changes to voting rights, campaign finance, ethics regulations.</p>
                        <p>0:07:31.4 Katy: And while this is long overdue, it's even more urgent, as we are seeing Republican legislators planning to pass all sorts of state-level laws targeting voting rights, and sure enough, last week, we just saw that Georgia passed several restricted changes to their voting laws that blatantly and disproportionately affect communities of color, with restrictions like requiring ID for mail-in voting, making it illegal to pass out food or water in voting lines, lines that if you recall from your recent memory, it can be long and hot. I believe they are also reducing the number of early voting drop boxes and moving them inside, limiting the hours that voting would be available.</p>
                        <p>0:08:16.1 Katy: This is widely been declared a Jim Crow 2.0, and the optics certainly weren't help when the law was signed in front of a plantation painting or the fact that Democratic State Rep Park Cannon, who is a black woman, was arrested as she knocked on the door to the News Cuff Conference and was dragged through the capital in handcuffs. Three different groups immediately filed lawsuits, and I say all of this to kinda set the stage for our conversation today, and I guess I'm gonna let you guys take this from here, 'cause like I mentioned, you're always smarter than me, or Cody. Sorry, Cody. We're gonna do our best.</p>
                        <p>0:09:00.6 Cody: It's true, believe me.</p>
                        <p>0:09:01.5 Katy: We're just gonna try to listen and ask intelligent questions as best as we can.</p>
                        <p>0:09:06.4 Cody: Intelligent questions.</p>
                        <p>0:09:08.3 Katy: And if we mess up, it's fine 'cause it'll get edited out anyway.</p>
                        <p>0:09:11.5 Cody: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:09:13.1 Peter: Perfect.</p>
                        <p>0:09:13.2 Katy: But yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:09:15.5 Peter: Yeah. The Georgia bill is particularly egregious. The food and water thing, when I first heard it, I sort of was like, well, maybe they're getting at some like, I don't really... Maybe this is being misconstrued a little bit, and I looked into it and was like, "No, no." That's it, you just... No little water bottles in line. One out of every three voting machines is gonna be booby-trapped, I think, as part of it.</p>
                        <p>0:09:41.4 Katy: I always sneak in extra ballots through water bottles, so maybe this was smart, you know?</p>
                        <p>0:09:47.8 Peter: Yeah, I think the idea is that if I'm going in and I'm gonna vote for Trump, and then someone hands me a bottle of water and they're wearing a Biden shirt, I'm like, "Maybe I'm going about this all wrong."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:10:01.5 Katy: I was gonna vote for Trump, but this Biden guy gave me a one bottle of water.</p>
                        <p>0:10:07.0 Peter: Yeah, I think that the place to start with voting rights is in the Constitution, and when you take a step back and conceptualize this as the arc of history, the original constitutional structure essentially provides no right to vote and was designed to kind of construct an oligarchy, almost explicitly. So all the original Constitution says about voting is that voting requirements for congressional elections are determined by the states, and for presidential elections, each state appoints its own electors who vote for the President.</p>
                        <p>0:10:47.4 Peter: And obviously now, those electors are pretty much symbolic, but that's not how they were intended, they were intended to be our oligarchic rulers, the guy with the tallest top hat in the room is your elector.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:11:00.9 Peter: And so, no real right to vote in the Constitution as it's originally written. That sort of changes after the Civil War, when the Reconstruction Amendments are passed, and they don't create a right to vote, but they sort of refer to rights to vote in the 14th and 15th Amendments, mostly with the intent of protecting the black vote, the freed slave vote after the War, and to sort of despite that for the nearly a century, you still see tons of what we would now view as voter suppressive tactics, poll taxes, literacy tests, all sorts of obstruction, and things only really start to shift in the '50s and '60s.</p>
                        <p>0:11:44.1 Peter: The 24th Amendment passes in 1964, and that ban's literacy tests. In '65, the Voting Rights Act is passed. And at the same time, the Supreme Court under Earl Warren, the famous liberal Chief Justice, is handing down these seminal decisions that are protecting voting rights, using those Reconstruction Amendments as his basis and creating a principle of one man, one vote. So in 1966, the Court strikes down pretty explicitly racist redistricting practices, they strike down poll taxes the same year, and so that, combined with the Voting Rights Act, and there's sort of this new normal where the individual right to vote is relatively strong, and it sort of stays that way. Conservatives take over the Court later in the 20th century, and the right to vote gets a little bit weaker.</p>
                        <p>0:12:41.2 Peter: But I think the turning point is sort of Bush v. Gore, which was sort of this revelatory moment for conservatives who were like, "Oh, we can do anything." If you get away with stealing an election while everyone's looking, then the sort of limits of what you can use the courts for are boundless. And so, something we talk about on our podcast a lot is like 10, 15 years ago, a huge part of the political conversation was like, "What are Republicans gonna do?" The electorate's getting less white, it's getting younger, the demographics are shifting and they're gonna need to start changing their politics, and instead they were just like, "Maybe not everybody votes."</p>
                        <p>0:13:19.9 Rhiannon: Yeah. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:13:21.7 Cody: Or instead of that...</p>
                        <p>0:13:25.4 Cody: It sounds hard. Sounds like a lot of hard work. Instead of...</p>
                        <p>0:13:30.3 Peter: Yeah, there's a really long conference call where someone was like, "Guys, I don't mean to be out of line here, but what if?" And that guy is Mitch McConnell. That's really the lesson. And yeah, I mean, with that, with that sort of political strategy came a legal strategy. And so modern conservative legal scholars have latched on to the idea that is enshrined in the Constitution that states control their own elections. States control their own elections to some degree. And of course, that's sort of in the narrow sense unquestionably true, but they've sort of interpreted it in such a way that is designed to give states free rein to pass all sorts of voter suppressive tactics and laws in order to combat what they are presenting as ostensible fraud, which of course is a slightly exaggerated form of what is actually happening.</p>
                        <p>0:14:33.8 Katy: Slightly? Yeah, you could say that.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:14:38.1 Rhiannon: So I think that kind of brings us to the modern Supreme Court and the treatment of voting rights during the Chief Justice John Roberts era. So a really important case that came down in 2013 is a case called Shelby County, and this was a case that is known as kind of gutting the Voting Rights Act. So this is a majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, and just to note that before John Roberts was Chief Justice John Roberts, when he was a younger lawyer working in the '80s during the Reagan administration, he was writing tons of memos about how the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional and shouldn't be expanded.</p>
                        <p>0:15:27.5 Rhiannon: And so all of this sort of the conservative legal movement that has grown around sort of suppressing the vote and trying to pick away at the Voting Rights Act, that has really just continued with John Roberts now in the position of Chief Justice on the Supreme Court. So talking about Shelby County, Shelby County, like I said, is a 2013 case out of Alabama, and it concerns the Voting Rights Act. Under the Voting Rights Act that Peter mentioned, it prohibited racial discrimination in voting sort of broadly, but there are some really complicated provisions in there for trying to make that a reality in the United States.</p>
                        <p>0:16:11.5 Rhiannon: So in Shelby County, though, the Supreme Court held that the formula that's set out in the Voting Rights Act, this formula that sets out which jurisdictions get federal oversight over changing their voting laws, because those jurisdictions had been racist in creating voting laws in the past, the Shelby County decision holds that that formula is unconstitutional. So broadly speaking, this is completely gutting the Voting Rights Act, because the law really only means something... It only has accountability measures for these places that have a history of racist voting restrictions, if that formula is in place for determining which places are historically racist.</p>
                        <p>0:16:57.4 Rhiannon: And Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, he justifies that holding in two really dumb ways. First, he's got this long tangent about state sovereignty. Like Peter said earlier, they're always balancing this individual right to vote versus a state's right to carry out elections and voting the way the state deems it wants to do so. And so there's a long tangent about state sovereignty in Shelby County, and then there's this other tangent that Roberts goes on, where he's talking about how voter turnout is actually up in these historically racist jurisdictions. You know, racial discrimination is now not so much of a problem anymore, and so we don't need this Voting Rights Act coverage the same way we used to need it. And of course, he leaves completely unsaid that the entire reason voter turnout is up and discrimination in voting is lower is because of the Voting Rights Act.</p>
                        <p>0:18:05.5 Katy: I just don't understand how you get away with that. I mean, I do understand, but it's like, "Come on. You're not even exactly saying... You're saying it out loud without saying it out loud."</p>
                        <p>0:18:19.2 Rhiannon: Yes. Yeah. Absolutely. A big part of our podcast is about how the Supreme Court is often saying the quiet parts of the conservative legal movement. They're saying the quiet parts out loud, and it seems like nobody is really getting that.</p>
                        <p>0:18:32.6 Katy: Well, you dress it up in big words and make it sound one way, and people are like, "I don't know. I'm not gonna dissect this." I don't know, that's a simplistic answer, but anyway...</p>
                        <p>0:18:42.7 Rhiannon: No, that's exactly right. It's absolutely part of the political game of the GOP. So as a result, as a direct result of the Shelby County decision, the consequences are sort of... They're nearly immediate. You get relentless systemic voter disenfranchisement and suppression. Within 24 hours of the ruling, which was, again, back in 2013, Texas said that it was going to be enforcing its voter ID law without getting pre-clearance from the federal government, for example, and the decision also directly resulted in states all over the country passing laws that did a whole host of voter suppressive stuff. Stuff like removing online voting registration and early voting, implementing voter ID laws, purging voters off of the registration rolls, closing polling locations on and on and on.</p>
                        <p>0:19:42.9 Rhiannon: And there have been studies about the effects of the Shelby County ruling. Five years after the decision, thousands of polling locations had been closed across the country. The US Commission on Civil Rights, in fact, found that after the ruling there had been an increase in discriminatory laws that made it harder for minorities to vote, and that same year, that would have been 2018, the Brennan Center issued a report that found that the Shelby County decision alone, by itself, was responsible for the purge of two million people from voter rolls across the country in just three years.</p>
                        <p>0:20:21.7 Cody: Wow.</p>
                        <p>0:20:22.0 Rhiannon: So all of that to say that the Roberts Court knows what it's doing, and cases like Shelby County fit into a broader conservative project of this voter suppression, right? And there are other examples from the Roberts Court, big cases, a case called Rucho v. Common Cause, that's a case that where the Court ruled that partisan gerrymandering is just this purely political issue for which federal courts, they just can't touch it, they can't decide those issues. And there's another really important one, it's important to the conversation about HR1 that we're about to have, an important case called Husted. This is a 2018 case out of Ohio in which the court upheld the state's voter caging scheme, which had resulted in hundreds of thousands of otherwise eligible voters to be purged from the state's voter rolls.</p>
                        <p>0:21:17.1 Rhiannon: So what Ohio had done, it's just as egregious, and also stupid as it sounds. What Ohio had done was implement this system in which people who had failed to vote in the previous two years were sent a notice in the mail to confirm their voter status. And if you failed to respond to that mail, to that notice, then you were just taken off of the voter rolls in Ohio. And the majority ruling in Husted, the majority ruling at the Supreme Court, said basically that even though federal law says you can't purge people off of registered voter lists solely because they sit out an election cycle, well, Ohio was doing something different, because it was purging people off of voter lists who had maybe sat out an election cycle, and they got a notice in the mail. See what they did there?</p>
                        <p>0:22:09.1 Cody: Yeah, they didn't read the fine print. [laughter] They didn't opt-in, you're automatically opted-out unless you do this.</p>
                        <p>0:22:15.1 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:22:15.6 Katy: It's just like the easiest possible loophole that you can find.</p>
                        <p>0:22:18.8 Cody: It's cable company shit. It's like, it's so insidious.</p>
                        <p>0:22:22.6 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:22:23.0 Katy: I mean, I'm an active voter, and I would definitely... I mean, I would miss something like that very easily, a junk mailer...</p>
                        <p>0:22:30.9 Cody: I don't check my mail.</p>
                        <p>0:22:32.7 Rhiannon: Totally.</p>
                        <p>0:22:33.3 Katy: Shoved into all the advertisement things that you always just recycle.</p>
                        <p>0:22:38.4 Rhiannon: Yeah, and studies and briefing for that case at the Supreme Court showed that it was really hard for people to get back even when they wanted to be active voters. It was really hard for people to respond to something as minor as just getting this notice in the mail. And you know, Justice Sotomayor wrote in dissent in the Husted case, a dissent that we largely agree with, and she said that this kind of system puts too much of an onus on registered voters to stay registered, and it also disproportionately burdens minority communities, the poor, and disabled voters in particular.</p>
                        <p>0:23:16.0 Rhiannon: So we move now to looking forward a little bit. This past month, the issue of voting rights was again before the Supreme Court, and we don't have a ruling on these cases yet, but voting rights are again gravely at risk now with a 6-3 conservative super majority deciding the issue here. And so there were two cases, actually, that were argued earlier in March. The first is Brnovich v. DNC, the Democratic National Committee, and the other one is a case called Arizona Republican Party v. DNC. Both of these cases...</p>
                        <p>0:23:54.6 Peter: And by the way, Rhi, sorry to interrupt, but a cool tip, if you're not a lawyer, is if you ever see a political party on one side of the V in a Supreme Court case, terrible news, a bad thing is coming.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:24:08.9 Katy: Thank you, that is helpful. I'm not familiar with all of this.</p>
                        <p>0:24:12.3 Cody: Also weirdly, specifically, the Arizona GOP.</p>
                        <p>0:24:14.7 Michael: Yeah, they make a lot of appearances.</p>
                        <p>0:24:17.2 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:24:18.4 Michael: And Arizona voting in general.</p>
                        <p>0:24:21.7 Rhiannon: These folks are litigious. So yeah, both of these cases are out of Arizona, and they're both challenges to two Arizona laws that make it more difficult to vote. So the first is a law that requires voting officials in Arizona to discard ballots cast in the wrong precinct in their entirety. So instead of simply not counting votes for local candidates, who the voter should not have been able to vote for, like perhaps counting the votes for say state-wide offices or state-wide elections, this law requires that voting officials cast out the entire ballot if it's incorrectly cast in the wrong precinct.</p>
                        <p>0:25:05.5 Rhiannon: The second is a law that prohibits many forms of what's called ballot collection, where a voter might fill out their absentee ballot completely legally and completely in good faith, they would fill out their absentee ballot and then, say, give it to someone else and that person delivers the ballot to the election office. This law prohibits many forms of that kind of ballot collection, which if you're paying attention, makes it harder to submit your ballot, right?</p>
                        <p>0:25:33.3 Katy: Yeah, this is what we hear of as ballot harvesting a lot...</p>
                        <p>0:25:39.1 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:39.6 Katy: People inflame that and try to make it sound like something it isn't.</p>
                        <p>0:25:44.4 Rhiannon: Exactly, right. And the risk here, with the decision on these cases at the Supreme Court, which we don't know which way it's gonna come down, but based on these past cases that I've talked about in the Roberts Court on voting rights issues, it's pretty scary. The risk isn't necessarily just that these laws in Arizona would be upheld, and it makes it harder for people to vote there, but also that the Court issues a ruling that sort of further weakens the Voting Rights Act, just like they did in Shelby County. So if the Court rules on these cases that there are limits to certain provisions of the Voting Rights Act, it would basically give state officials really sweeping broad authority to enact racist election laws.</p>
                        <p>0:26:34.3 Michael: Yeah. Good stuff.</p>
                        <p>0:26:35.5 Katy: This is a lot.</p>
                        <p>0:26:37.8 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, where we stand now...</p>
                        <p>0:26:41.4 Katy: Clear eyed, full hearts, could very, very easily lose. So the Voting Rights Act already has been gutted effectively in the places that it is needed, and these upcoming cases would be like the nails in the coffin.</p>
                        <p>0:27:03.2 Rhiannon: Right. It sort of just further threatens voter rights nationwide.</p>
                        <p>0:27:06.4 Michael: It very much could be, but there is some hope...</p>
                        <p>0:27:10.0 Katy: Here we go, I love a hopeful.</p>
                        <p>0:27:12.4 Michael: And this show is called Even More News, we should actually talk about some news, right?</p>
                        <p>0:27:16.6 Katy: I would love that.</p>
                        <p>0:27:17.7 Michael: So we should talk about HR1, though, We The People Act. Which, one thing that is nice is that back at the top of the episode, Peter mentioned that a lot of times voting rights is this sort of balance between the individual voter against a state's, individual state's, ability to manage its own elections. But the Constitution actually gives Federal Congress the power to override the states, and it says Congress may at any time by law make or alter the regulations, 'cause it has to be able to govern its own elections, in federal elections.</p>
                        <p>0:28:01.0 Michael: And so that gives Congress a lot of power to legislate here, in addition to the Reconstruction Amendments, like the 14th and 15th Amendment, which not only refer to a right to vote, but give Congress the power to legislate to enforce it. And the Democrats have taken, seized that moment here with the We The People Act, and it is a big, comprehensive and very strong bill. It covers voting stuff, it covers campaign finance stuff, it covers ethics rules, it's way too much to go into in detail.</p>
                        <p>0:28:42.2 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's a lot, it's like 800 pages.</p>
                        <p>0:28:44.3 Michael: I read every one.</p>
                        <p>0:28:45.4 Rhiannon: You did not.</p>
                        <p>0:28:46.5 Michael: I'm gonna say I did. Nobody can prove otherwise. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:28:51.1 Katy: Wow. I believe that you did.</p>
                        <p>0:28:56.0 Michael: But I do wanna talk about...</p>
                        <p>0:28:57.1 Katy: Real quick, I feel like so many lawmakers do not read all the text, right? That has to be true.</p>
                        <p>0:29:01.9 Michael: No, it's usually only a few key lawmakers on important committees and stuff, and then they sort of distribute literature breaking it down.</p>
                        <p>0:29:12.7 Katy: Gotta say, it makes me nervous anyway.</p>
                        <p>0:29:15.3 Cody: Don't love it, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:29:16.5 Katy: How many people do not read the laws they're passing? What were you gonna say?</p>
                        <p>0:29:20.2 Rhiannon: No, no, fun fact, Michael is the only person in America who actually reads the legislative text of all of these bills.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:29:30.0 Rhiannon: That's a big responsibility for you, Michael.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:29:32.5 Michael: So I do wanna talk, the voting stuff is fantastic. It's really, really great. The voter registration stuff is super comprehensive. It includes automatic voter registration, which means any time you give your information to a state government, you would be registered to vote, and you'd have to affirmatively opt out of that. So you get your driver's license, you go to school, universities would become registering institutions.</p>
                        <p>0:30:02.2 Katy: This is all common sense, that's common sense to me.</p>
                        <p>0:30:05.1 Cody: Or the idea that you decide if you don't want to be registered to vote. The baseline is you can vote now.</p>
                        <p>0:30:13.1 Michael: Right, exactly. The baseline is you're an eligible voter, so we're registering to you to vote and if you want out, that's fine, but otherwise if we know who you are we're gonna make you a voter. And it makes it super easy. It mandates online registration, including updating your information, it mandates same day registration, so you could go to the polls on election day and register to vote if you are not yet registered or registered in the wrong place. It mandates 15 days of early voting, including at least, I think, two weekend days, which is excellent, that's a big way that the Republican Party has tried to limit access to the ballot. It makes mail voting very easy and expansive, it has to be accessible to everyone, it has to include return postage, so you don't have to have ballot harvesting issues, you can just stick it in the mail.</p>
                        <p>0:31:11.2 Katy: Does it also include something about all mail-in ballots have to be in a certain class of postage, so that it is true and accurate delivery time?</p>
                        <p>0:31:20.1 Michael: Yeah, that's my understanding as well. Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:31:21.3 Katy: Okay.</p>
                        <p>0:31:22.8 Michael: It also, I think something I'm really excited about, it mandates the re-enfranchisement of former felons upon release from prison. This is a live issue right now in Florida, where by ballot referenda the citizens tried to re-enfranchised former felons and the Republican legislature immediately knee-capped it by saying, "Even if you served your time if you haven't paid all your fees, you're still not... You haven't completed your sentence so you still don't get your rights restored. Oh, and by the way we don't know what fees you owe, and we won't be able to tell you what fees you owe until 2026 at the earliest. So sorry, it's gonna be eight plus years before you can vote."</p>
                        <p>0:32:10.0 Peter: Democracy, baby.</p>
                        <p>0:32:10.1 Katy: It makes my blood boil. All of it. Sorry to keep interjecting. Everything and all of it. And just the, yes, very blatant tactic of, "We just don't want people to vote. We don't want you to show up because then the only people who will show up are white, wealthy people."</p>
                        <p>0:32:29.0 Michael: It responds directly to the Husted... Hyusted? Hoosted? Decision that... Husted?</p>
                        <p>0:32:35.5 Peter: I thought it was Husted, I'm gonna be honest, until Rhi started saying Hyusted, and now I don't know.</p>
                        <p>0:32:39.7 Katy: Husted sounds like a cool action movie.</p>
                        <p>0:32:43.3 Cody: It does.</p>
                        <p>0:32:44.0 Rhiannon: I'm gonna be honest, I didn't know for sure. And what I said to myself, is what I say to myself before I go into court, which is fake it till you make it." You just gotta say it confidently.</p>
                        <p>0:32:53.1 Peter: Yeah, just believe.</p>
                        <p>0:32:53.2 Katy: I do it all the time. I really do. I get a lot of feedback for that, but it works for the moment, and that's all I care about.</p>
                        <p>0:33:03.4 Michael: But it says that decision was wrong, it prohibits caging efforts, which is when you send mail, and then if you get it like returned, non-forwardable mail, if you get it returned, kicking people off the rolls, it reaffirms that not voting in an election cycle or two is not grounds to remove someone from the rolls, so it would undo that decision and make it much harder to purge the voter rolls. It cracks down on a really loathsome practice called prison gerrymandering. Prisons are used to boost the populations of conservative rural areas with non-voters, right.</p>
                        <p>0:33:46.7 Michael: It's pulling minorities out of urban areas and putting them into rural areas and increasing the power of conservative areas without changing the actual demographic make-up of the voting population. It's pretty gross.</p>
                        <p>0:34:03.2 Katy: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:34:04.4 Peter: Just like direct parallel to the Three-fifths compromise.</p>
                        <p>0:34:06.7 Cody: I was gonna say, that's exactly it. That's so transparent.</p>
                        <p>0:34:12.4 Michael: It also generally cracks down on partisan gerrymandering overall by mandating that congressional districts are drawn by an independent commission. You know, I've seen this provision criticized by some people who don't think independent commissions are all that great, but I will tell you what, it is far, far preferable to what we have now.</p>
                        <p>0:34:34.1 Katy: Yeah, what's...</p>
                        <p>0:34:35.4 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:34:36.5 Katy: The alternative...</p>
                        <p>0:34:37.1 Michael: I think the alternative is literally like... It is like proportional representation in multi-member districts, that's the only true way to... And some sort of redistricting shenanigans, it is just proportional representation. So in addition to all that good stuff, there's also lots of good campaign finance stuff: Dark money disclosure requirements especially, and cracking down on all the ways that disclosure requirements are already sort of evaded, and the Senate Bill has a nice federal matching funds for small donor fueled Senate campaigns. So if you reject large...</p>
                        <p>0:35:20.6 Katy: So the Senate bill would be addition to [0:35:22.9] ____.</p>
                        <p>0:35:23.1 Michael: Right. So HR1 passed the House, and Senate Bill 1 is now under discussion in the Senate, which is very, very similar. But it includes the matching funds for Senate races, which is six to one matching funds, if you go the small donor route. There's other stuff in there like about legislative findings in case they want... In order to pass a new Voting Rights Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is a separate bill that's working its way through Congress, legislative findings in support of making DC a state, which is itself another bill, I think it's HR 51, that's making its way through Congress, so yeah, there's a lot of stuff in here, that of course... Yeah, it's a great bill.</p>
                        <p>0:36:10.7 Rhiannon: HR1 rules. That's the conclusion.</p>
                        <p>0:36:12.9 Katy: Yeah, and it's kind of thrilling to see a bill that I do...</p>
                        <p>0:36:19.7 Michael: Yeah, it's ambitious.</p>
                        <p>0:36:20.7 Katy: Like so much. You know, without as many things where you're like, I wish this, I wish that, yeah, no, wait, that's a really kinda, kinda nailing it here.</p>
                        <p>0:36:31.2 Cody: And for you, it's just knowing like, yeah, as it builds and builds and builds, it's like you have to chip away at so many things.</p>
                        <p>0:36:37.1 Michael: Right, and one thing I wanted to mention also is that it prohibits voter ID loss, which is very nice as well. So you could same day register just with like a affidavit and a signature. So really, really nice.</p>
                        <p>0:36:53.9 Katy: One thing that I saw that I thought was cool, and I don't have it in front of me, 'cause that would be too smart, but some sort of a change to the rules, spending rules, that you could use campaign funds for, let's say, child care for candidates, personal expenses, which opens the door for more people... For more people to run for office.</p>
                        <p>0:37:20.1 Michael: It makes it more accessible.</p>
                        <p>0:37:21.9 Katy: Which is to me, feels like, that alone is huge.</p>
                        <p>0:37:26.1 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:37:28.0 Katy: And exactly what we need.</p>
                        <p>0:37:28.0 Michael: Yeah, and there's a lot of accessibility stuff as well for, both for making it easier to run for office and also to make it easier to vote, even stuff about maybe having like... There's... They wanna do a study on being able to vote from your home if you have a significant disability.</p>
                        <p>0:37:46.5 Katy: How would that like...</p>
                        <p>0:37:48.1 Michael: I think that... I think it would be like people would go to their house, I think it's literally...</p>
                        <p>0:37:53.6 Katy: Oh, amazing.</p>
                        <p>0:37:55.6 Peter: Or like the right color smoke out your chimney, like the Pope.</p>
                        <p>0:37:57.8 Michael: I think you make a request online, and then somebody would go to your home and... Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:38:05.4 Katy: Have we looked at the carrier pigeons, because that seems really non-partisan.</p>
                        <p>0:38:10.5 Cody: We'll get the joy on that.</p>
                        <p>0:38:12.8 Michael: So I think what's exciting about this bill too, is that it's not like... It's not coming from the left fringe of the party, it passed the House already with the entire party behind it, it has 49 co-sponsors in the Senate, the entire caucus is sponsoring it, except for Joe Manchin of West Virginia, but...</p>
                        <p>0:38:38.5 Cody: There he is. There's our guy.</p>
                        <p>0:38:40.7 Michael: Before we yell at him...</p>
                        <p>0:38:41.9 Peter: The President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:38:46.5 Michael: I wanna say Manchin co-sponsored a basically identical bill in the last Congress. He's not against, I don't think, any of the provisions in this bill.</p>
                        <p>0:38:56.0 Cody: He just loves the drama.</p>
                        <p>0:38:58.5 Katy: He just wants to keep that position.</p>
                        <p>0:39:00.5 Cody: He lives for the drama.</p>
                        <p>0:39:01.5 Michael: So he released...</p>
                        <p>0:39:02.8 Katy: Which makes me like him much less. I didn't like him at all anyway.</p>
                        <p>0:39:08.5 Michael: He released a statement saying that he thought something like this should be bipartisan, and he outlined what he thought were provisions within the bill that he thinks could garner bipartisan support. And those included 15 days of early voting, it included some Native American voting rights stuff that's in the bill, that's also good, and it included the campaign finance stuff, especially the disclosure that would hit, you know, wealthy donors. That stuff's all very popular.</p>
                        <p>0:39:46.6 Michael: One thing we know is... One reason we know why that stuff is very popular is because we have a leaked recording of Mitch McConnell and legislative aides talking to one of the Kochs, I think it's David Koch, right, back in January about this bill, frustrated with how popular the bill is, and especially how popular the disclosure requirements are [laughter] and they're like, they're going on about how they've been message testing it and everybody loves it, even Republicans love it, and they try to attach stuff to it, they're like, if we put AOC's name on it, it's still popular. If we say it's cancel culture, it's still popular. There're like, we can't... And they are very upset about it, they don't like it at all, and you know, their conclusion was that we're not gonna win this as a public relations battle, we need to win this, they said, "Under the Dome", which means like killing it in committee, killing it with the filibuster, something like that.</p>
                        <p>0:40:53.4 Katy: That's the thing, when you make progress when people... When a new idea takes hold, when progress is made, it's very hard to change it back, because people expect that.</p>
                        <p>0:41:04.2 Michael: Yeah exactly, they're like once this passes it's gonna be hard to undo, for sure, for sure.</p>
                        <p>0:41:09.3 Katy: Yeah, right. Right.</p>
                        <p>0:41:10.9 Michael: What this means for Manchin is like, you know, I think what he's done here is savvy, I really do, because if you compare it to the way Democrats bungled the healthcare negotiations, there they spent months negotiating with individuals about like what they do or don't want in the bill. Instead Manchin's outlined what he thinks a bipartisan compromise should look like it, right? He said these things should have support, here are individual bills about this stuff that had bipartisan co-sponsors, right? And put the ball in the Republicans court and said like, here you go, I'm ready to negotiate with you on a smaller bill, but this is what it should look like and now the onus is on them to come up with 10 or more votes that could pass something like that, which is not gonna happen, because precisely what we were just saying, McConnell and their big money backers hate this stuff and they especially hate the money stuff that Manchin likes.</p>
                        <p>0:42:12.9 Michael: So that's not gonna happen and when that doesn't happen, that's when, you know, he's gonna be put to the question, which is, so what do you wanna do? Do you actually wanna legislate? Do you wanna pass this stuff? 'Cause if you do, you have to reform the filibuster. And he's made good, good noise on that, I think, about not eliminating it, but putting in a talking filibuster, things like that.</p>
                        <p>0:42:36.2 Katy: Let's break that down what that means, 'cause just for people, what a change like that would look like if not eliminating the filibuster together.</p>
                        <p>0:42:44.4 Rhiannon: Before Michael starts, before Michael starts, because he definitely knows, I just want to say, Katy, that while we were prepping for this I, not so jokingly, half-jokingly, was like Peter, Michael, can you guys explain to me what the filibuster is before we go on this show. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:43:07.2 Katy: I'm so glad you did and I'm so glad you shared that, because I've had the fil... I've talked about the Filibuster with people and I have like a general idea, like enough to get by, but I'm not gonna try to break it down for anybody.</p>
                        <p>0:43:20.3 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>0:43:21.0 Cody: So do you feel comfortable explaining it instead of Michael, then?</p>
                        <p>0:43:24.7 Katy: Oh, yeah...</p>
                        <p>0:43:26.4 Rhiannon: No, absolutely not. No, because these losers didn't... Didn't explain it to me, even though I asked.</p>
                        <p>0:43:30.9 Peter: That's because I don't know, Rhiannon, I don't know.</p>
                        <p>0:43:32.5 Katy: Here's the thing. No one's ever read the filibuster law, so it's all [0:43:37.4] ____.</p>
                        <p>0:43:37.6 Peter: No one knows what it is.</p>
                        <p>0:43:39.2 Rhiannon: Except for Michael, except for Michael. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:43:42.0 Peter: What Katy left out of the story of when all of the people on Twitter told you to do a cross-over with us is that it was originally for the impeachment...</p>
                        <p>0:43:50.2 Katy: Yeah, it was.</p>
                        <p>0:43:50.5 Peter: And then you did reach out and we were like, we have no idea what's going on.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:43:55.4 Rhiannon: We cannot talk about that.</p>
                        <p>0:43:58.6 Katy: It's true.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:44:00.4 Katy: It's true. We got a great guest. But I... So yeah, Micheal, all eyes on you.</p>
                        <p>0:44:06.5 Michael: So the thing is, the way the filibuster works right now is, you don't really have to do anything to kill a bill, you can basically call a vote, and as long as you can muster 41 votes against moving forward with debate, the bill is dead. What a talking filibuster does is makes you actually hold the floor if you want to delay a vote, right? And actually debate, right. The idea is like, if you really feel strongly about something, go up there and argue against it and you'll have the floor as long as you want it and if your will is strong enough maybe you'll outlast the sponsors of the bill, maybe they'll say, "You know what, I don't... "</p>
                        <p>0:44:52.4 Peter: Or if your points are good enough, right, if you do a full Mr. Smith goes to Washington, then everyone will...</p>
                        <p>0:44:57.1 Michael: Right. Or you convince people...</p>
                        <p>0:44:57.5 Cody: If you're sweating enough...</p>
                        <p>0:44:57.8 Michael: You can convince people with like your arguments or your conviction or whatever, right? In reality.</p>
                        <p>0:45:06.1 Cody: Or Green Eggs and Ham, whichever one...</p>
                        <p>0:45:07.9 Katy: Or Green and Ham.</p>
                        <p>0:45:10.1 Michael: In reality, that almost never works and it just delays things, right?</p>
                        <p>0:45:13.1 Katy: Well, what it can do is make you look dumb, I think. Getting up there and you're like, you're really killing time and you're not giving any more compelling points, so... Right, right.</p>
                        <p>0:45:22.9 Michael: No. And the incentives for Republicans are entirely different, right? Like it's easy to be one out of 45 Republicans who are voting no on cloture, which is what it's called when you try to break a filibuster. That's like sort of an anonymous thing, right, that you don't have to do anything for. It's quite another thing to be the guy who's sitting up there reading Green Eggs and Ham for seven hours straight because he doesn't like this bill that, you know, Republicans themselves have conceded is wildly popular, right? Like nobody wants to be that guy, the one who's on the news, so it makes it a lot harder individually and as a caucus for them to do any sort of obstruction. They could delay a little bit, but if it becomes a talking filibuster, then this law will be passed, and I think it'll be passed in basically the shape it is now, so that's exciting.</p>
                        <p>0:46:23.6 Peter: And if they do read Doctor Seuss, it won't be Green Eggs and Ham, it'll be yellow racist ones. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:46:30.6 Rhiannon: It will absolutely be.</p>
                        <p>0:46:32.0 Katy: You know, you know that they will. You know that they will.</p>
                        <p>0:46:33.5 Rhiannon: Yeah, oh, absolutely. They're validating.</p>
                        <p>0:46:35.9 Michael: I think it's good, the stuff he's talked about, and one of the reforms he's shown like an openness to is even better, which is like you have to hold 41 votes all the time, so it's not just that one or two people can be in there filibustering, you have to keep your caucus in there. So the entire Republican Party essentially would need to be in the Senate continuously for 10, 12, 24, 48 hours. It's not...</p>
                        <p>0:47:03.0 Cody: But they hate being in session. They don't wanna be there and do stuff.</p>
                        <p>0:47:06.3 Michael: Nothing Senators hate more than being in chambers doing their job, so that is...</p>
                        <p>0:47:12.1 Rhiannon: Yeah, and look, I get it but...</p>
                        <p>0:47:14.8 Michael: Rhi also hates them and [0:47:17.7] ____ doing their jobs.</p>
                        <p>0:47:17.9 Cody: I mean, same but I didn't ask for the job, so...</p>
                        <p>0:47:19.0 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:47:21.0 Katy: Do you think... I mean, you sound hopeful about it, about that, do you think that we would get to that point? Do you think Manchin... Do you think he will get there, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:47:32.7 Michael: Actually, I do. I'm cautiously, cautiously optimistic about it.</p>
                        <p>0:47:38.2 Katy: It's infecting me and I love it!</p>
                        <p>0:47:40.6 Michael: People joke about what they call the "Manchin Cycle," which is where he makes a lot of noise about bipartisanship, criticizes the Democrats, maybe even wants to change a bill, but the end of the cycle is always him voting with a party on important procedural votes. And I think one way to read his statement is just like a prelude to this, so that he can vote to reform the filibuster more in sorrow than in anger sort of thing, right? Like, "Look, I am trying here."</p>
                        <p>0:48:13.1 Cody: Yeah, like, "Look what they made me do. I didn't want to, look, they forced my hand... "</p>
                        <p>0:48:15.0 Michael: Yeah, exactly, "Look, I'm doing my best but you're forcing my hand." Which is very similar to what happened with the stimulus, the COVID stimulus bill, which is like he put together a bipartisan group and they came up with a $600 billion bill, which is like a third of what Biden suggested, and they had one negotiation where it's clear things weren't in good faith and they moved on and that was it. And Manchin voted with the party. He was like, "Alright, that was a waste," so...</p>
                        <p>0:48:50.0 Cody: Yeah, it's like a series of just him constantly learning what it's like to try to work with Republicans.</p>
                        <p>0:48:53.6 Michael: Yes, that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:48:57.5 Cody: Like a gold fish, just constantly having to...</p>
                        <p>0:49:00.2 Michael: But it works for him, so... If we get there... I feel, I do, I feel good about this. I'm feeling optimistic. Maybe I'll have to eat those words, but you know.</p>
                        <p>0:49:09.8 Katy: Maybe.</p>
                        <p>0:49:10.3 Peter: I don't. I don't feel optimistic, but again, I don't know what the filibuster is.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:49:15.1 Katy: I was gonna say, "Please elaborate. I need to be brought back down to earth here," but...</p>
                        <p>0:49:20.5 Rhiannon: It's weird, for my part, I just feel smarter now that I've learned a little bit about the filibuster.</p>
                        <p>0:49:27.1 Katy: I definitely feel smarter. It's strange. What are these feelings of hope?</p>
                        <p>0:49:32.2 Michael: Yeah, I know.</p>
                        <p>0:49:35.3 Katy: I say that jokingly, but it's kind of been hitting me this week. This conversation for sure, but COVID in general and where we're at and it's felt so long, like everything's a dead end.</p>
                        <p>0:49:49.3 Michael: It's sort of counterintuitive about this dynamic where I think it's almost easier for Democrats now with 50 votes than it was when they had 60. When you have 60 votes, it's like you only need one or two and so it feels like, it's like the carrot it's right there, just out of reach and worth going for, but here it's like the Republicans, they need to make a credible offer that they could get 10 or more votes for something. And if they come with 10 people, all it takes is one defector to scuttle it. So it makes it much harder for them to put up a credible argument that they are gonna be good faith negotiators and are gonna come together on a bill that can get 60 votes. It's just a much less persuasive position they're in, so they don't have that sort of... It's like a Kabuki show. And this is one that's just not... That's not the word, but I can't even think of what I'm saying 'cause I'm gonna go a different direction, but it's like a particularly bad Kabuki show here, when they try to say that they're gonna work in a bipartisan way. It's just like, "Alright, that's a fucking joke."</p>
                        <p>0:51:10.3 Cody: Yeah, I know, it's all political theater, that's all they...</p>
                        <p>0:51:14.1 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:51:17.5 Michael: It turns out that having a very slim majority actually just puts a lot more pressure on the Democrats to just vote as a party and get stuff done and so far it seems like they might actually wanna do that, which is weird to say, weird to say.</p>
                        <p>0:51:32.8 Cody: Weird to say, yeah. Well, welcome, but very odd.</p>
                        <p>0:51:37.2 Katy: The words feel foreign in the mouth, but I could adjust to this. Yeah, this has been so informative and very interesting. You guys are awesome. While we have you in there, Cody, you got any questions you can lob at them? You know, Supreme Court questions? "Who's the worst one?" Or I don't know...</p>
                        <p>0:52:00.6 Cody: What is the Supreme Court?</p>
                        <p>0:52:03.6 Katy: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:52:04.3 Cody: I'm kind of curious...</p>
                        <p>0:52:05.2 Rhiannon: I got this guy, I got this one.</p>
                        <p>0:52:07.6 Cody: I'm curious, just like being lawyers, and online, and engaging all this stuff, you're gonna see a lot of very bad faith arguments against certain bills or cases and things like that. And I guess, just generally, is there one that really stands out at you? Like, yesterday, I saw... I'm sure you saw it too. Ben Shapiro was talking about how, like, "Actually, long lines isn't voter suppression. It's like Disney World." That's not ride suppression, it's like, that's just like nonsense and you think about it for more than one second, and you're fine. Like, leave it alone. But is there something like that that you've seen sort of catch fire? I know a lot of... Just in voting, a lot of the Republican talking point is like, "It's not that they don't want people to vote, it's that the Democrats want everyone to vote. They're gonna bring all these people and force them to vote for them." Is there anything like that about HR1 that you think is particularly bad faith?</p>
                        <p>0:53:05.9 Peter: I think that the real thing you learn when you dig into this stuff, is that, the distance between the Ben Shapiros of the world and the John Roberts of the world, is far smaller than you'd think. The Supreme Court jurisprudence on voter suppression is complete vibes work. They're just like, "Well, the states say that there's fraud and we should let 'em... We have to... That's their prerogative." And any peeling back that curtain, and you're just immediately, like, "Well, but there's not." Like, there's tons of objective reality that sort of puts the lie to this, and you'll never get past that.</p>
                        <p>0:53:53.4 Peter: When it comes to stuff like voter suppression, where one side has an incredibly obvious interest in suppressing the vote, and everyone knows what they're doing, and everyone knows that the voter fraud thing is bullshit, no one actually... Especially among the Justices of the Supreme Court, no one actually believes that there is significant voter fraud. And I think the one thing that I've learned from doing the podcast and reading more Supreme Court cases than I have since I was in law school, is that they don't have extra good reasoning. They're not about to blow your mind with their legal reasoning. It's just sort of a slightly more advanced Ben Shapiro and maybe not even that much more advanced. He went to Harvard Law. It's the same basic mind at work there.</p>
                        <p>0:54:45.5 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely. What's the difference between Ben Shapiro saying, "Long lines at the voter polls are like... At voting places, is the same as long lines as at Disneyland." What is the difference between that and John Roberts saying in Shelby County that racism isn't really a problem anymore in voting. There isn't a lot of distance between those things, and so...</p>
                        <p>0:55:07.9 Peter: Also, who thinks that long lines are not a problem at Disneyland?</p>
                        <p>0:55:13.8 Katy: It's a huge problem. It keeps me from Disneyland.</p>
                        <p>0:55:17.9 Cody: They have a specific thing so that you can skip the line, because nobody likes long lines.</p>
                        <p>0:55:21.9 Rhiannon: You can pay $300 and go to the front.</p>
                        <p>0:55:24.0 Michael: I don't know if you've ever been...</p>
                        <p>0:55:25.1 Katy: Also, that's a line for fun.</p>
                        <p>0:55:28.5 Michael: Look, I've been many times, 'cause I grew up in Florida, and every time there were rides, you'd be like, "I wanna go on that," and then you'd look at the line and be like, "Nope."</p>
                        <p>0:55:37.1 Katy: It's a deterrent.</p>
                        <p>0:55:39.2 Cody: Although, I will say that I feel like Ben Shapiro would actually support a law that says that you can pay an extra $300 to skip the voting line.</p>
                        <p>0:55:48.0 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:55:48.2 Cody: He would definitely support something like that.</p>
                        <p>0:55:50.6 Peter: 100%</p>
                        <p>0:55:50.8 Katy: I mean, absolutely, also, if you're gonna make that comparison, keep the polls open till 10:00 like Disneyland, where people get to come later in the day.</p>
                        <p>0:56:00.5 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:56:01.2 Peter: And imagine how bad it would be for Ben Shapiro if you waited for hours to vote, you got to the front, and there was a sign that said you must be this tall.</p>
                        <p>0:56:08.2 Katy: I'm so glad you did that. I was really, really hoping that's where you were going.</p>
                        <p>0:56:13.8 Peter: Well, it didn't quite fit, but I to get it in.</p>
                        <p>0:56:17.3 Katy: No, it did. It was really good.</p>
                        <p>0:56:20.2 Katy: Guys, this has been really, really fun, and I definitely would love to have you back. I feel like I'm on a first date and I'm like, "If that's cool with you, if you ever... "</p>
                        <p>0:56:29.8 Cody: Did it work?</p>
                        <p>0:56:30.5 Katy: Yeah, did you like me? I really liked you. I felt like there was a vibe, but no pressure.</p>
                        <p>0:56:35.5 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:56:37.0 Katy: Yeah, we would really love that. Can you just quickly share where people can find you online, share your Patreon, all that stuff, and we'll link it as well.</p>
                        <p>0:56:45.6 Peter: Yeah, we're on Twitter @FiveFourpod, all spelled out, FiveFourpod, and same place on Patreon, patreon.com/fivefourpod.</p>
                        <p>0:56:53.4 Katy: That's awesome.</p>
                        <p>0:56:54.7 Michael: Thank you so much.</p>
                        <p>0:56:55.5 Rhiannon: Thank you, guys.</p>

                        <p>0:00:01.0 S?: We'll hear argument next in case 09571, Connick v. Thompson. Mr. Duncan.</p>
                        <p>0:00:09.5 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are discussing Connick v. Thompson. In this case, John Thompson was falsely accused of two separate crimes, a high-profile murder and armed robbery. He was convicted of both after the prosecution systematically withheld evidence that could have proven his innocence.</p>
                        <p>0:00:31.2 S?: At the age of 22 I hadn't had a conviction, I hadn't had a real serious record. So the system had to make me out a monster.</p>
                        <p>0:00:38.4 Leon: The prosecution also used a scheduling maneuver to ensure that Thompson would not be able to testify in his own defense.</p>
                        <p>0:00:45.7 S?: I spent 18 years of my life in prison. Fourteen of them was on death row. While on death row, I received seven execution dates.</p>
                        <p>0:00:52.3 Leon: With less than 30 days before Thompson's final execution date, a private investigator discovered evidence that cast doubt on the convictions. Thompson was eventually exonerated and released from prison. He then sued the district attorney for damages and he won, and a jury awarded him $14 million. But then the Supreme Court overturned the jury's decision.</p>
                        <p>0:01:13.6 S?: The prosecutors get away with it, and this is murder, this is attempted murder. If you try to kill a person and you know he is innocent, and you try to think execution dates to murder him, that is attempted murder.</p>
                        <p>0:01:27.7 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:01:33.5 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have left our civil rights weak and emaciated, like a cat on a vegan diet. I am Peter, I'm here with Michael...</p>
                        <p>0:01:47.8 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:49.6 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:50.9 Rhiannon: Hi. Have I ever told you guys about the boss that I had who was a vegetarian and made sure that her dog ate vegetarian?</p>
                        <p>0:01:57.4 Michael: Oh, God.</p>
                        <p>0:01:58.7 Rhiannon: Okay, well, yeah, there's a sad story there.</p>
                        <p>0:02:01.8 Peter: We're risking losing some listeners with that one.</p>
                        <p>0:02:04.4 Rhiannon: Go on. What are we here for today?</p>
                        <p>0:02:06.3 Peter: Well, today's case is Connick v. Thompson, but before we get into the case, I think we need to talk current events...</p>
                        <p>0:02:13.5 Rhiannon: Yeah, there's some really hot stuff.</p>
                        <p>0:02:15.8 Peter: There is. Now, we're, look, a little bit, a couple of weeks behind the ball here, but a couple of weeks ago, there was a Georgetown professor, Sandra Sellers, who was terminated for doing racism on a Zoom chat, talked about the relative performance of her black students in a way that some people would think was not the best way to talk about it, you know?</p>
                        <p>0:02:41.1 Rhiannon: Sure, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:02:41.1 Peter: And another Professor, David Batson, was there, just sort of nodding along, and this resulted in the Georgetown administration finding out, firing Professor Sellers, and I think Batson either stepped down or was told to resign shortly thereafter. Now, many of our listeners, if you're tuned in the legal world, might have heard about that. What you might not have heard is that we did it, we're actually the ones who did it. A Georgetown student in our Slack posted the video of the racism happening. He said, yeah, some Georgetown students are discussing this. And we made a coordinated effort to boost it and the next day, heads were rolling. Blood was spilled. So I just want to take this time to, first of all, stand in awe of our collective power and celebrate the enormity of what we've achieved.</p>
                        <p>0:03:36.0 Peter: If you had told me a year ago when we started this podcast that we were getting professors fired, I would say that's all I ever wanted to do.</p>
                        <p>0:03:45.9 Rhiannon: Right, right, but it still seemed like a very distant sort of goal. Like yeah, that sounds great, but that's not possible.</p>
                        <p>0:03:53.2 Peter: And now it feels like we're just beginning, and our goal and our promise to you, our listeners, is that we'll get them all fired.</p>
                        <p>0:04:02.0 Rhiannon: We will not rest until legal academia has been laid to waste.</p>
                        <p>0:04:08.8 Peter: Yeah, and if you want to join our effort, join our Patreon at the arch enemy tier, which gives you access to our Slack where we will together conspire to have your professors fired. Patreon.com/fivefourpod.</p>
                        <p>0:04:25.8 Michael: You too can do this service for your country.</p>
                        <p>0:04:31.0 Peter: Anyway, today's case like I said, like I said, is Connick v. Thompson. This is a case about prosecutors...</p>
                        <p>0:04:38.3 Rhiannon: Boo!</p>
                        <p>0:04:41.4 Michael: If you follow the law at all, you've probably heard stories of prosecutors abusing their position, withholding or ignoring exculpatory evidence, introducing false or questionable evidence, discriminating in prosecution or jury selection, on and on and on and on. And perhaps you've asked yourself or others, what can be done about such shenanigans. Are prosecutors ever held responsible for this sort of misconduct or, alternatively, are they insulated from repercussions because they are not, as they claim, representatives of the people, but rather an indirectly militarized arm of the carceral state. Stay tuned and find out.</p>
                        <p>0:05:22.6 Michael: Yay. Getting pumped.</p>
                        <p>0:05:25.4 Peter: In this case, a 22-year-old black man named John Thompson was falsely convicted of armed robbery based on manipulated evidence. But it gets worse, the only reason prosecutors brought that case against him at all was to use it as leverage in another case, a murder that they were hoping to pin on him. They successfully leveraged the false armed robbery conviction to help convict him on the murder charge. He was sentenced to death and served nearly 20 years in prison before all of this finally leads to his convictions being overturned after it is uncovered. And he sues, he sues the prosecutor's office for its misconduct and he wins $14 million, but then the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision by our good buddy Clarence Thomas reverses the judgment, saying that the prosecutors cannot be held liable for their misconduct in this context. Rhi, let's go.</p>
                        <p>0:06:22.7 Rhiannon: Do I have a story for you all today. Yeah. This is a story about how the criminal punishment system really works by design, and how the Court does nothing to hold it accountable for the violence that it does. In 1984, John Thompson was 22 years old and living in New Orleans, Louisiana. In late 1984, a man named Raymond Liuzza Jr was shot and killed. One witness saw that shooting and told police that the shooter was a black man, six feet tall with close-cut hair.</p>
                        <p>0:06:57.4 Peter: Open and shut case, Johnson, we got him.</p>
                        <p>0:07:00.3 Rhiannon: Now, John Thompson at this time is 5 feet 8 inches tall and has a large afro. Yeah, it's bad. But John Thompson is the one who gets convicted of this murder and sentenced to death.</p>
                        <p>0:07:18.4 Peter: Well, he is black, though, that's one for three.</p>
                        <p>0:07:20.0 Michael: That's... There's not much else you need.</p>
                        <p>0:07:22.4 Rhiannon: Do keep that in mind over the course of the story. So this is not just a story about the criminal punishment system and about the Supreme Court, it's specifically John Thompson's story and a story about how the DA's office in New Orleans engineered first a life sentence and then a death sentence for him. So a quick note, in stories about exculpatory evidence being hidden or withheld by prosecutors, you will often hear that evidence referred to as Brady evidence or Brady material, sometimes even just Brady, like they didn't turn over Brady, for example. That's because there was a Supreme Court case called Brady v. Maryland, and it's a foundational cornerstone decision in the Law of Criminal Procedure that says that any evidence that might exonerate a defendant must be turned over to the defense.</p>
                        <p>0:08:12.9 Peter: I'm glad we needed a whole Supreme Court case to say this, right. If you find evidence that proves that this guy is innocent, you do have to hand it over.</p>
                        <p>0:08:21.9 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:08:22.3 Michael: You can still go forward with the prosecution.</p>
                        <p>0:08:25.6 Rhiannon: That's right, yeah. The Brady decision stands for the idea that it's a violation of your right to due process if you're not afforded the opportunity to see not just the evidence that shows you're guilty, but also evidence that might show that you're innocent, right. You can pick apart evidence that shows you're guilty, but you also have the right to inspect and present and build on exculpatory evidence too. And the reason why prosecutors are required to turn this over is how would, say, a poor defendant in court have this evidence, right, the prosecutor as a representative of the state is the one with the power and control over the investigation of all of these crimes and the collection of all of this evidence.</p>
                        <p>0:09:01.6 Michael: The crime scenes are sealed, all the evidences in the state's hands, there's no real way to get at it otherwise.</p>
                        <p>0:09:07.1 Rhiannon: That's right. So turning back to John Thompson's story. So police and prosecutors in Orleans Parish begin investigating this murder in late 1984. They have the description from the witness that the shooter is six feet tall, a black man with close-cut hair. A few weeks after the murder in a separate incident, an armed robbery occurs of three siblings. The perpetrator of the robbery held these kids at gunpoint and during the struggle, the perpetrator's blood stained one of the kids' pant legs. Now, that swatch of fabric with the suspect's blood stain on it was saved and stored by law enforcement in Orleans Parish/</p>
                        <p>0:09:45.9 Michael: Props, by the way, to those kids to draw some blood, man.</p>
                        <p>0:09:49.7 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, they put up a fight, yeah. So police and prosecutors are investigating both of these crimes, the murder and an armed robbery, and this is where shady shit starts happening. So first, after the murder victim's family announces a cash reward for information, a really shady witness comes to the family and tells them that John Thompson and another man, Kevin Freeman, had been involved in the murder. The family and the shady witness go to police afterwards and they give this information, and the shady witness says that he heard about all of this, he heard about Thompson and Freeman's involvement in the murder from Freeman.</p>
                        <p>0:10:27.3 Rhiannon: Now, important side note here, Kevin Freeman is six feet tall and wore his hair in a close-cut style that made his scalp visible.</p>
                        <p>0:10:39.4 Michael: Interesting.</p>
                        <p>0:10:39.7 Rhiannon: Yeah, keep that in mind. John Thompson and Kevin Freeman are subsequently arrested for the murder based on this shady witness' report to the police. Now, you've seen prosecutors would move forward on the murder case against Freeman since he fits the eyewitness description, unlike John Thompson, but something else happens kind of at the same time. When Thompson and Freeman are arrested for the murder, their pictures are published in the newspaper. So the father of the kids who were robbed in that separate incident shows the kids the picture of John Thompson with his afro, and the father reports to police that the kids identified John Thompson in the picture as the guy who robbed them. Later, there is an extremely problematic photo lineup shown to the kids in which that same photo of Thompson from the newspaper was included, and the kids again say that Thompson robbed them.</p>
                        <p>0:11:31.1 Michael: Here's the photo you identified before. Do you still identify it?</p>
                        <p>0:11:35.7 Rhiannon: Exactly. If you know anything about photo lineups and police practices...</p>
                        <p>0:11:40.6 Peter: Or just basic human psychology.</p>
                        <p>0:11:43.1 Rhiannon: Exactly, you know that confirmation bias is a real problem in photo identification of crime suspects. So Mr. Thompson is already in jail for the murder, you'll remember, along with Kevin Freeman, and now prosecutors are able to pin this robbery on him based on the kids saying John Thompson is the one who robbed us. Now, at this point, Orleans Parish prosecutors make a pretty gross strategic decision, it's gross, but it is common. Even though the robbery happened after the murder, the DA's office decides to try Mr. Thompson for the robbery first, so they can leverage the robbery conviction against him during the murder trial.</p>
                        <p>0:12:21.6 Rhiannon: So let's talk about what happens at the robbery trial first. Even though Mr. Thompson's lawyers requested access to all Brady material, all potentially exculpatory evidence, which would have included that swatch of fabric with the robber's blood on it, prosecutors blocked their review of that evidence, and in fact, the swatch with the blood evidence on it was signed out of the property room over at the DA's office...</p>
                        <p>0:12:45.2 Peter: Which is the evidence room, by the way.</p>
                        <p>0:12:47.6 Rhiannon: Yeah, the evidence room, the evidence storage room, and it wasn't returned until the day before trial. So when Mr. Thompson's lawyers were given access to inspect all of the evidence, there wasn't any blood evidence there, and the prosecutors didn't tell defense that blood evidence existed at all, so the defense lawyers didn't know anything was missing. This is super, super important because prosecutors had ordered testing to be done on that blood evidence, and the analysis came back saying that the blood definitively was from a person with blood type B. The perpetrator of the robbery therefore had blood type B, right. John Thompson's blood type is O.</p>
                        <p>0:13:27.1 Rhiannon: This is a multi-layered violation of Brady, right. Prosecutors first did not disclose the existence of potentially exculpatory evidence, and then after they didn't disclose the test results, which were also exculpatory, right, so at the trial for robbery, the prosecutors didn't present the blood evidence, of course, they wouldn't, it negates their case. And in fact, after it was checked out of the property room, the swatch has never been found to this day, so this means that at trial, the only evidence against Mr. Thompson that was presented was the testimony of the children who had been robbed. Based solely on those descriptions, Mr. Thompson was convicted of attempted armed robbery and the judge sentenced him to 49 years in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
                        <p>0:14:12.2 Rhiannon: So now, armed with the robbery conviction and what is a de facto life sentence against Mr. Thompson, right, 50 years in prison...</p>
                        <p>0:14:20.3 Michael: For a 22-year-old, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:14:22.2 Rhiannon: Even in your early 20s is a life sentence. Prosecutors have a massive advantage in prosecuting him for the murder, so by prosecuting Mr. Thompson for the robbery first, they effectively took away Mr. Thompson's ability to testify in his own defense at the murder trial, because the only way that the jury would have heard that Mr. Thompson was already convicted of another violent crime, of robbery, already had this very scary-looking rap sheet, would be if Mr. Thompson took the stand. Prosecutors would then be allowed to bring up the robbery conviction to undermine Mr. Thompson's credibility, so effectively, again, in kind of this de facto way, they've taken away his right to testify in his own defense, and they added on top of that at least three more Brady violations in order to put the nail in the coffin of Mr. Thompson's murder trial.</p>
                        <p>0:15:13.9 Rhiannon: So first, prosecutors did not disclose at the murder trial that they had recordings of the conversation of that shady witness when he spoke to the murder victim's family, and in that conversation, the shady witness had implied heavily that he was giving this information, kind of coming up with this information, only in return for the cash reward. The shady witness testified against Mr. Thompson at the murder trial, and he testified on the stand that he gave that information to the police with no knowledge of the reward money. That is false. Mr. Thompson's attorneys, though, did not have those recordings of those conversations, so they couldn't show that the shady witness was lying.</p>
                        <p>0:15:53.0 Rhiannon: Second, the prosecutors had flipped the co-suspect, that Kevin Freeman guy, so that Freeman was testifying against Mr. Thompson in that murder trial. Prosecutors didn't turn over the police report that said that the shady witness had heard about the murder from Kevin Freeman, so the defense couldn't attack Freeman's credibility on the stand by asking him questions about his prior statements he'd made about his own involvement in the murder.</p>
                        <p>0:16:21.3 Rhiannon: And third, people are maybe yelling at their headphones or whatever about this, if you remember what I said earlier, there was an eye witness to that murder, right, the eye witness gave a description of the shooter, six feet tall, a black man with close-cut hair. Prosecutors did not turn over information about that eye witness or that description, so Mr. Thompson and his lawyers had no idea that there was an eye witness description and that the description did not match Mr. Thompson at all, who again was 5 foot 8 with an afro. Defense attorneys here were really running blind and it was through no fault of their own, like with no evidence with which to attack the prosecutor's case, Mr. Thompson was found guilty of first degree murder.</p>
                        <p>0:17:04.4 Michael: Right, right. And usually the district attorneys leave this sort of stuff to their little underlings to do the prosecutions, but in this case, District Attorney Harry Connick wanted to be really involved, he handpicked the team, he was in the day-to-day stuff. You know, if we're gonna violate Brady, we better do it right. So he was like in it.</p>
                        <p>0:17:29.5 Peter: Yeah, and if that name sounds familiar to you, Harry Connick, that's because the criminal DA Harry Connick is the father of Harry Connick Jr, American celebrity. He's like a singer, he's an actor, he's been on American Idol briefly, he was the fighter pilot friend of Will Smith in Independence Day, if you remember, that guy. He said famously, let's kick the tires and light the fires, Big Daddy, to Will Smith, especially famous to people who have watched Independence Day 75 times.</p>
                        <p>0:18:07.4 Michael: Didn't quite make the same singer to actor leap that Will did, though.</p>
                        <p>0:18:12.1 Peter: And maybe more pertinently, for the past decade or so, has been an ADA on Law and Order Special Victims Unit.</p>
                        <p>0:18:20.6 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>0:18:24.2 Rhiannon: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>0:18:25.5 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:18:26.2 Rhiannon: Are the Special Victims victims of the prosecutor's office who are framed for murder?</p>
                        <p>0:18:33.1 Michael: Law and Order loves doing the... Like ripped from the headlines and they should do this case, they should make Harry Connick Jr play the corrupt district attorney who destroys evidence, wouldn't that be good.</p>
                        <p>0:18:48.2 Rhiannon: So at the punishment phase of the trial, the DA's office argued that because Mr. Thompson was already serving a decades-long sentence for attempted armed robbery, the only way to punish him for murder was to execute him. They got what they wanted, he was sentenced to death and he was transferred to death row in 1985. So some nine years later, one of the prosecutors after learning that he was terminally ill, confessed to another prosecutor friend that he had suppressed the blood evidence in the robbery case against Mr. Thompson. Now, nothing really happened, though, until five years after that, in 1999, when the State of Louisiana scheduled Mr. Thompson for execution. Mr. Thompson's lawyers hired a private investigator to try and find anything they could that would save Mr. Thompson's life and deep down in the state's forensic archives, lo and behold, the investigator found a microfiche copy of the lab report that identified the robber's blood type.</p>
                        <p>0:19:48.9 Rhiannon: So at that point, the prosecutor friend who knew that the robbery prosecutor had withheld that evidence, he's...</p>
                        <p>0:19:55.2 Peter: Yeah, he's like, you know what, I found some information as well in the last five years. His friend did a deathbed confession, basically liked I killed someone. And he was just like...</p>
                        <p>0:20:05.6 Michael: I guess I gotta sit with that.</p>
                        <p>0:20:09.4 Peter: That's so nuts, dude.</p>
                        <p>0:20:11.6 Michael: Thanks for laying that on my shoulders, bud.</p>
                        <p>0:20:13.7 Rhiannon: Right, yeah. So the prosecutor friend who knew that the robbery prosecutor had withheld that evidence finally came out and signed an affidavit saying his friend had admitted to doing this, and Mr. Thompson's robbery conviction as a result was overturned and the execution was stayed. But important to note that the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office fought this every step of the way, but eventually the Louisiana court of appeals also reversed Mr. Thompson's murder conviction. Now, what did the district attorney's office do? They didn't say like, oh, yeah, that's right, we fucked up and this guy can go free now. The DA's office in Orleans Parish again tried Mr. Thompson for murder.</p>
                        <p>0:20:58.0 Rhiannon: This time, the Brady evidence was disclosed to defense attorneys and a jury took 35 minutes to find that Mr. Thompson was not guilty. So after 18 years in prison, 14 of them in solitary on death row, Mr. Thompson is released and he sues the district attorney's office in Orleans Parish, saying that they had violated his civil rights by not properly training prosecutors about the requirements of Brady. Now, for this to work legally, a plaintiff has to show that the failure to train amounts to a pattern of people's rights being violated, and the legal standard is a pattern that leads to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom an untrained employee comes into contact.</p>
                        <p>0:21:43.4 Rhiannon: Now, Mr. Thompson takes that lawsuit to trial, the jury hears all of the evidence about what the DA's office did to Mr. Thompson and they agree that there was deliberate indifference to the rights of Mr. Thompson and awarded him $14 million. Now, that's what we're talking about here, that's sort of the liability of the District Attorney's Office, and that's what gets appealed first to the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed the jury holding, which is wild in an extremely conservative Fifth Circuit federal appellate court and the DA's office in New Orleans appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:22:23.8 Michael: I'm excited, guys, this could be our first good decision, right? A unanimous court.</p>
                        <p>0:22:34.7 Peter: So alright, let's talk about the law a little bit.</p>
                        <p>0:22:37.3 Michael: Before we do, really quick, sorry. If you are sitting there thinking like, why are we talking about training, why are we talking about deliberate indifference, this was intentional and malicious, that's a different case that we will no doubt cover at some point in the future. So get ready for that.</p>
                        <p>0:22:56.9 Peter: Okay, so let's talk about the law a little bit here. The question the Court is addressing, if you take a step back, is basically how bad does a prosecutor's misconduct have to be before they can be held legally liable. And this is a big question under the law, because prosecutors, similar to police, are afforded certain protections and immunities. And the idea behind that, if I'm being as favorable to it as possible, is that inevitably in the course of prosecution mistakes will be made, and if they become liable for every single one, it makes their job just sort of impossibly difficult. So we need to protect them. And again, like Rhi mentioned, the rule is that there must be a pattern of misconduct.</p>
                        <p>0:23:42.1 Peter: And so Clarence Thomas, in his decision, his basic argument is simple, he says, look, you know, if one prosecutor does something shady, you can go after them individually, but if you want to go after the entire office, you need to show this system of inadequate training, right, the pattern of misconduct. It can't be just one incident because one incident isn't enough information to conclude that there is inadequate training. And Thomas says that this is just one incident, so the government can't be held responsible here. And the problem with this, which the dissent points out, is this wasn't one incident, it was one conspiracy, I think you could look at it like that. In the literal legal sense, it was one conspiracy, but in the course of the story, a team of prosecutors, including the District Attorney himself, suppressed critical evidence in one case in order to leverage it in another, kept that evidence suppressed, not just during the trial, but for the subsequent nearly 20 years, until someone finally found out right before the state killed John Thompson, or would have killed John Thompson.</p>
                        <p>0:24:52.3 Peter: They didn't turn the blood report results over to the defense when they were compelled to by motion, they blocked inspection of the blood by the defense, they removed it from the evidence room completely the week before trial, they didn't introduce the blood as evidence at the trial, of course, and in fact, as Rhi mentioned, it has never been found, which almost certainly means it was destroyed. They offered witness testimony they knew was false, they withheld witness testimony about the murderer's description that would have exculpated Thompson. How is that not a pattern of misconduct? In what world is that a single incident? If a single prosecutor did something to cover up one bit of evidence in a case, and that was all he did, I think you can make the argument that it's sort of an isolated occurrence, but this is a coordinated effort by a team of prosecutors that spans multiple cases, and depending on how you look at it, multiple decades.</p>
                        <p>0:25:45.6 Peter: It requires multiple people to work together in an extensive effort to cover up evidence. You'd have to be an absolute fucking idiot to think that this is a single occurrence of misconduct, and honestly, I don't think that Clarence Thomas does. His opinion, which he admits relies very heavily on precedent, and that's when you know Thomas is being disingenuous 'cause he barely believes in precedent as a concept.</p>
                        <p>0:26:12.4 Rhiannon: He doesn't even like precedent.</p>
                        <p>0:26:14.2 Michael: He loves writing these concurrence where he's like, my colleagues have correctly applied precedent, and so I concur in judgment, but if I'm being honest, if I got to make the decisions, we would throw that precedent out. That's like his calling card.</p>
                        <p>0:26:28.3 Peter: Exactly. His opinion is almost completely devoid of any thoughtful analysis of the actual case, like how it impacts people and how it impacted Mr. Thompson, to a point where a lot of legal commentators found it particularly cold, and when legal commentators find something particularly cold, you fucked up, you've done something egregious.</p>
                        <p>0:26:48.8 Rhiannon: Right. When those fucking robots have any semblance of an emotion.</p>
                        <p>0:26:54.2 Peter: You've got a situation where a man was framed and as a result sentenced to death, and the majority opinion finds that the conduct was not pervasive enough to warrant liability. I mean, the only thing that explains this in my mind is the conservatives on the Court truly do not conceptualize criminal defendants in these cases as human beings. I don't think there's anything else that actually explains this case, and I know that sounds dramatic, but I just... I can't think of any... I try to think in terms of the conservative mind and the conservative psychology, how it gets to a conclusion like this, and there are little things here and there that can explain Thomas's reasoning, the focus on rules, things like that. But I really don't think that there's anything that explains it better, than they don't think of this person as a human.</p>
                        <p>0:27:40.0 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:27:40.6 Michael: I think that's right, and I think you can see it in just the way Thomas's opinion... It's sort of deceptively simple, but he's very clearly like running cover for the prosecutor here, right. You could find clear instances of bad faith, and the one that really jumped out to me was how he says, this is only one incident. This is only one incident. It's not a pattern. Thompson points out that during the 10 years preceding armed robbery trial, Louisiana courts had overturned for other convictions in the same office because of Grady violations. That sounds like a pattern, right? And Thomas says, well, no, because they weren't similar to the Brady violation here, they didn't involve blood evidence and lab reports, which is like... What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
                        <p>0:28:29.5 Rhiannon: It's horrific.</p>
                        <p>0:28:30.4 Peter: Just think about this in the most basic sense. If you had a child, like a seven-year-old child, and your child punches his sister and then lies about it, right. And then lies about stealing something. Is that a pattern of lies? You wouldn't be like, well, those are different, those are different types of lies.</p>
                        <p>0:28:47.1 Rhiannon: Right, exactly, exactly. Yes, it's just the conservative tendency to sort of specify to a point of total abstraction that doesn't even make sense.</p>
                        <p>0:28:57.8 Peter: Technicality for the sake of technicality.</p>
                        <p>0:29:00.6 Michael: I don't think Thomas is confused here, right, like the point he's making makes sense in the abstract, which is like, look, if they keep fucking up blood evidence, then clearly they don't understand what is and isn't exculpatory blood evidence and you need to train them about it. But that's not the concern animating this, right, that's not the claim being raised here. The claim being raised here is that this office doesn't take Brady seriously, and the training they need is you have to fucking turn over Brady materials, you're not idiots, you know what's exculpatory, and you have to do it. It's not a suggestion, right. That's the training.</p>
                        <p>0:29:34.7 Peter: It's not like they thought like, oh, blood evidence, you gotta hand over blood evidence too?</p>
                        <p>0:29:40.7 Michael: What? So like, and Thomas knows this, gets this, right. This is deliberate. This is the way conservatives launder their opinions. This is a perfect example of them viewing themselves as advocates for the police, right. Prosecutors are cops, and they're advocates for the police, and they're making sure the police can do their jobs as they see it, both the cops and the conservatives, which is maintaining order, maintaining the current social order, and if you have to fucking break a few civil rights eggs in order to do that, if you have to frame a few people for murder and sentence them to death, if that's what it takes to keep the fucking rabble down, that's what it is. The state is fucking bullshit. It's disgusting. That's what this is.</p>
                        <p>0:30:32.5 Rhiannon: And stepping back a little bit, talking about what prosecutors are sort of bound and required to do when prosecuting, it's not just that Brady v. Maryland created the standard that requires prosecutors to turn over this evidence, prosecutors' ethical duty in the law in their profession is to justice, their duty is not solely to collect convictions or to gain convictions, their ethical duty is to the truth and to justice.</p>
                        <p>0:30:58.7 Peter: Right. Lawyers can't put people on the stand they know are going to lie, things like that, right.</p>
                        <p>0:31:03.2 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. And so I think what Thomas fails to do is sort of honor and uphold the important mission of what in theory a prosecutor should be doing, right, and just gives carte blanche to continue to do this shit because, oh, it's just kind of like an occupational hazard, sorry.</p>
                        <p>0:31:21.3 Michael: And so Thomas does talk about this and he sort of uses it in this bad faith way, he says, look, like it's not just trainings in the office that district attorneys rely upon to make sure their subordinates are complying with the law, they take professional ethics in law school, they are apprenticed, they have to take continuing legal education to maintain their Bar membership and so Thomas is saying, look, the district attorney can rely on that in assuming that his assistant district attorneys are not corrupt and know what they're doing, and so they need some reason to think there needs to be a training, right, like you need to demonstrate as a plaintiff that there was some glaring issue. But I think any time there's a Brady violation, any time, even one, there should be a big office-wide training.</p>
                        <p>0:32:21.2 Michael: I don't think you should wait until there are five or six, I don't think you should need three or four blood evidence Brady violations before like, let's have a blood evidence training. It's a serious issue.</p>
                        <p>0:32:33.8 Rhiannon: Right, it's a serious miscarriage of justice already.</p>
                        <p>0:32:36.8 Michael: It's a constitutional violation.</p>
                        <p>0:32:39.7 Rhiannon: Right, right. You have fundamentally fucked up on the job.</p>
                        <p>0:32:42.0 Peter: That would be the case at any normal workplace. If there's a really overt case of sexual harassment at a normal workplace, they're not like, alright, guys, you only got two more strikes, then we're doing a training.</p>
                        <p>0:32:51.3 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:32:52.2 Peter: Everyone gets a fucking training.</p>
                        <p>0:32:55.5 Michael: And they've been getting convictions overturned for Brady violations, like every 30 months or something, that's like...</p>
                        <p>0:33:01.3 Rhiannon: Right. This is clearly a problem.</p>
                        <p>0:33:03.0 Peter: It's the 25 strike rule that they operate by now. Alright, let's take a quick break and then we will move on to Antonin Scalia.</p>
                        <p>0:33:15.7 Rhiannon: Hey everybody, thank you so much for listening to 5-4. If you are already a Patreon subscriber, thank you so much. Thank you extra. I would love to open mouth kiss each and every one of you. We actually have a special event coming up for Patreon subscribers. Boys, tell them what it's about.</p>
                        <p>0:33:38.0 Peter: Yeah, it's about legal media and why it's so awful, and all of the various brain disorders that people in legal journalism have, we're gonna explain them, we're gonna run right through the DSM and catalog all of their various conditions.</p>
                        <p>0:33:51.6 Michael: We're gonna name names.</p>
                        <p>0:33:54.2 Peter: That's this Friday, April 2nd, 9 PM Eastern.</p>
                        <p>0:33:58.6 Michael: Yeah, so if you're not a subscriber yet, subscribe to the $10 tier and you can hop on that Zoom with us.</p>
                        <p>0:34:06.1 Rhiannon: Patreon.com/fivefourpod, all spelled out.</p>
                        <p>0:34:10.6 Peter: Alright, we're back. I think we should talk maybe for a second about Anton Scalia's concurrence. In the past, we've talked about a style of concurrence pioneered by Brett Kavanaugh, which is the concurrence that doesn't need to exist, but the author is not self-aware enough to realize that.</p>
                        <p>0:34:30.5 Rhiannon: That's right, yeah, just repeating exactly what the majority just said.</p>
                        <p>0:34:34.2 Michael: It's like the legal version of that meme of the drunk guy at the bar, like talking into that girl's ear, you know what I'm talking about?</p>
                        <p>0:34:42.2 Rhiannon: Yes, exactly. And the girl's face is like, God, please kill me, just take me now.</p>
                        <p>0:34:46.5 Peter: Yeah, but it's about the non-delegation doctrine. So most concurrence are where a Justice is basically like, there's this other point that's unaddressed here. I agree with the conclusion, but I want to address this point. Then you've got the Kavanaugh variation, there's the classic Clarence Thomas, which is like, I agree with the conclusion based on our precedent, but I would overturn everything. And then you have the Scalia concurrence here is, is what I call the I could do this better concurrence. Which is when you're making the same points as the majority, not like Kavanaugh because you don't realize it, but because he read the Thomas majority, he read Ginsburg dissent, which is very strong and really takes the majority to the mats...</p>
                        <p>0:35:36.6 Michael: Like takes them out to the woodshed.</p>
                        <p>0:35:40.0 Peter: I mean, you read the Ginsburg dissent and you're like, that's the winning side of this argument, it's just one of those things. And I think Scalia saw that and was like, okay, I could do this better than Thomas. And he just sort of gave it a whirl. I don't think it adds much substantively, I don't know if there's anything you guys want to discuss about it, but I just... I did want to flag a new type of concurrence.</p>
                        <p>0:35:58.4 Michael: A new concurrence just dropped.</p>
                        <p>0:36:02.3 Peter: Added to the canon.</p>
                        <p>0:36:02.3 Rhiannon: Scalia not wanting anybody else to take credit for whatever bullshit they're talking about today.</p>
                        <p>0:36:07.5 Michael: The one thing I'll say is that he gets a lot of credit for being the big brain, right, and I don't think he is. With that being said, it's like you said, he saw that Ginsburg was really... Out-classed Thomas, because Ginsburg is right and Thomas is basically just running interference for a cover up. And he's like, well, I could do this, but he can't. They're wrong. There's no way about it, like you say, there are no objective answers, but this is about as close as you get to there being a clear answer, and five Justices were on the wrong side of it. There's no getting out of that.</p>
                        <p>0:36:40.5 Peter: Exactly. So when we discussed qualified immunity with respect to the police last year, we talked a little bit about a discrepancy between how police talk about themselves and how they demand the law treat them, and it's a similar dynamic with prosecutors, who hold themselves out as sort of the vessel through which the people's justice flows, right? They often show up at public interest fairs at law school as if they're in the business of serving the common good, which I found particularly offensive as a sell-out, 'cause I was like, at least I'm admitting it, just if you go for... If you go to a corporate law firm, no one's pretending that they're serving the public interest, right.</p>
                        <p>0:37:22.8 Peter: The prosecutors are like, oh no, I think this helps everyone. It's offensive to all sell-outs, I think. Yeah, so they're holding themselves out as the carriers of this great social responsibility, and yet there is this vast legal framework specifically designed to insulate them from the consequences of abusing or neglecting that responsibility, right? Is it really a responsibility? And if there are no consequences for fucking up, isn't the fact that there must be consequences for messing up central to the entire concept of responsibility? Like that's how you teach it to children, right? This is a responsibility, Timmy, that means don't fuck it up or you get in trouble.</p>
                        <p>0:38:02.4 Michael: The whole idea of somebody who's responsible is somebody who gets it right, does what they need to do it even when it's difficult. Oh, they're very responsible, they stayed up late to get their work done or whatever, blah, blah, blah.</p>
                        <p>0:38:17.2 Peter: Regular people are not given the freedom to make dire mistakes, this is a luxury that the state affords itself. They're like, oh, this is a really tough job we've got here, and sometimes we will, yes, engage in conspiracies to get a man sentenced to death. That's just part of what we do. You wouldn't really understand. In reality, if we wanted to impute the prosecutorial role with the appropriate level of responsibility, there would be extensive oversight and penalties for things like the purposeful obstruction of evidence.</p>
                        <p>0:38:49.3 Peter: Instead, we have a system built around protecting prosecutors, and it's even more bizarre here than it is in many police cases. Like with police, you have this idea that they're making split second, high-stakes decisions that will naturally lead to some mistakes, and so they need some leeway, right? And obviously, the police have long abused that leeway, but at least it makes some conceptual sense, right. Here we have some fucking slobs who if they weren't prosecutors would be like slip and fall scam artists who just sat at their desks in between sandwich runs plotting out a fraud to get a man sentenced to death for years on end. That's not the heat of the moment, that's close to the opposite of that.</p>
                        <p>0:39:31.4 Michael: It's not a slip, right, that's not you overslept your alarm. I said this earlier, but it's like prosecutors or cops, I don't know if it's true everywhere else, but here in New York, they can even get little badges if they want.</p>
                        <p>0:39:45.3 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, they have badges.</p>
                        <p>0:39:47.6 Peter: And you know they all get them.</p>
                        <p>0:39:49.1 Michael: Yeah, they do.</p>
                        <p>0:39:50.0 Rhiannon: They absolutely have badges, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:39:51.9 Michael: So I think the Court gets that the same way they need to insulate cops from responsibility, they need to insulate prosecutors as well, it's all part of this same overarching ideology, which is that the state gets to trample the rights of the underclass is really what this is about, it's like maintaining the social order, and the social order is that poor people and black people are under the boot.</p>
                        <p>0:40:20.2 Peter: Absolutely. I do have one thought before we just let Rhi run wild here, which I'm excited for. It's important to understand just how fundamentally flawed our prosecutorial system is. When someone with like, let's say with the last name Johnson is being prosecuted, the cases are literally titled State v. Johnson, or even worse, The People v. Johnson. The prosecutors supposedly represent the state, but why does the state necessarily want to convict someone? Shouldn't the state be neutral? If the purpose of the proceedings is to determine the actual truth of what happened, doesn't a public defender represent the interests of the state and the people as well? And if you want to really peel back the absurdity of this construction even further, if the prosecution is the state, then what the fuck is the judge?</p>
                        <p>0:41:08.3 Rhiannon: Right, right. What's he doing?</p>
                        <p>0:41:09.2 Peter: The state is represented twice. What the fuck? In America, we have what's called an adversarial legal system. One side's lawyers are tasked with arguing that the accused is guilty, and the other side that the accused is not. Neither side is interested in the truth per se, they are obligated by legal ethics rules to argue for their side. Now, obviously, they're not supposed to lie or obscure the truth in the process, but the system creates these dangerous perverse incentives, which this case very clearly lays bare, right, and it also creates this scenario where the state, which should be neutral to the outcome, is invested in sending a person to prison or to their death.</p>
                        <p>0:41:51.3 Peter: And it's not pie in the sky idealism to think that this shouldn't be our system. There are Western nations with what's called inquisitorial systems, where the judge is assigned without relying in full on advocacy from the parties to make a determination about the truth, like what actually happened here. Naturally, that's not a flawless system, but it does seem to be one that is at least ostensibly geared towards finding the truth, and that would be a big inherent improvement on this sort of farcical system we have today where the government is overtly taking on the role of, we want to send this guy to prison, essentially, regardless of whether or not they're guilty.</p>
                        <p>0:42:28.2 Peter: Obviously, in an inquisitorial system, there might be judges who are corrupt or biased or whatever, and that's always gonna be a downside, a downside in our system with judges as well, but you will not have the disgusting incentives that led to these people manufacturing a case against this man to send them to his death.</p>
                        <p>0:42:48.0 Michael: Right, the whole idea with zealous advocacy is you're supposed to push things to the limit, which means the state is literally in the posture of trying to bend or even break the very rules that are in place to ensure a fair trial and ostensibly at least make sure that the truth comes out, right, which is not a position the state should be in. You've really fucked things up if that's where you've landed. Another point I want to make is like that Peter said, the judge represents the state, the prosecutors represent the state, and in I think any reasonable conception, the federal defenders or the public defenders would be representatives of the people as well. But philosophically, at least, the jury is the people, it's the people's foothold in this whole state-run system, and that's why we have a jury is to make sure that the tyrannical state doesn't just take over entirely, that the people always have a say.</p>
                        <p>0:43:47.8 Michael: And here, the jury was very clear, the jury was like, this is fucked up. The jury was like, this guy deserves a lot of money, a million dollars for every year he was on death row, which there's a very clear sort of logic to that, I think. And you have the Supreme Court saying fuck you, right? Eat shit, people. Eat shit to the people. Like you don't really get a say at the end of the day, your involvement is optional.</p>
                        <p>0:44:17.9 Peter: I would like to do an episode where I just make the same point about case titles over and over again, because The People v. Whoever just pisses me off so fucking much, like did I miss a vote? Was there a fucking referendum I missed out on over here?</p>
                        <p>0:44:32.7 Michael: And while we're talking about juries, I want to say, if you find this stuff compelling, you should consider it your moral duty if you're ever called in to jury duty to one, show up, not put it off, and two, say what you need to say to get on the jury, and then three, vote not guilty. That's called jury nullification and you should do it. When I got jury duty, I tried desperately to get on the jury to get some dude off, they were trying to railroad him with some pot conviction 'cause they couldn't stick some credit card fraud on him, and I was like, I'm going to fucking get on this jury and I'm going to make sure this guy gets off, but I didn't get selected.</p>
                        <p>0:45:13.3 Michael: Don't let that happen to you. Get selected. Fight the power. They can't stop you. What happens in the jury room is sacred, you're the people, you get the final say.</p>
                        <p>0:45:23.8 Peter: When I got called for jury duty, there's a new thing, certain jurisdictions, but New York, especially, where it used to be understood that if you were a lawyer, they're not going to pick you. Now, the opposite is true, they want a couple of lawyers on the jury to sort of guide people through the process. A lot of them think it's beneficial, and that's become popular. And I'll never forget the look on the face of the guy, the Goldman Sachs attorney who was sitting next to me when he got selected, just blood drained from his face. He had to go back to his senior VP boss and be like, I'm going to be on a trial for two weeks, and you are legally obligated to let me go.</p>
                        <p>0:46:03.0 Michael: What will our clients do without someone telling them to invest in Tesla for two weeks?</p>
                        <p>0:46:13.4 Rhiannon: Thinking about this case and prepping for this episode, I was thinking a lot about how the discovery sort of process, just how that plays out kind of day-to-day, in the life of a public defender, of someone defending people in this system. And I just want to say that the state has, like we said up top, true monopoly on evidence that's presented in general, because like we said, they have exclusive control and power over the investigation, over all of the evidence that's collected, and then they have exclusive control and power over what gets turned over.</p>
                        <p>0:46:51.7 Rhiannon: And this case is, it's so obvious that the district attorney's office really conspired against Mr. Thompson in withholding, hiding, maybe even literally destroying, clearly exculpatory evidence, but in your day-to-day prosecutions for simple drug possession, for simple assaults for petty theft, we are constantly fighting over what gets turned over, right, this is not a just egregious example, I mean, it is an egregious example because of the stakes, right, because Mr. Thompson went to prison for nearly 20 years, he was almost executed, but in terms of the pattern, which is what he established here, the pattern is obvious n any prosecutor's Office in the country.</p>
                        <p>0:47:40.2 Rhiannon: I don't care if you're a progressive prosecutor's office or not, the idea of the state having full control over what gets turned over automatically means that the defense is already and always at a disadvantage, and it means that the defense is often having to fight about little tiny things constantly. Will you turn over the surveillance video, turn over the analysis of those drugs, turn over the witness' statement. I know that police talk to them, you have to turn that over.</p>
                        <p>0:48:15.3 Michael: Fight tooth and nail just for the materials you need to present a defense.</p>
                        <p>0:48:19.1 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly, that's right. And so just want to highlight what a disadvantage to that is and how this fight is constantly happening day in and day out with every defense attorney, with every prosecutor in the country.</p>
                        <p>0:48:33.1 Peter: Yeah, Rhi, I want to get your thoughts on this, because we keep having people asking us and asking you specifically for your thoughts on progressive prosecutors. So that our listeners are aware, there's sort of a movement and a trend of the so-called progressive prosecutors, which are prosecutors who are, in their own words, progressive, and will take progressive stances in terms of what they prosecute, in terms of tactics they use in prosecuting their cases, right. They're not gonna be prosecuting a simple drug possession and things like that, they will be advocating for prosecution that endorses certain types of policing that are viewed more favorably by progressives, etcetera, and just generally sort of trying to use the prosecutorial role to shift the prosecution in a more progressive direction. And I know you've mentioned that you have some big picture concerns about that.</p>
                        <p>0:49:28.4 Rhiannon: That's right. When I am thinking about the progressive prosecutor movement and my opinions about it, for one, I practice currently in a jurisdiction with an elected prosecutor who sort of identifies as a progressive prosecutor. You might have heard of Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, George Gascon just got elected in Los Angeles in California. And I just think like this case, Connick v. Thompson, is a really, really good example of my problem with the progressive prosecutor movement. Now, that's not to say, of course, that Connick in the 1980s in New Orleans was any kind of progressive prosecutor or identified as such, right, but this case really shows the limitations, I think, of the progressive prosecutor movement.</p>
                        <p>0:50:12.9 Rhiannon: And that's because this case shows the system that progressive prosecutors are entering into, like this is a system of attaining convictions over anything else, and in which your definition of justice, which is what prosecutors have a duty to, your definition of justice is punishment. Prosecutors and the police, and I consider them one and the same, they are the engineers of mass incarceration, the state decides what is criminal activity, and then it decides who gets charged with criminal activity, who gets surveilled for criminal activity, and then the state has its monopoly on resources and power and violence to try the people it chooses, all under the threat of sending those chosen people to prison, right.</p>
                        <p>0:50:58.3 Rhiannon: And so if you are a progressive prosecutor, this is the system in which you are operating, in which the tools at your disposal are punishment to get to justice. And so if you are sending somebody to be caged, and the way you do that is by being very meticulous and very careful about what exactly gets turned over to the defense, I don't see a progressive sort of system of doing that. So on the one hand, a progressive prosecutor, when they say, there's these maybe category of cases that we're not going to prosecute anymore, we won't prosecute, say, simple drug possession or petty thefts or other crimes of poverty, simple criminal trespass, which sort of disproportionately affects homeless people, for example, I'm not ever gonna critique that, that's fantastic. You've made a sort of instant and short-term and positive impact on a community, on a group of people who would otherwise have been sort of swept up into the system, and that's fantastic.</p>
                        <p>0:52:00.0 Rhiannon: Another example being progressive prosecutor offices saying that they're not gonna ask for money bail in their cases, they're not going to incarcerate people pre-trial just because they can't pay to get out. That's also fantastic, right. But again, I always return to the idea that if on any level, your definition of justice and the tools that you have for supposedly attaining justice are to cage somebody in a completely imperfect system in which police are biased, prosecutors are biased, judges are biased against people of color and the poor, then none of these convictions are legitimate, and I just think that a truly progressive prosecutor's office, that to me could only occur if a prosecutor takes office and commits 100% to diverting the resources that a prosecutor's office has into actual services for people of color and the poor in their jurisdiction, so not just diversionary courts, right. Not just probation over prison, but actual services that divert people away from the criminal punishment system to begin with.</p>
                        <p>0:53:11.6 Michael: Right, and I think to that point, you see it just about every time there's a progressive prosecutor elected, you see there are revolts from their ADAS.</p>
                        <p>0:53:21.5 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:53:22.3 Michael: Which are their assistant district attorneys, the ones who like prosecute cases and who will leak to the press, who will defy them, who will talk about resignations, you see push back from judges who will impose money bail even if it's not requested. You see it from all ends, in the papers, you see local papers will vilify them and start talking about crime. We saw this in New York when the second cash bail reform came about, all of a sudden all the local media was talking about up-ticks in crime, and the entire system is going be fighting them in their own office, in their own capacity, they take it from all directions, so there's like real limits to what you can do whatever your intentions are.</p>
                        <p>0:54:14.0 Peter: There's something that we've talked about in various different contexts on this podcast. A couple of weeks ago, in Toyota v. Williams, we talked about the inadequacy of workplace discrimination laws and that the real solution is the concentration of power in labor. And we've talked about the same thing in the context of, for example, cops, the solution to abuse of power by cops is not nice cops. The solution to abuse of power by employers is not nice employers. The solution to abuse of power by prosecutors is not nice prosecutors, it's removing the power that prosecutors have and shifting it elsewhere. That is how you get something that looks like actual substantial reform. And that is why the sort of progressive prosecutor concept is always going to be like good, but limited, no matter what.</p>
                        <p>0:55:07.1 Peter: It's not a systemic reform, every other part of the system rebels like it's a fucking invasive species, just being rejected by the disgusting decrepit, racist host body, and you're never going to see the sort of sweeping system-wide change just by everyone shaking hands and being like we're gonna be nicer, I'm one of the good ones. That's just not how change happens, change happens by reallocating power into the hands of people who did not have it previously.</p>
                        <p>0:55:38.7 Michael: I would like some credit from you guys. When you said the answer is not nicer cops, like immediately I was like, it's dead cops. But I stopped myself.</p>
                        <p>0:55:55.1 Rhiannon: That's gross.</p>
                        <p>0:55:55.2 Michael: I held it back.</p>
                        <p>0:56:00.0 Peter: Next week, Hoffman Plastics v. National Labor Relations Board, a case about whether an undocumented immigrant can get a remedy under the law for having his rights violated.</p>
                        <p>0:56:14.8 Michael: I'm excited already.</p>
                        <p>0:56:16.4 Peter: Oh, God. You spend a lot of energy on being outraged about Connick v. Thompson and then just to introduce a new different kind of outrage into your mind, right afterwards, it's exhausting, I've got to say. Follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod.

                        <p>0:00:02.1 S?: We'll hear argument now in number 001089, Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Ella Williams.</p>
                        <p>0:00:13.5 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael discuss Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams, a 2001 case about the Americans With Disabilities Act. The plaintiff in the case, Ella Williams, was fired by Toyota, which cited poor attendance. Williams sued, claiming the Toyota had failed to accommodate her disability, carpal tunnel, and that it had been exacerbated by her work on the assembly line.</p>
                        <p>0:00:38.7 S?: The Justices said this Kentucky Toyota plant did not have to find another job for an employee who suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome and could no longer work on the assembly line. The decision found that Ella Williams' partial disability did not substantially limit her major life activities.</p>
                        <p>0:00:55.5 Leon: In a unanimous opinion, the Court sent the case back down to the lower court, which eventually ruled against Williams.</p>
                        <p>0:01:01.8 S?: We're in this bizarre twilight zone where we're too disabled apparently to work, but yet we're not disabled enough to be covered under the law.</p>
                        <p>0:01:12.0 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:01:23.4 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have ground our liberties to the bone, like the cartilage in a veteran NBA player's knees. I am Peter, I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:35.5 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:39.2 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:39.3 Rhiannon: Hello.</p>
                        <p>0:01:39.5 Peter: How's everyone doing today?</p>
                        <p>0:01:40.9 Rhiannon: Chillin', bro.</p>
                        <p>0:01:42.7 Michael: Doing well.</p>
                        <p>0:01:44.1 Peter: Today's case is Toyota v. Williams. This is a case from 2002 about the Americans With Disabilities Act, which among other things, protects people with disabilities in their workplace, and what this case involves is the question of what exactly it means to be disabled. So if you're a thoughtful person, you might realize that that's not a very easy question to answer, and to avoid bringing anyone else to do this, I will use myself as our initial example. I've got mild scoliosis, it has resulted in some pain, some injuries, and it means I cannot safely do certain heavy lifting, but if you observed my day-to-day life, you would probably never know there was an issue. In fact, I saw a chiropractor, who didn't even mention it, once when I was young.</p>
                        <p>0:02:34.2 Michael: Shocked, shocked that a chiropractor would miss that.</p>
                        <p>0:02:38.5 Peter: Might have noticed a misalignment of the spine, but no, he just rolled with it. It was just like, this guy is fine. I'm just just gonna keep yanking...</p>
                        <p>0:02:46.4 Rhiannon: I'm just gonna crack him up.</p>
                        <p>0:02:48.2 Peter: I also have what at least one doctor has described as a fairly severe case of ADHD...</p>
                        <p>0:02:53.7 Rhiannon: No, you're joking.</p>
                        <p>0:02:57.9 Peter: Obviously, you guys are shocked, but this is a real thing.</p>
                        <p>0:03:01.0 Michael: You guys don't hear what these recording sessions are like, but it's... If you heard the uncut tape, you would not be shocked.</p>
                        <p>0:03:07.5 Peter: Alright, everybody settle down. So this has... It impacted my school work growing up, it impacts my focus at work now, so am I disabled? I'm less able to accomplish certain things than your average person might be. Like I said, it affects my work. But I think a lot of people would be hesitant to categorize me as disabled, while they might be very ready to label someone who is paralyzed below the waist as disabled, even if that person was a white collar professional who otherwise had a similar day-to-day experience.</p>
                        <p>0:03:44.2 Peter: The point being, everyone is beset with a different set of physical and cognitive limitations, and the scope of those limitations is colored by the intersection of medicine and technology and socio-cultural factors, and so today's case poses a simple question: What if instead of having experts and people with lived experience grapple with the question of what constitutes a disability by confronting all of these complexities, we just had some lawyers hash it out?</p>
                        <p>0:04:13.2 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:04:13.5 Rhiannon: No risk. It'll turn out great.</p>
                        <p>0:04:18.9 Leon: So Rhiannon, walk us through some background here, let's go.</p>
                        <p>0:04:24.3 Rhiannon: Sure. So I think it would help to talk about the ADA, the Americans With Disabilities Act, a little bit upfront. So just a couple of things about the ADA. The primary purpose of this legislation was to create more employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Numerous studies throughout basically the '80s and into the late '80s showed that of all minority groups, disabled people in the United States were the most economically disadvantaged. In 1988, for example, two-thirds of working age people with disabilities were not working, and the number of under-employed people with disabilities was even higher.</p>
                        <p>0:05:05.3 Rhiannon: But studies also showed that there weren't concrete business reasons for why this was happening. The vast majority of individuals with disabilities who were studied said they wanted to work in full-time positions, and that when they did have full-time jobs, they maintained above-average work attendance and productivity. So of course, we want to point out that a person's value and contribution in society shouldn't ever be tied to these vague measures of workplace productivity, but this is the information that Congress was looking at in the late '80s, early '90s, when they drew the conclusion that disabled people were being discriminated against in the workforce. Public and private sector employers couldn't use the excuse that there was a loss in productivity by employing people with disabilities, for instance.</p>
                        <p>0:05:52.9 Rhiannon: The reality was that this was about discrimination against people with disabilities, and that discrimination was leading to serious economic harm to people with disabilities. The organization today known as the National Council on Disability noted that in 1988, 20% of people with disabilities in the US lived in poverty. Justin Dart, who was a disability rights advocate and co-founder of the American Association of People With Disabilities, he testified in front of Congress when they were passing the ADA. He testified that discrimination against people with disabilities was "driving us inevitably towards an economic and moral disaster of giant paternalistic welfare bureaucracies. We are already paying unaffordable and rapidly escalating billions in public and private funds to maintain ever-increasing millions of potentially productive Americans in unjust unwanted dependency."</p>
                        <p>0:06:50.5 Rhiannon: And so again, when passing the ADA, Congress looked at hard data and created comprehensive legislation to primarily increase economic opportunities for people with disabilities and to protect them from discrimination that was not only extremely harmful, but commonplace across the workforce. So let's turn to the facts of this case. This is the story of a woman named Ella Williams. Williams got a job at the Toyota Motor Company in the early '90s, and she moved her family, in fact, across the state to take the job as an assembly line worker at Toyota's plant in Georgetown, Kentucky.</p>
                        <p>0:07:27.1 Rhiannon: You know, at the time, the average annual pay for assembly line workers for Toyota was $62,000. This is decent money for most families at the time, this is a solid opportunity for Williams and her family, but she would end up working for Toyota for just six years because over the course of her time there, she developed carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis in her upper body. And if you don't know, carpal tunnel syndrome is characterized by numbness and pain in your wrists and hands as a result of compressed nerve in the wrist, and tendinitis is irritation and inflammation of the tendons, and this condition causes severe pain and tenderness, especially around joints.</p>
                        <p>0:08:08.5 Rhiannon: But in describing her experience with these medical conditions, Ella Williams said, "I got lumps the size of a hen's egg in my wrists and my hands and fingers got curled up like animal claws." She also said, "I used pneumatic tools at work that really vibrated and I was always having to reach above my head."</p>
                        <p>0:08:26.7 Peter: I love the Kentucky charm of the hen's egg visual.</p>
                        <p>0:08:31.8 Rhiannon: As a result, Toyota took her off the assembly line and they gave her a job as a paint inspector, where she worked satisfactorily, according to job reviews, for a little while, but then in 1996, the job duties changed and Williams was required to take on more physical tasks again. And again, these job activities caused her significant pain in her upper body, especially her shoulders, her arms and her hands. This was more than mere discomfort on the job for Williams. As a result of the progressive nature of these conditions, she eventually needed help getting dressed, she stopped being able to drive long distances with her family, she had to limit her participation in recreational activities that she previously had enjoyed, like gardening and dancing, and really importantly, just in terms of her quality of life, she said that the worsening pain and immobility she experienced limited the time that she was able to spend playing with her kids and doing activities with them that required her to do physical movement.</p>
                        <p>0:09:32.2 Rhiannon: She repeatedly asked for accommodations at work so that she could keep her job with Toyota, but after missing work numerous times, Toyota eventually fired her. So Ella Williams sued under the ADA, arguing that she was discriminated against as a result of her disability and she wasn't given accommodations that she was owed under the law.</p>
                        <p>0:09:52.2 Michael: That's right. And before we get into it, I want to note that there's like a whole constellation of issues here, and there was a bunch of litigation, there was potential workers compensation claims, there were claims under their Family Medical Leave Act, under Kentucky's state workers comp laws, those things all exist. We're not looking at them today, a lot of them weren't implicated in this litigation at all, in this particular case, what we're interested in here is specifically her request for accommodation because she wanted to keep her job under the ADA and how that shook out and how the Court interpreted it.</p>
                        <p>0:10:30.2 Peter: Maybe before we get into the law, we should talk about who the lawyer for Toyota was.</p>
                        <p>0:10:37.7 Michael: Oh, that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:10:37.7 Rhiannon: I want to give listeners three seconds to guess. Okay, this is the early '90s...</p>
                        <p>0:10:43.7 Peter: No, it's like 2001, by the time it's actually in the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:10:47.7 Rhiannon: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:10:49.5 Michael: It's a pod favorite, folks.</p>
                        <p>0:10:50.2 Rhiannon: Who would be representing Toyota in front of the Supreme Court...</p>
                        <p>0:10:57.5 Peter: If you guessed Chief Justice John Roberts...</p>
                        <p>0:11:01.2 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:11:03.1 Rhiannon: Gold star for you.</p>
                        <p>0:11:04.8 Peter: John Roberts, crazy coincidence working for the large corporation here.</p>
                        <p>0:11:10.3 Rhiannon: Against people's workplace protections and accommodations.</p>
                        <p>0:11:14.6 Peter: Yeah, just a fun little fact to keep in mind. He ran around the room high-fiving all the Justices before his argument. Alright, so like Rhi said, the Americans With Disabilities Act, a law passed that prevents discrimination against disabled people in the workplace, and part of that is a requirement that employers must accommodate employees with disabilities. Now, that doesn't mean that they have to keep you employed if you have a condition that prevents you from doing the job altogether, but it does mean they have to accommodate you by taking reasonable steps to provide you with an environment where you can perform the work, if that's possible.</p>
                        <p>0:11:51.5 Peter: So for example, if your job is that you paint tiny little photo-realistic paintings with immense precision and then someone chops off your hands, your employer, which is the tiny painting shop, they don't have to keep you employed, because you can no longer do the job at all, but if you just hurt your fingers such that you paint a little more slowly, but at the end of the day, you can still paint the tiny paintings with photo-realistic imagery, then they would have to accommodate you under the Americans With Disabilities Act, they would have to sort of say, okay, let's figure out how we can make this work.</p>
                        <p>0:12:30.9 Peter: Simple enough. So, Ella Williams has carpal tunnel syndrome, and she claims that Toyota failed to accommodate her and otherwise discriminated against her when they fired her because of her disability. But what Toyota claims in response is that under the Americans With Disabilities Act, she's actually not disabled, so Toyota can't be liable. And the Court, in a unanimous opinion, authored by Sandra Day O'Connor, agrees with Toyota. They say, yeah, she hasn't shown that she's actually disabled here.</p>
                        <p>0:13:04.0 Peter: So let's dig in a bit. What the law says is that to qualify as a disability, something has to "substantially limit a major life activity." the law gives examples of major life activities, walking, seeing, hearing, learning, working. This lady has carpal tunnel syndrome, quite severe, if you believe her account, right? So she struggles to perform tasks with her hands. The job involved, among other things, applying certain oils to cars on an assembly line that required her to hold her hands and arms up around shoulder height, she claimed, for several hours at a time. So she's got carpal tunnel, she's got a job where they're requiring her to extensively use her arms and hands. It seems simple, right?</p>
                        <p>0:13:55.6 Rhiannon: Right. Just a clear path here.</p>
                        <p>0:13:57.8 Michael: This is the defective lawyer brain, and this is how law school breaks your brain.</p>
                        <p>0:14:02.2 Peter: Like, how do you get this circumstance, nine elite lawyers agreeing with Toyota. So again, the question is, does this substantially limit a major life activity? And Sandra Day O'Connor kicks off the analysis by saying that "substantially" is defined as considerable or to a large degree. Thank you, Sandra. Then she says that "major" is defined as important.</p>
                        <p>0:14:33.3 Rhiannon: She pulled out the dictionary, folks, she's on it. She took her Adderall that morning and she said, baby, gimme Webster's.</p>
                        <p>0:14:43.4 Peter: So again, just knocking it out of the park so far, nothing but net. Thank God she defined substantially as considerable.</p>
                        <p>0:14:52.3 Michael: That is one you really need the dictionary for.</p>
                        <p>0:14:55.2 Peter: Otherwise I would have no idea what it meant. She first notes that "It is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability status under this test to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis." Instead, what she's saying is that instead they have to submit evidence of their experience with a disability. So right off the bat, we are sort of rejecting medical expertise here and going straight to what can only be described as sort of a vibes check. Do you feel disabled? Are you feeling disabled?</p>
                        <p>0:15:37.3 Michael: Get those x-rays out of my face.</p>
                        <p>0:15:40.9 Peter: I have to say, this feels like an area where perhaps we should have some doctors weighing in, maybe someone with specific expertise in disabilities of some kind. Anyone besides a lawyer would be great.</p>
                        <p>0:15:55.3 Michael: Yeah, absolutely. And a good example of the idiocy of her particular lawyer brain, although I guess everyone signed off on this opinion, so I shouldn't let them off the hook either. She says, look, when Congress enacted the ADA in 1990, they said that some 43 million Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities. I was like, that's a lot. She follows that with, if Congress intended everyone with a physical impairment that precluded the performance of some isolated, unimportant or particularly difficult manual task to qualify as disabled, the number of disabled Americans would have surely been much higher, which I... Really? I looked it up, there were 250 million Americans in 1990, which makes that almost 1 out of 5 Americans. That's a lot, that's like most workplaces would have multiple people with disabilities under the ADA.</p>
                        <p>0:16:53.5 Michael: And she's like shrugging it off like, oh, it's not that much. It's not everybody. It's not the entire workforce.</p>
                        <p>0:17:01.3 Peter: Yeah, the rest of her argument in this case borders in my view on being incoherent. She says the question isn't whether this woman is unable to do this job, what matters is whether she can do any job, and so even though she cannot do this one because of the carpal tunnel, she might not count as disabled because she can do other jobs. And Sandra just goes on for a couple of paragraphs, essentially downplaying this woman's disability, noting that she can carry out most day-to-day tasks that people do.</p>
                        <p>0:17:32.4 Michael: Right, right. She says that the lower court that they're reversing ignored important evidence, like the fact that she could tend to her personal hygiene and carry out household chores like bathing and brushing one's teeth. It feels like satire. It's like, oh, you say you can't lift heavy objects or do repetitive manual tasks without pain, yet you can brush your teeth every morning. I got you right.</p>
                        <p>0:18:02.7 Peter: Right. My friend Dave's been telling me his whole life that he needs that wheelchair, but I see him brushing his teeth every single day. What's going on with this guy?</p>
                        <p>0:18:10.1 Rhiannon: It doesn't make sense.</p>
                        <p>0:18:11.3 Michael: It's this insane way of looking at it, like we have to remove all context from your life and decide from this behind a veil of ignorance whether you are "disabled" and then plug you back into your life and go from there.</p>
                        <p>0:18:27.9 Rhiannon: Right. And I just want to add that John Roberts, the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, when he was arguing this in front of the Supreme Court in the early 2000s on behalf of Toyota, Sandra Day O'Connor's language is almost straight lifted from John Roberts' oral argument. He was the one who said on the record that Ella Williams can walk, she can brush her teeth, she can bathe, and so she's not really disabled. And the other thing I want to say is how much this kind of language and this kind of talking about what it means to be disabled or not disabled or to have a disability, how much it's steeped in stigma and stereotype, exactly the kind that the ADA was targeted at eliminating, right, and the Supreme Court here, Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion, is really just reproducing that incredibly stigmatizing language about what it means to be disabled and putting that in the holding.</p>
                        <p>0:19:23.7 Michael: Right, and the final point I want to make is that she also was like, look, yes, sure, dressing yourself, that's sort of like in those categories, but she only needed help dressing herself sometimes.</p>
                        <p>0:19:33.5 Rhiannon: Right, which is wild.</p>
                        <p>0:19:35.7 Michael: So that's not really disabled on the record here.</p>
                        <p>0:19:35.8 Peter:</p>
                        <p>0:19:38.3 Leon: Right. I want to point out, there's a degree to which this sort of dichotomy where you're saying these people have to be so severely disabled for the ADA to protect them that they can't even brush their teeth, it really undermines the whole function of the law with respect accommodations at work. Accommodation is meant for people who are not severely disabled, obviously, because the whole point is that you can do most of the job, you can do the basics of the job, so they're creating a situation where someone has to be severely disabled for the ADA to apply, but not so disabled that they can't do the job, and it's not true that that Venn diagram has any overlap, it erases the function of the law.</p>
                        <p>0:20:21.3 Peter: And that's the whole point of this part of the ADA, that employers must accommodate people whose disability impacts their ability to do their specific job. So when you say that their ability to perform that specific job is irrelevant, you have completely divorced the application of the statute from its meaning. This woman is saying, hey, my disability prevents me from doing this job, so they should accommodate me and maybe not fire me, right. And the Court is saying, well, yeah, but you could do other jobs, and it's like, well, yes, but this law is about workplace accommodations for people with disabilities. What's the point of that if they don't have to accommodate you based on your specific workplace?</p>
                        <p>0:20:58.0 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly. It's so stupid.</p>
                        <p>0:21:01.2 Michael: It's remarkable.</p>
                        <p>0:21:04.3 Peter: What O'Connor is reading the ADA as doing is dividing people cleanly into two categories, disabled and not disabled. But like I mentioned up top, the reason I got into my scoliosis and ADHD is because the reality of what it means to be disabled is not very clear. There's a wide range of ways in which a person's physical and cognitive function might be limited relative to their peers, and it doesn't do any good to try to draw a bright line between disabled and not disabled. Put another way, O'Connor is asking the question, is she disabled? But that's the wrong question. The question is, does this woman's condition impact her ability to do this job.</p>
                        <p>0:21:47.5 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:21:49.3 Peter: Before we move on a bit, I think we should note that the Court does not hold that she is not disabled, they just send the issue down to the lower court to re-evaluate whether or not she is based on this sort of new framework, this bright line that they have created. But I think the way that O'Connor has framed this question completely shifts the way that all future courts have to analyze it, using this childish binary, disabled not disabled categorization, where disabled people are people who are so debilitated that they can barely participate in society, in the workplace and take care of themselves and non-disabled people are everyone else, just removing any sort of gray area in the analysis of what being disabled actually means.</p>
                        <p>0:22:33.0 Michael: Right. And I also want to note, she mentions in sending it back to the lower court, that part of that's the posture that it came up in, and that they weren't in position to do that, but I think it was pretty clear how the Court wants the lower court to find here, right. They want it to say she's not disabled. That comes through loud and clear in this.</p>
                        <p>0:22:56.8 Peter: Right, and so the dissent here... Oh, my bad. No dissent here. Marking, I believe, is this our first unanimous case? I think it might be.</p>
                        <p>0:23:09.6 Michael: I think so.</p>
                        <p>0:23:11.5 Peter: Which is just remarkable. I was telling you guys that I was, I think, mixing this up with another employment discrimination case, and I thought the whole time I was prepping this, I was like, it's a 5-4 decision, and the discovery that not a single Justice... Not a single Justice found this offensive, I can't even fucking tell you how poisoned the minds of lawyers across the world are.</p>
                        <p>0:23:32.0 Rhiannon: It's beyond ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>0:23:33.8 Michael: Yeah, and before we continue, let's take a break.</p>
                        <p>0:23:39.8 Michael: Alright, we're back, and I wanted to talk a little bit about my personal experience with the ADA, because I think I've mentioned this on Twitter before, but if you don't know, I have a bipolar diagnosis and have struggled a few times with some severe bipolar depression. And when I was at a big law firm, I had to take time off under the ADA in a period of acute, acute depression, and I'm not sure that there's a better accommodation than what they offered me, which was literally unpaid leave as long as I wanted it with the promise that my job would be back with no reputational or ill effects when I was able to work again.</p>
                        <p>0:24:21.9 Michael: And I am blessed to have a comfortable enough life and enough built-up wealth and a wealthy enough family that I could take four months off without making money, and that was okay, and I could afford to go to a therapist two or three times a week and try a bunch of different meds, like off-label uses that insurance doesn't cover to try to take care of that. But most people aren't like that blessed and that accommodation isn't really available to them the way it was to me. And as far as accommodations go, it's not really much of one, right?</p>
                        <p>0:25:07.3 Rhiannon: Yeah, good point.</p>
                        <p>0:25:08.9 Michael: Like we'll essentially hire you back at some point. And I've always thought about it because I think it's sort of emblematic of the way our culture views people and their worth. Like this is all an outcropping of the idea that our ability to keep a roof over head or feed ourselves should be tied to our ability to be productive and be socially useful members of the country. And if we can't...</p>
                        <p>0:25:40.3 Rhiannon: Economically useful.</p>
                        <p>0:25:42.3 Michael: Right, economically... Yeah, not even socially useful. Economically useful member of society. And so in this case, I wasn't able to do that at all, and so I wasn't gonna make any money. And the ADA, all it's doing is smoothing out the edges on that. Well, that's too heartless in the case of someone who gets a debilitating injury, but otherwise wants to work and can do some work, we should let them work. Where is the inherent dignity that we treat people? And to take this law that's already sort of... I think its very existence highlights like the inadequacy of the way we treat our people in general, let alone people who are struggling with disabilities, and then gut it like this and make it less useful and less helpful, and just make our country that much crueler and colder. I don't know, reading this case, I was just like, I was just disgusted.</p>
                        <p>0:26:40.0 Michael: The fact that it was 9-0, that it was unanimous too, is just incredibly heartless, it's one of the more heartless decisions we've read, in my opinion.</p>
                        <p>0:26:50.7 Leon: I think I've talked about this on the show before, but there's a degree to which capitalism relies on the conflation of economic outcomes and moral outcomes, like there's this idea in American culture especially, that people do well because they deserve it, and if they don't do well, they deserve that too. And the conclusion that you're meant to draw is that whether someone is deserving of a decent life, of human dignity, is tied to their ability to perform in a workplace, such that even our analysis of people with severe physical limitations is not, how can we make life better for this person, it's sort of how can we fit this broken cog into our money-making machine. That's the framework that the Court is using here, and our baseline assumption remains that people who cannot perform work simply don't deserve to have their needs met. There's no other conclusion you could draw from the society that we've built.</p>
                        <p>0:27:47.4 Michael: Well, not our perception, to be clear, not our podcast's.</p>
                        <p>0:27:52.7 Peter: I mean as a capitalist society, alright, I mean, God, you guys aren't letting me wheel free here.</p>
                        <p>0:27:57.5 Michael: Well, I just want to be clear. I don't want to get cancelled as you were loose with your language.</p>
                        <p>0:28:04.8 Peter: And if we want to be like a moral society, our rejection of that notion needs to go beyond this lady should be given an accommodation by Toyota, which is of course true, it should go to the very fundamental proposition, right, if someone is even just unskilled or unintelligent through no particular fault of their own, or even through fault of their own, can you really and sincerely make the claim that you deserve a better life than them, that you deserve to be treated with more dignity than them. And capitalist structures want you to say yes, that they deserve less than you do, but I think if you have any semblance of a moral center, you have to say no to that. That is what I think it really sticks out to me about this case. It feels like something that could only be produced in a society as sort of completely hollow as ours.</p>
                        <p>0:28:55.5 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's exactly right, and really well said, Peter, and that brings me back to sort of the judicial principles, the legal principles that are animating this decision. One big thing I'm thinking a lot about is conservative, supposed judicial restraint. We talked about this as a foundational philosophy that supposedly was central to Justice Antonin Scalia's jurisprudence, and I think there's some hypocrisy to draw out in this case too.</p>
                        <p>0:29:23.8 Rhiannon: So here, what the Court is limiting is congressional action that was aimed at remedying inequity in our society. The Americans With Disabilities Act was intended to establish or really is born out of the foundational idea that people with disabilities are qualified to work, and that stereotypes indicating otherwise are harmful, they're harmful to people who were being forced to live in poverty because job opportunities were so slim, it was harmful to the economy at large, sort of every level of society, and the ADA was about protecting people from bias and stereotype that unjustly limit their economic self-sufficiency. And of course, that in turn limits personal autonomy, freedom, long-term health and wellness outcomes all the way down the line.</p>
                        <p>0:30:14.7 Rhiannon: And I think it's important to know a little bit more about the background of the ADA and what Congress specifically intended to remedy when they passed the ADA. So the ADA was built off of an earlier, smaller piece of legislation that was passed in the 1970s called the Rehabilitation Act, and that law prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability in federal agencies and programs that got federal funding. In 1990, when the ADA was passed, Congress recognized some limitations of the Rehabilitation Act that it sought to change.</p>
                        <p>0:30:46.8 Rhiannon: First, the Rehabilitation Act only applied to federally funded agencies and organizations, so the private sector was completely left out; and then secondly, a major problem with the Rehabilitation Act was that it left out definitive interpretation guidelines, which ended up leading to kind of erratic judicial interpretations. That means that reasonable accommodations and discrimination standards, those were never fully developed into agreed-upon legal tests that courts could use when reviewing workers' claims of discrimination on the basis of disability.</p>
                        <p>0:31:22.5 Rhiannon: So the ADA specifically sought to fix those two issues. The ADA was known as an example of a so-called second generation Civil Rights legislation, and the hubris of the Court here in limiting the ADA like this is really infuriating, like none of the conservatives would say that this case is an example of judicial activism, but it literally is, it's the definition of judicial activism, and conservatives will deride and spit on supposed judicial activism all day, but what they really mean to ridicule is when courts view expansive Civil Rights legislation expensively and when they're protecting people's rights under the law, the way the law is currently written.</p>
                        <p>0:32:06.8 Rhiannon: And when judicial activism like this is done in service of relegating people to permanent under-class status in our society, when it's done in service of damaging stigma and stereotype, when it's done in service of economic violence, that's totally fine with them, and they won't call it judicial activism.</p>
                        <p>0:32:27.3 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:32:27.9 Peter: Before we wrap up, there's something I want to talk about, which is the ways in which the inadequacy of the state fosters adversarial relationships between workers and employers. Ella Williams has a condition that makes it difficult for her to do certain manual labor. There are countless others whose ability to engage with the job market is limited by their physical or cognitive capacity. So what are the options being presented to those people? Because you could imagine a robust welfare state that actually provides for people, that gives them the support they need to spend time searching for work they can do, or work part-time, or if you could even imagine it, not work at all, if that's what's best for them.</p>
                        <p>0:33:09.2 Peter: You can envision a government that provides safety to citizens who find themselves in these precarious and vulnerable positions, and that's why these sort of anti-discrimination laws, while useful, are always going to be inadequate. The reality of working is that the relationship between employer and employee is inherently adversarial, but a government that provides for its citizens more meaningfully, such that they are less reliant on work to exist day-to-day, can lower the stakes of that adversarial relationship, can take some steam out of that relationship.</p>
                        <p>0:33:42.9 Peter: These sorts of patchwork anti-discrimination laws don't do that. All they do is sort of change the rules of engagement. At the end of the day, you're still being forced to pry concessions from your employer in order to maintain your life and maintain your dignity, and that's why I think the only real broad reaching solution to problems like this is a strong organized labor movement. In Denmark, for example, and I think really across Northern Europe, where the regimes are often viewed as being relatively favorable to workers, there are no minimum wage laws, and yet wages there are far higher than they are here. Why, because union participation in most of those countries is well above 75%. When labor is in an equal bargaining position, workers don't need to be given rights because they will take them for themselves.</p>
                        <p>0:34:36.4 Peter: I support the Americans With Disabilities Act and I support similar anti-discrimination laws, but always remember that these are Band-Aids on the gunshot wounds inflicted upon American labor by corporate interests. No matter how well-meaning these laws are, under the current framework, you will always be at the mercy of some corporation that can appeal to some dues-paying country club member judges, like the fucking Supreme Court, to determine the scope of your rights. And that's because at the end of the day, that's where the power lies. The only way to change that fundamental dynamic is to change who has the power, and that's why no matter what the laws are, you're going to end up with bullshit like this. The way you change the way that workers interact with their employers is by giving them more power.</p>
                        <p>0:35:20.6 Michael: As an addendum to that, the more robust sort of social services and benefits you have, the easier it is for workers in a position of power to bargain. Like if you're not bargaining for healthcare because there's a robust government-provided healthcare system that let you focus on things like vacation, paid leave time, maximum hours and wages, right, and it doesn't have to be a trade-off between those things where you're trading off benefits for personal leave. So there's a real entire restructuring of our political economy that needs to be considered or needs to be done, really, if we want to have anything approaching a fair and just society.</p>
                        <p>0:36:10.0 Rhiannon: Just to vibe a little bit more, I've been thinking since we talked with Alec Karakatsanis about San Antonio v. Rodriguez, when he was talking about sort of imagining the Supreme Court deciding differently and deciding that our society did protect the poor from discrimination. For instance, when I found out when I learned that John Roberts argued this case to the Supreme Court and that now John Roberts, who represented the Toyota Corporation in front of the Supreme Court, now heads the Supreme Court as Chief Justice, I just thought about the possibility of imagining a world in which one of the Supreme Court Justices had spent a career as an assembly line worker at an auto shop, right, and how different these decisions would be, should people with real life experience and real work experience be making those decisions.</p>
                        <p>0:37:03.6 Michael: See, the limits of my lawyer brain were when you started that sentence, I was going to be like, yeah, what if Ella Williams' lawyer was... You were like, no, what if fucking Ella Williams was on the Supreme Court. Idiot. Like, what if we took these dumb-ass lawyers out of the equation altogether. I think that's a beautiful example of the way the law can be tunnel vision and unable to even think about things from a different perspective.</p>
                        <p>0:37:33.2 Rhiannon: And it's just because of this bullshit pipeline, right, it's the same people involved in the decision-making and making the decisions on these cases, they self-select into this tiny group of supposed elites, and that's it, they make the decisions for all of us.</p>
                        <p>0:37:47.6 Michael: Right. And is there anything more emblematic than the fact that the guy arguing this ended up being a Justice, right? It's a small club. It's a chummy, small club.</p>
                        <p>0:37:55.4 Rhiannon: Right, and now he leads the Supreme Court in deciding questions about the Americans With Disabilities Act, right, so how do you think those are going to come on?</p>
                        <p>0:38:02.9 Peter: I realize people will say, well, we can't have an assembly line worker on the Supreme Court, which I think I disagree with, but look, we'll start small, podcasters. We will work our way to the assembly line...</p>
                        <p>0:38:15.3 Michael: I've waited tables, and I have worked in a warehouse. Very briefly, but I did. I worked on a drill press.</p>
                        <p>0:38:21.4 Peter: A good chunk of my childhood jobs were warehouse jobs, by far the jobs I was the best at, by the way. I've never been better at a job than when it was just like, can you put this shit over there? I'm like, you got it, buddy.</p>
                        <p>0:38:33.0 Rhiannon: My ADD is raging and all I want to do is put shit over there.</p>
                        <p>0:38:38.8 Peter: I can do this job, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:38:42.3 Peter: Alright, big thank you to Erin Hawley who helped us prep this episode, she's an accessibility consultant, @GeekyGimp on Twitter. Erin, thanks very much.</p>
                        <p>0:38:51.8 Michael: Thank you, Erin.</p>
                        <p>0:38:53.1 Rhiannon: Thanks, Erin.</p>
                        <p>0:38:55.6 Peter: Next week, we're doing a Patreon-only, subscriber-only episode on the Trump Judges. Gonna do sort of a post-mortem on the damage done by Trump to the judiciary, look at some of the worst of the worst and what we're looking at in terms of just the next 40 to 50 years of all of our lives.</p>
                        <p>0:39:16.5 Rhiannon: Can't wait.</p>
                        <p>0:39:16.6 Peter: Follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod, support us at patreon.com/fivefourpod, all spelled out, and we will see you next week.</p>
                        <p>0:39:25.4 Michael: Bye.</p>
                        <p>0:39:25.7 Rhiannon: Bye.</p>

                        <p>0:00:01.4 S?: Next [0:00:02.0] ____ 71-1332, San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:00:11.9 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are joined by civil rights lawyer Alec Karakatsanis to discuss San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, an Equal Protection case from 1973. In this case, parents from an under-privileged school district in Texas sued over inequitable school funding.</p>
                        <p>0:00:35.0 S?: Well, are you saying that you're discriminated against in this school district because you're poor and these children's education, they're suffering because of that?</p>
                        <p>0:00:42.6 S?: They are. Well, the district is poor.</p>
                        <p>0:00:46.9 S?: And so what?</p>
                        <p>0:00:48.1 S?: So we have poor education.</p>
                        <p>0:00:50.0 Leon: But the Court rejected their claim.</p>
                        <p>0:00:52.1 S?: Today the Supreme Court in effect conceded the system may be discriminatory, but ruled 5-4 that it is constitutional.</p>
                        <p>0:00:58.6 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:01:07.8 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have dilapidated our liberty, like rising ocean temperatures have bleached the Great Barrier Reef. I'm Peter, I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:20.8 Rhiannon: Hey, hi, everyone.</p>
                        <p>0:01:22.2 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:23.0 Alec Karakatsanis: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:24.1 Peter: And our special guest, Alec Karakatsanis. Alec, welcome.</p>
                        <p>0:01:28.0 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>0:01:28.3 Michael: Hey, Alec.</p>
                        <p>0:01:29.2 Alec Karakatsanis: Hi everyone.</p>
                        <p>0:01:30.2 Peter: Alec is a civil rights lawyer and the founder and Director of Civil Rights Corps, an organization dedicated to systemic litigation, attacking injustice in the criminal legal system, most notably, in the recent challenges to cash bail systems across the country. His most recent published work is a book called Usual Cruelty: The Complicity of Lawyers in the Criminal Injustice System. Great to have you on, man. We appreciate you being here.</p>
                        <p>0:01:53.9 Rhiannon: We're so excited that you're here, Alec. Thank you.</p>
                        <p>0:01:56.7 Alec Karakatsanis: It's wonderful to be here. Thank you all.</p>
                        <p>0:01:58.4 Peter: Alec is best known for his work concerning the intersection of poverty and our legal system, and so we thought it would be great to have him on for today's case, which is San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez. This is much requested by our fans. It's a case from 1973, and it is a case that asks a very simple question: Does the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution protect people from being treated differently, based on their wealth? If you understand the premise of this podcast, or if you're otherwise familiar with the concept of America, you know how the Court answers that question.</p>
                        <p>0:02:38.9 Peter: This case is sort of tragic, not just because the outcome was terrible in and of itself, but because it really symbolized an opportunity for the Court to recognize the systemic, government-endorsed disparities between rich and poor and use the Constitution to do something about it. Instead, the Court turns a blind eye and leaves us with a deeply inequitable public school system that has continued to perpetuate horrific cycles of poverty in the ensuing half century.</p>
                        <p>0:03:06.2 Alec Karakatsanis: There's so much to say here. This opinion represents a very particular vision of what the US Constitution is, it's very formal and full of technicalities and based on guaranteeing certain sort of lofty legal principles at the expense of material reality. And education is a good thing, but then utterly denies the material resources that are needed to make that a reality. It's the product of a court system that, for centuries, has cared more about legal formalities than about the material sustenance of individual human beings and their bodies. A legal system that has said, for example, it can be a crime to be hungry and take groceries from the store or to be cold and shoplift a coat, and this opinion makes you wonder what could our world and our legal system have been like, if the Court was willing to require our society to meet its lofty commitments in actual material fact?</p>
                        <p>0:04:06.8 Peter: Right, a couple of weeks ago, we covered McCleskey v. Kemp, a case about systemic discrimination in the administration of the death penalty. I view this case in almost a similar vein, a huge missed opportunity on the part of the Court and part of a pattern of cases in the '70s and '80s, especially, that threw cold water on the idea of the Constitution as a vessel for addressing systemic inequalities. So Rhi, you're gonna walk us through some background here.</p>
                        <p>0:04:36.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right. And first of all, can we do a study about how many Texas cases we've covered on this podcast, because it feels like a not insignificant portion of the worst Supreme Court cases come out of my absolutely deranged home state. So you're welcome. I don't know. But actually really quick, before I get into the background, I wanna talk really quickly about something else, something I think it'd be cool for listeners to be clued in on before we get into the discussion. And it's two things, actually.</p>
                        <p>0:05:06.6 Rhiannon: First, we sometimes get feedback from listeners, kind of special requests, listeners who want us just once to cover a positive story, a good case from the Supreme Court. And second, a few episodes ago, this has really stuck with me, Peter talked about the aspiration and the possibility of the 14th Amendment, that there's no reason that we have to be reading the 14th Amendment the way conservatives are, the way it's been read in the past, and that a more expansive, dare I say, curious or imaginative view of the 14th Amendment could alleviate inequality and lead to more just outcomes in the law. And I think this case is actually a good example of these kinds of things. I'm not gonna say that Rodriguez is a good decision, it is not, it definitely is not, but I do think it provides a really interesting peek into small 'l', liberal, legal institutions, conservative ideology, and just like a jumping-off point, a track for legal challenges that imagine something so much better. And that's one reason that I'm really, really glad that we have Alec here to talk about this stuff with us today.</p>
                        <p>0:06:14.5 Rhiannon: So, let's get to the background. This case comes out of a challenge to the way Texas funds its schools. So in Texas, public elementary and secondary schools are financed through both state and local participation. The state funds all school districts at roughly the same amount, and so that establishes some minimum educational offerings at every school, but schools rely on local property tax revenues for supplemental funding, okay. So this led to a long history of financial inequality across the school districts in Texas. A school district in a poorer area had less funding than a school district where the residents were wealthy because the majority of the district's funding was based off of property values in that district. And so the result of this funding system is stark disparities in per pupil expenditures between wealthy school districts and poor school districts. The wealthy, primarily white areas of town, are able to contribute a much higher amount per child into their schools than poor minority areas.</p>
                        <p>0:07:21.6 Michael: Yeah, that's right. And there's an aspect of the Texas scheme that kind of flies under the radar because it's not really in issue in this case. I don't think the majority even mentions it, I'm only aware of it because Marshall mentions it in dissent, but it's just something that I found deeply offensive. And so I wanna highlight it really quickly, and it's that in this scheme, if any given school district wanted to raise its property tax rate in order to send more funds to the school, it had to do so by passing a referenda with the majority of all property owners, not voters. The idea of tying voting rights to property ownership is so insanely antiquated. I didn't believe it at first. And I re-read the paragraph that Marshall mentioned it multiple times, trying to make sure that I was not misunderstanding it, but then he says it again several times after that. And it's just such a vivid illustration of who the state is concerned with and who it is not, which is like, as we'll talk about, is very much what it's the heart of this case.</p>
                        <p>0:08:29.2 Peter: It's the equivalent of having only billionaires vote on a billionaire tax, right?</p>
                        <p>0:08:34.4 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly. That's a great illustration. Yeah, so in 1968, parents from the Edgewood School District sued several other school districts in this same area, including a wealthy district called Alamo Heights and another one called Northeast, and they sued the state of Texas as well. And at trial, the parents from Edgewood, the poorer school district, showed just how serious these funding disparities were. Edgewood is a poor district with a low tax base, and they demonstrated at trial how because of that, they couldn't hire qualified personnel to staff their schools and teach their kids. Their schools couldn't provide the facilities, the books, equipment, activities, all kinds of stuff that were afforded by the wealthier districts around them. And in fact, they provided a study that compared Edgewood with one of the other wealthy districts, the Northeast one, and that study found that the inequities permeated kind of every aspect of the quality of education and services that children were receiving in these two places.</p>
                        <p>0:09:36.4 Rhiannon: Like in the category of classroom space, Northeast, the rich district, had 70 square feet per child while Edgewood had 50 square feet per child. Northeast, that school district, had nine library books per student while Edgewood had less than four on average. Northeast, the richer district, their teacher-to-student ratio was 1:19 while Edgewood's was 1:28. It goes into other things too, like counselor services, right? Northeast, the richer district, had a counselor-to-student ratio of 1 to about 1500 while Edgewood was one to over 5000 students, and it goes all the way up. You could see it in drop-out rates at the high school level. Northeast's drop-out rate was 8%, while Edgewood's was 32%. We're talking one in three students dropping out of high school in the poorer school district, and that inequity, their studies showed, actually was growing, it was trending upwards.</p>
                        <p>0:10:38.9 Rhiannon: In 1968, when the study was originally done, the disparity between spending per student between Edgewood and Northeast was about $310. Northeast was able to spend about $300 more per pupil. In 1972, just four years later, it was almost $400, up to about $390. So parents in this poorer school district sued in Federal Court and their argument constitutionally is that their kids are being denied equal access to education based on their lack of wealth, and that this is a problem under the 14th Amendment.</p>
                        <p>0:11:14.0 Peter: Right, right. The lawsuit's brought on behalf of these students in impoverished districts and the Court in a 5-4 decision written by Justice Lewis Powell, back on our podcast for the second time...</p>
                        <p>0:11:25.3 Rhiannon: Being a dipshit again.</p>
                        <p>0:11:26.6 Peter: Putting in tons of work, rejects the claim. The basic question, to dig into the opinion a bit, that the Court tackles is whether this public school financing system is violating the Equal Protection Clause, and the students are saying... Are making what is a fairly novel claim, not entirely novel, but one that the Supreme Court has not addressed, that discriminating on the basis of wealth violates the Equal Protection Clause. This is particularly important because what they're really saying is that poverty should be a protected class, the same way that, for example, race or gender is, right?</p>
                        <p>0:12:00.6 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:12:00.9 Peter: The Equal Protection Clause works by saying that if there is discrimination across protected categories such as race or gender, the Court will scrutinize it more aggressively. So they're saying, hey, poverty, just like race and gender, is a category with a long history of oppression and discrimination in this country, you should use the Equal Protection Clause to protect the impoverished from being treated differently under the law just because of their wealth or lack thereof. And the Court essentially dodges this question. I read it through a few times and I thought it was a very convoluted analysis, but what they're basically saying is, look, there's no clear definition of who is poor here, right? Is it the people below the poverty line, is it people who are poor relative to another person or is it anyone in a poorer school district?</p>
                        <p>0:12:46.7 Peter: And without getting too granular, what they basically say is, look, the relationship of poverty to school districts is too imprecise. The poorest people don't always live in the poorest districts, and so we're not sure if we can do anything here. And then they say, this is not an exaggeration, although it's going to sound like one, they say, look, these people are getting some public education, right? It's not like they're getting no public education. The Court's argument is that the Equal Protection Clause doesn't require everything to be perfectly equal, just that everyone gets some sort of baseline education, right?</p>
                        <p>0:13:21.4 Peter: And they're sort of dismissing the idea that poorer communities are not getting that baseline education. In fact, what they say is, look, Texas claims that everyone gets an adequate education and we have no reason to believe that that's not true.</p>
                        <p>0:13:34.4 Rhiannon: Boom, lawyered. Great lawyer brain on that one. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:13:37.7 Peter: They don't quite reach the issue of whether poorer people are not a protected class. They're just saying, in this circumstance poorer people aren't definable or identifiable enough to be protected, which is I think absolutely bullshit and absolutely a dodge of the reality of the situation. Just because identifying the class in question is difficult or imprecise does not mean the Court should ignore the issue altogether, right?</p>
                        <p>0:14:02.7 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:14:02.7 Peter: Even clearly defining race or gender, to use the same examples, or nationality, is not always simple, but the Court has consistently held that those are protected categories. And what the Court is implying here is that because poorer school districts might contain some people who aren't poor and poor people might live in other areas, it can't really help them because anything it does would be a little too imprecise. This is a rhetorical tactic that reminded me of other conservative rhetorical tactics, if you've ever heard conservatives debate, they sort of hang their hat on technicalities like this to ignore systemic issues with some frequency. So if you've ever seen a discussion about racial privilege, for example, get derailed by a conservative pointing out that there is white poverty too, or something along those lines. It's not necessarily inaccurate in a vacuum, but it's an argument that is proffered in bad faith to deflect from the idea that systemic injustices exist and must be addressed as such. So the Court is relying on this idea that there's no meaningful correlation between impoverished people and impoverished school districts, and I think the bottom line there is, are you fucking kidding me? That can't be the whole thing here.</p>
                        <p>0:15:08.0 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly. And I think that the benefit of hindsight has this kind of being like, this is an absurd holding but definitely in line with conservative ideology. And now we look at it as if this holding maybe was predictable, but at this time, in the early '70s, we are just on the tail end of the Warren Court era, and there had been some Supreme Court cases before this that seemed to indicate that poverty could be ruled a protected class at the Supreme Court. There were a couple of cases in criminal law, for instance, in 1956, the Supreme Court held that states have to provide poor defendants with free copies of their trial transcripts so that they could appeal their cases, and they said in that case, "In criminal trials, a state can no more discriminate on account of poverty than on account of religion, race or color."</p>
                        <p>0:15:57.5 Rhiannon: A famous case from 1963, Gideon v. Wainwright, that's the case that ruled that the Sixth Amendment requires a state to provide you with an attorney if you couldn't afford to hire one, and it was outside of criminal law, too. A case in 1966, just a few years before this one, Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, that case struck down the use of a poll tax in state elections, and that case said that a state "Violates the Equal Protection Clause whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard. Voter qualifications have no relation to wealth." So this claim in Rodriguez that the families are making from the poorer school district, this ask of the Supreme Court, it's not out of left field, there was solid precedent to point to and say like, look, the Civil Rights Movement opened up the stark inequity this society is built on, and we're continuing to push the law in new ways to remedy those kinds of injustices.</p>
                        <p>0:16:57.6 Michael: Really quick, listening to you talk, Rhi, just reminded me, the majority relies on this student note in the Yale Law Journal, which basically said that there is actually not freely a connection between poverty and living in a poorer district for the purposes of this litigation. And I looked up the note, I was curious, I wanted to know who wrote it. I wanted to say their name on the podcast and talk about what sort of broken soul they must have that they felt the need to do this when they were in law school. It's unsigned, multiple authors, apparently. But what I thought was interesting was the very first sentences were, to your point, Rhi, and that the note was motivated by a concern that the Supreme Court was gonna do this, and they were talking about all these court cases that were suggesting it was gonna do this and decided to... The district court case, and the fact that it was probably gonna be accepted by the Supreme Court, there was a real fear amongst conservative ideologues that this was gonna come out the way we think it should have come out.</p>
                        <p>0:18:02.2 Rhiannon: Right, right. Alec, I know you've written and thought a lot about how lawyers and judges are actually a big part of the problem in sort of creating the injustices in the law and then perpetuating them. And I just wonder if you have any thoughts there about lawyers writing to the Supreme Court basically and saying, "Don't decide it this way, we're concerned about it."</p>
                        <p>0:18:21.9 Alec Karakatsanis: There's a constant dialogue between conservative future law clerks at elite institutions like the Yale Law Journal and the Harvard Law Review and their future employers in a year or two, there's a constant set of institutions and getaways and retreats and other sort of formal and informal mechanisms by which all of these people are constantly talking to each other and warning each other about the things that are gonna be threatening the conservative legal movement. It's something that people on the left just have not created, a whole infrastructure of accountability really is actually what it is. You cannot succeed in the conservative legal world without demonstrating for years your fealty to a certain set of principles, such that when you make it to certain positions, everybody knows that you're gonna toe the party line.</p>
                        <p>0:19:06.8 Alec Karakatsanis: But I think what's much more profoundly interesting to me about this case, and I liked what you said, Rhi, at the very beginning about how there's something... The opinion highlights how beautiful the law could be. It could have been a force for guaranteeing that children receive meaningful adequate resources for education, and instead, it's just yet another in a long line of cases by the Court that furthers the dominant hierarchies of power and wealth in our society.</p>
                        <p>0:19:34.1 Peter: Yeah. It reminds me of an aspect of the opinion, which is their discussion of the fundamental right to education. The analysis here can be pretty complex but generally speaking, the Court would look at the Constitution and our history and what society puts value in and decide whether or not that is a fundamental right under the Constitution. And what the court says is like, look, education is important, right? Of course, who could deny it, but nothing in the Constitution implies that a right to education exists, a fundamental right to education. In the Court's view, they can't say something is a fundamental right unless the Constitution sort of implies that it is. And what the plaintiffs had argued was, "Well, look, we've got rights to free speech and rights to vote, doesn't that sort of require implicitly a right to education for them to be meaningful?" Right, surely, an informed citizenry is really the goal here.</p>
                        <p>0:20:28.9 Rhiannon: Right. And meaningful civic engagement, that's only possible through an educated public.</p>
                        <p>0:20:34.4 Peter: Right. And the Court just outright rejects that and they literally say, "Well, look, you have the right to speak and vote, but that doesn't mean you have the right to be particularly informed when you do." And I gotta say that sounds wrong, that sounds like maybe it's undermining those rights a little bit.</p>
                        <p>0:20:50.7 Michael: That'd be right.</p>
                        <p>0:20:51.5 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:20:52.4 Peter: I think it's important to say here. A little note about Lewis Powell, Justice Lewis Powell, who's writing this opinion. He used to work in education in Virginia prior to the Supreme Court, and he traveled to the Soviet Union, and upon his return was very terrified of the prospect of centralized education, and spoke to various different organizations about that. And so what he is framing as this sort of strict constitutionalist interpretation of the right to education or of the Equal Protection Clause's protection of indigent people, is in fact actually really colored quite heavily by some red scare alarm-ism that goes unspoken, and I just think it's something that when you're reading the opinion, especially if you're just... For example, in law school, reading the opinion, you would never like [0:21:45.7] ____ but this guy is absolutely being influenced by his perception that if you start to have a centralized system of education, down the road somewhere is communism.</p>
                        <p>0:22:00.0 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:22:00.4 Alec Karakatsanis: Right. And I think there's another really interesting thing going on here with the opinion, which is it does a very typical conservative move, where it says something like, "Well, if we grant that education is a fundamental right, what about the need for decent food and adequate shelter?"</p>
                        <p>0:22:14.1 Michael: Where does it stop?</p>
                        <p>0:22:15.0 Alec Karakatsanis: Because you couldn't have a good education if you're starving your child, and so it's... One might think, well, yeah, what about those things? Those things should be fundamental rights too, right?</p>
                        <p>0:22:24.4 Rhiannon: That sounds important as well, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:22:26.5 Alec Karakatsanis: And in the Supreme Court's view, the fact that there might also be other things like shelter and housing and clothing that are fundamental rights becomes a reason to reject education as a fundamental right. And this is what I, in our work, all over the country, all the time, I call the McCleskey problem, so I'm glad you guys covered McCleskey on your other podcast. This problem for me is really the guiding principle of much of the Court's modern jurisprudence, and that principle is, simply stated, that if a case threatens the existing distribution of wealth or power or the functioning of the mass incarceration bureaucracy, if a case threatens that too much, like McCleskey was really threatening the idea that we could even have this massive system of injustice because if we took racial disparities seriously, we'd have to re-think how we do everything.</p>
                        <p>0:23:14.5 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:23:15.0 Alec Karakatsanis: This case is threatening so much about how our society is structured, because if you recognize poverty as a suspect class, that the government actually has to address and do something about in real ways for people's lives, it would totally up-end the distribution of wealth in our society, and of course, the Court's not gonna allow that because the Court sees itself much more as an agent of stability and maintaining certain hierarchies of wealth and power and various norms than it does as an agent of social change.</p>
                        <p>0:23:42.8 Michael: Yeah, that's right, I think that's right. And Marshall, Justice Marshall wrote a dissent in this case that I thought was fantastic and I was struck reading it.</p>
                        <p>0:23:50.8 Peter: Before... Yeah, before we get into that, can we just take a quick break?</p>
                        <p>0:23:54.8 Michael: Alright.</p>

                        <p>0:24:58.2 Rhiannon: Thank you so much.</p>
                        <p>0:25:00.1 Michael: Yeah, thanks everybody.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:25:09.2 Michael: So Marshall's dissent, Justice Marshall wrote this dissent that I think was very comprehensive.</p>
                        <p>0:25:14.8 Rhiannon: Another dissent for the ages. It's a good one to go read if you haven't read it before.</p>
                        <p>0:25:18.7 Michael: Yeah, it very patiently and sort of methodically picks apart like every single argument the majority makes, and in the process I think reveals how sort of impoverished the majority's vision of the Constitution is. And so, Alec had mentioned that this is sort of a very formal and technical vision, and I think that's how I learned equal protection, but my professor called it the Equal Protection Architecture, because it's such an intricate analysis, for my exam, I made a flow chart.</p>
                        <p>0:25:52.3 Peter: Right, right, right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:25:53.4 Michael: It's crazy. And I think this case exemplifies how rigid that is and how much gets left out of that sort of rigid approach, whereas Marshall's dissent is far more nuanced, far more ambitious and is thinking very seriously and engaging very seriously with the individual's interests at stake and the material reality of the plaintiffs and the people in this country. And I think he has a case also that like this isn't how the Court had been treating these cases prior. He goes through and he shows that it hadn't been so rigid, this rigidity is sort of the Court's own invention in this case. Their hands aren't tied, they are tying their own hands.</p>
                        <p>0:26:38.8 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:26:39.4 Michael: And the other thought that kept coming to me is the historical moment that this case came down, Marshall mentions multiple times, Rhiannon, you mentioned earlier about minorities being more likely to live in these poorer districts. Marshall cites to Brown v. Board of Education multiple times and I kept thinking about all the racial stratification that sits beneath this. In 1973, we're 15 years into white flight, the mass exodus of white people from desegregated urban areas in response to the Civil Rights Movement, heading to very homogenous white suburbs and rural areas. We're four years removed from the passage of the Fair Housing Act.</p>
                        <p>0:27:21.8 Michael: So the effects of red lining are present in full force, which if you're not familiar with, that was a practice of literally drawing red lines around minority neighborhoods on maps and making sure those areas got fewer government benefits, were left out of private sector benefits like mortgages and had the effect of severely depressing real estate values and overall wealth of minority populations. And so of course in a case where you're looking at education being dependent on the gross property wealth of a given district, all this stuff matters, all this stuff is in play and it's all hidden, it's all behind this sort of veil and it's hard not to just see this as one piece in this larger holistic project to recreate the status quo ante before Brown v. Board, before the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
                        <p>0:28:16.6 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:28:17.8 Michael: And it makes me angry.</p>
                        <p>0:28:18.3 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:28:19.2 Peter: Something we haven't talked about in a good 50 episodes or so is affirmative action and it's back center of mind for a lot of people because there is a case pending before the Supreme Court now that many people think will be the end of affirmative action. And the basis for that will be the Equal Protection Clause, and it's just mind-boggling to take a step back and think that there is this framework that requires equal protection under the law and it is currently doing nothing to protect the poor and might end up doing quite a lot to protect wealthy white students from college admissions. The scope of the failure of the Court is just unbelievable on this front. Not only has the prospect of an Equal Protection Clause that could foster a more just world been rejected, it's been turned around and weaponized on behalf of the privileged classes.</p>
                        <p>0:29:16.6 Rhiannon: Yeah, I heard one time this professor over at Rutgers, Chenjerai Kumanyika. He referred to "the economic design of the Constitution" one time and I think that's so important to talk about. He was saying on the one hand, we know the Constitution is far from this perfect ideal document, we know the founders were slaveholders, right? We know this is fundamentally about racism in a lot of ways. But the thing about sort of just brushing it off as such, about saying, oh, yeah, they were evil and it's all evil, is that there's a sort of jurisprudential buy-in to the idea that as history progresses, things get better naturally and organically. Slavery was outlawed 100 years after the founding. So that mortal sin of how the nation was started, that's remedied, it's gone, but what that does is allow us to not really be critical of the intention of the Constitution, the sort of granular machinations of our legal structures, the fact that this was a fundamentally capitalist document, the Constitution was.</p>
                        <p>0:30:23.2 Rhiannon: And that takes away class analysis and recognition of the context in which this document, the Constitution is being drafted. This is a context in which the people who wrote that document are people who owned human beings as property and they wanted that protected. This is a context in which it was important to financial elites at the time to create a new federal government that could tax and further entrench creditor and debtor classes. These are people who were educated and wealthy as a direct result of land and property ownership and who saw themselves as better for that very fact, better morally, better genetically, better fundamentally than everybody else and it's an approach of deep skepticism for popular government, for the common person, and that was written into the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>0:31:14.8 Alec Karakatsanis: And I think that point is absolutely vital to dwell on for just a second. And to that end, I think it's really important to note two facts about the history of the Supreme Court and this opinion in particular. Number one, when I was in law school, I went and I wrote a paper and I went and read all the equal protection cases from the first 70 years after the 14th Amendment was passed and something fascinating shows up when you do that. They struck down 232 state laws under the Equal Protection Clause. Almost all of them were rulings in favor of corporations. I think it was something like 179 of them were in favor of corporations and 55 of them were in favor of the booming railroad industry at the time. Only nine cases did they rule in favor of black people, even though the whole point of the Equal Protection Clause, we were told, was to change the relationship between black people and the people who had owned them. Seven of those nine cases in favor of black people were on the single sort of technical issue about jury selection.</p>
                        <p>0:32:17.8 Alec Karakatsanis: And there were no cases in favor of women, for example. So if you look at the entire history of the Supreme Court, it has always used formal, legal, whether it's amendments or statutes or laws or rules, to preserve the basic distribution of power. And so this is a fight that we have to have I think outside the walls of the Supreme Court and then I think the thing about this opinion which is just funny in light of that history, is it was written by Lewis Powell who just two years prior to that wrote the famous Powell Memo, which if you haven't seen, I suggest you Google and read. He was a very famous corporate lawyer and right before coming on to the Court, he wrote a strategy document for how large businesses could preserve and ensure the survival of American capitalism. And it was a call to arms for corporations to dominate the political system, to assert their power, to increase inequality and to stamp out any notion of equal rights for people, and it was really a stunning document and then two years later, you have him writing this case for the US Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:33:21.7 Peter: It's interesting that you mentioned the Equal Protection Clause being used in favor of corporations so many times. I've read more than one piece of academic literature on this that was relaying that basic fact, but framed as we should really be grateful for our history of corporate personhood, because without it, the Equal Protection Clause would have never developed. And you're like, "Well, [chuckle] if we're going to be idealistic, surely, surely we could go another route with this."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:33:53.6 Rhiannon: That's so fucked.</p>
                        <p>0:33:56.8 Michael: That is... That's like back almost a year ago now. There's a basketball player, Rudy Gobert, who famously was like, "Oh, I don't think COVID's a big deal."</p>
                        <p>0:34:08.5 Rhiannon: Right. You're right.</p>
                        <p>0:34:09.1 Peter: Yeah, coughed into a mic.</p>
                        <p>0:34:09.9 Michael: He purposely coughed into a mic, and hit it and stuff. And then it turned out he had COVID and the NBA had to suspend the season, and then a lot of states started taking COVID seriously. And there were people who were like, "Look, we should all be thankful that Rudy did that."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:34:24.3 Michael: Because look how that made everybody take COVID seriously.</p>
                        <p>0:34:28.6 Peter: If any of our listeners are wondering how into basketball Michael is, now you know. He hears about the Equal Protection Clause's history, and he's like, I've got a great recent NBA metaphor.</p>
                        <p>0:34:39.1 Michael: Yes. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:34:39.5 Alec Karakatsanis: I think the opinion also does something else which is very typical of conservative judges, which is that it doesn't actually answer the question of whether poverty is a suspect class. It dodges that question in the way that Peter was describing earlier. However, Powell and his other conservative comrades, I use that word because Powell would be so offended by it.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:35:02.8 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:35:04.2 Alec Karakatsanis: His conservative comrades on the Supreme Court just a few years later issued another opinion where they cited San Antonio, but said something softer like, "We have never yet held that poverty is a suspect class under the Equal Protection Clause." And then a couple of years after that, they're just citing to those two cases, they say poverty is not a suspect class. And so in this way, they manufacture a holding, which now when you think about it, like in our bail cases around the country, conservative judges in almost every case will cite San Antonio v. Rodriguez and say poverty is not a suspect class, and so there's no problem with keeping a human being in a cage just because she can't make a payment, and they cite that case.</p>
                        <p>0:35:49.0 Alec Karakatsanis: And as Peter said, they never say that in this opinion, because there's no way to argue that that's consistent with our values. And they couldn't come right out and say it, so what do they do? They just talk around it and then later they say that they said it in the past and it becomes this historical truth, and then when you go back and peel away all the layers they actually never have.</p>
                        <p>0:36:08.1 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:36:09.2 Michael: I was just curious, and I looked at my con law outline and I had a lot of case briefs and some of them were more detailed and some were less, but for this case, it just said, "Education, not a fundamental right. Poverty, not a protected class." [chuckle] That's it. Two little lines, and that was it. That was... I was like, "This is all I need to know about this case."</p>
                        <p>0:36:25.1 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's how it's taught. In preparation for this episode, I pulled up a couple of Law Review articles, and one of them, I just read it a couple of days ago, one of them literally said, "It is black letter law in the United States that poverty is not a protected class" and black letter law means literally written down, this is the law, right, and that's just not accurate.</p>
                        <p>0:36:47.4 Peter: Yeah, and I think it speaks quite directly to how legal formalism launders itself.</p>
                        <p>0:36:53.3 Rhiannon: Yes, yes. It's a fucking scam.</p>
                        <p>0:36:56.2 Peter: Every Supreme Court case is actually like 10 sentences long, but after every sentence are 10 citations. And if you're a layperson or a law student or a young lawyer, whomever, you might think that there is almost necessarily a lot of authority baked into each sentence because you see the citations that follow it. In reality, if you started digging through them, you would realize how few of them stand for the proposition that they are intended to stand for. But they are meant to give weight and authority to the statements of the Court and give legitimacy to the whole operation. The idea that you can build these precedents on top of one another with some accuracy and reliability, that idea is being laundered through this system of citation and reference. And just the way that it is presented to the reader, I think it's important to know, especially if you're a law student.</p>
                        <p>0:37:50.6 Alec Karakatsanis: I think that's one of the key ways in which the Court manufactures this thing called the rule of law. It makes people think that there is this rule of law that is historical and supported by the weight of so many smart people that have come before us who've thought about these things. And we're taught this idea that the common law is this great enterprise where the intellectual work of prior generations builds upon itself. And then you realize that actually many of the things that we take as settled law actually were never decided by the Court at all because it would be impossible to do consistent with our values.</p>
                        <p>0:38:25.8 Alec Karakatsanis: And this myth of the rule of law, when in fact what's going on is the law is being applied for some people against some people, some of the time, in some places, for some reasons. And throughout the history of this country, that is just deeply connected to white supremacy, it's deeply connected to empire, it's deeply connected to the worst aspects of our world, and it's laundered through these formalistic legal citations and these opinions. And that to me is one of the great tragedies of this case. It took what could have been a moment where we meet our rhetoric with actual commitments to the concreteness of what it might take to help human beings flourish. We instead use it as the seminal case now, which establishes that the government has no role to play in equalizing the distribution of wealth in our society.</p>
                        <p>0:39:13.9 Michael: That's right. And I do think it's also, for all these reasons, a great example of what I think is a real failure of the mainstream legal left in legal academia, and it's this total just lack of ambition. Mainstream conservative legal thinking is constantly arguing for overturning cases they dislike. They're constantly twisting precedent, like we just described in regards to this case, to fit their own ideological needs. We discussed that process as well in our Roe v. Wade series. You see it all the time. I'm not even sure if there is a mainstream liberal or left legal project beyond maybe something like, let's try to hold on to some good decisions from the '60s. But if there is one at all, it's more interested in process-based issues, in preserving institutional legitimacy, than it is with imagining something bolder and more value-centered jurisprudence, that takes on directly cases like this one and all the awful cases we talk about.</p>
                        <p>0:40:21.5 Alec Karakatsanis: Yeah. Even the people that are on the Court that are called liberal, if you look at the last 50 years, they're mostly white, they're all fairly wealthy. First of all, they're lawyers, so they're coming from a very particular social class, with a very particular perspective. There's not a real left on the Court, or even in legal academia, because it's not really a sort of working class intersectional analysis, it's not coming out of real struggle. And so these are the representatives of the quote unquote left are mostly corporate lawyers and former prosecutors, and that has real consequences in the actual work that they do on the Court. And so we have a conservative movement that is deeply committed to very right-wing values and a quote unquote liberal movement that's mostly happy with the way our society looks, and it's just trying on the margins to preserve some of the ways in which our society is a little bit less cool. And so, we need a real movement that actually creates a real left.</p>
                        <p>0:41:20.3 Rhiannon: I think this is a good place to turn, Alec, because I am such a follower of your work and the litigation that you're bringing across the country. I think it's a really good way. We keep talking about re-imagining the world where poverty is a protected class, where the Supreme Court chose differently, in this case, in San Antonio v. Rodriguez, or a world where we do have a legal left movement that comes out of struggle, that is pushing for better and more just outcomes. And so I'd love to give you an opportunity, Alec, to just talk about the work you're doing in the cash bail area, challenging cash bail and talking about what the 14th Amendment means in that context and what...</p>
                        <p>0:42:01.7 Peter: Or could mean in that context.</p>
                        <p>0:42:03.0 Rhiannon: Right. Or could mean in that context, and how you see the sort of proactive construction of a better 14th Amendment.</p>
                        <p>0:42:12.0 Alec Karakatsanis: Wow. Yeah, that's tough. It's a hard question to think about what could be a better 14th Amendment when you look at what our judicial system looks like right now. The judicial system is dominated by people who have a very different view of the Constitution and what it could mean, and unless pretty radical change happens, we are gonna have this judicial system led by these people for the next generation or two. It's a painful exercise, thinking about what might our legal system do differently. We're litigating all over the country in many issues, but this one issue that's gotten a lot of attention is the constitutionality of the American money bail system.</p>
                        <p>0:42:56.4 Alec Karakatsanis: And really, all over the country, when people are arrested after being accused of a crime, they're told they're free to go home to their children and their families, their jobs, their school, their church, their home, if only they had cash. If they have enough cash, they can get out of jail. And not only that, but this country has privatized that system, so it's dominated by a multi-billion dollar, for-profit, commercial money bail industry, which exists only in the United States and the Philippines, a former US colony.</p>
                        <p>0:43:23.6 Alec Karakatsanis: And the idea has led to extraordinary discrimination on the basis of wealth. So there are right now about 400,000 human beings in Coronavirus-infested jail cells, in horrific conditions, where they're likely to be physically and sexually assaulted and denied adequate exercise, food, medical care, mental health treatment. The conditions inside our cages are absolutely unspeakable. I was tweeting out over the last few weeks about what it is like to be in a jail cell in Texas right now, and the unspeakable pain of being forced to be laying on top of each other, people with feces and mold and mucus and blood everywhere, and the lack of water, and this is what's going on all over the country, in every jail that we go into.</p>
                        <p>0:44:14.6 Alec Karakatsanis: And that is a consequence of the Supreme Court's decisions that people can be caged prior to trial and the decisions of courts all over the country that people deserve to be in a cage just because they don't have cash. And so we've been challenging that system under the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment for the last five or six years, and I think the cases will probably work their way up to the Supreme Court in the next six months or a year.</p>
                        <p>0:44:39.7 Michael: If you need any help on the brief...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:44:43.2 Michael: I like that laugh. The first time Alec laughs.</p>
                        <p>0:44:46.4 Rhiannon: He's like, "Oh, yeah, we're good, bro. Yeah, it sounds real good."</p>
                        <p>0:44:51.1 Alec Karakatsanis: We need all the help we can get. We're not bringing these cases as lawyers, thinking that winning in the US Supreme Court is a panacea. The Supreme Court long ago held that police need probable cause to stop someone, arrest them and search them, and yet that happens millions of times a year, people are arrested and searched without probable cause. The Constitution is not self-executing, and so we're not under any illusions that winning in the Supreme Court would really mean anything.</p>
                        <p>0:45:16.2 Alec Karakatsanis: I think we see these cases more as a way of changing the narrative in our society, in our culture, about what these institutions do, what they are, undermining people's faith in them by asking a simple question: If Sandra Bland can be left to die in a jail cell because she couldn't afford a few hundred dollars, if Kalief Browder spends years on Rikers Island because he can't pay cash, if this legal system is making the decision about who's in a cage and who's free with their family, on the basis of how much cash is in their pocket, what else is it doing? And how can we trust anything that it's doing?</p>
                        <p>0:45:49.0 Alec Karakatsanis: I see these cases as undermining some of the faith that the legal establishment bureaucracy needs to survive and to keep inflicting all this harm, and so I think these cases are a very small part of a much broader movement that is really led by the people that are most harmed by these systems, trying to change the way we all think about them, rather than depending on one particular ruling from one particular court.</p>
                        <p>0:46:12.4 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:46:12.7 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:46:13.4 Michael: Beautiful.</p>
                        <p>0:46:14.6 Peter: We've often talked about the... And talked on this episode about the turning point of the Court's jurisprudence that took place, primarily starting in the 1970s. The prior Court, though, the Warren Court, had sort of begun the process of embracing, enfolding more modern understandings of equality, modern understandings of social science into their jurisprudence, and when the conservatives regained control of the Court in the '70s, they started to push back against that. And Justice Powell writes about this in expressly reactionary terms, basically saying, as Alec mentioned, if we change this, how much change is down the road? Just inherently taking the position that change is dangerous.</p>
                        <p>0:46:52.4 Peter: It can't be overstated how badly the last 50 years of jurisprudence and legal theory poisoned the minds of everyone in our profession. And I think this discussion was valuable, because if you are learning the law in America, how you conceptualize it is colored by the narrow, formalistic framework that is built atop the foundation of reaction that happened in the early 1970s, especially. The conservative view of poverty has always been, in some form or another, that it is inevitable that society will divide into winners and losers and there is nothing you can do about that. But the law doesn't need to accept that. The law doesn't need to accept the status quo. The law could protect the weak, it could force the status quo to justify itself.</p>
                        <p>0:47:40.6 Peter: Lawyers would tell you that having poverty be a protected class is a pipe dream. And my response to that would be, we live in a world where the Court has, just for example, picking one thing, stretched itself remarkably thin to protect the rights of corporations to engage in arbitration. You shouldn't feel like a dreamer for imagining a world where it gave poor people the right to go to better schools. That world is right there in front of us.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:48:06.7 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:48:07.3 Peter: It's not far away. And a lot of what Powell does in this opinion is sort of devolve into abstraction. But this isn't a particularly abstract issue. Funding education is quite simple. It drives results up, it increases graduation rates and decreases dropout rates and increases wages for adults who had higher levels of funding. Those aren't abstractions. Those are real, concrete ways to help poorer students across the country. And the idea that this is somehow out of reach, out of bounds for a constitutional analysis is ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>0:48:42.7 Rhiannon: It's a choice.</p>
                        <p>0:48:44.9 Peter: It is.</p>
                        <p>0:48:45.5 Alec Karakatsanis: One final point as we've been talking that just occurred to me, and there's all these debates now about to what extent more spending on education gets results. And I think that one of the things that I've noticed from conversations all over the country with our clients and their children and families is that schools in areas that have trouble meeting basic funding, they are the first to lose things like music and theater and sports and poetry and other kinds of experiences that I think are very central to the cultivation and development of not only a flourishing life and a beautiful life, but also a life that can dream and that can vision out a different world, and a life that resists and understands how to communicate in ways that are maybe different from standardized tests.</p>
                        <p>0:49:43.5 Alec Karakatsanis: And I think that one of the projects of both liberal and conservative elites in this country has been to starve the education system to a point where all we can think about with the education system is meeting very minimal standards and needs, and instead of thinking about, how do we create incredible people who can dream and who have all of the basic needs met so that they can do what makes all of the things that many very privileged people take for granted about the best aspects of life? Totally beyond my area of expertise and probably very silly, but it strikes me that a lot of these cases and their discussions about this have created a world that is so starved for basic resources that we're not even fighting about the really profound things that we really should be talking about with education, and we're stuck fighting on the most basic things that you would think and hope that a civilization like ours would have confronted a long time ago.</p>
                        <p>0:50:42.3 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:50:42.5 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:50:42.9 Rhiannon: Gorgeous.</p>
                        <p>0:50:44.8 Peter: Yeah, it's a good place to leave it. Alec Karakatsanis, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
                        <p>0:50:49.0 Michael: Yeah, thank you.</p>

                        <p>0:50:56.1 Peter: We can stop being on this podcast so much if we can start cycling in more guests.</p>

                        <p>0:51:00.2 Alec Karakatsanis: It was really fun. Thank you all.</p>
                        <p>0:51:02.8 Peter: Next week, Toyota v. Williams, a case about disability law. You know where this is going. It's not good.</p>
                        <p>0:51:11.2 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>

                        <p>0:00:02.0 S?: We'll hear argument now in number 99-5, United States v. Antonio J. Morrison.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:00:09.6 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about US v. Morrison, a case about the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. The case is also about the Interstate Commerce Clause and whether the billions of dollars the US economy loses because of gender-based violence should count as commerce. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court said no, making it impossible for victims of gender-based violence to sue for damages in federal court.</p>
                        <p>0:00:40.4 S?: Congress enacted the Civil Rights remedy of the Violence Against Women Act to remove one of the most persistent barriers to women's full equality and free participation in the economy, discriminatory gender-based violence.</p>
                        <p>0:00:54.2 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:01:06.5 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have caused our freedoms to fade away like the colors of a painting in the sunlight. I am Peter, here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:20.6 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:20.5 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:20.6 Rhiannon: Hi, hello.</p>
                        <p>0:01:22.0 Peter: I thought that intro was strangely beautiful.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:01:26.7 Rhiannon: Interesting that you say it about your own writing, but... Yeah, sure.</p>
                        <p>0:01:29.8 Michael: Very strong imagery.</p>
                        <p>0:01:31.6 Peter: That's right. Today's case is US v. Morrison. This is the case about the Commerce Clause, but also violence against women. This is a case about the intersection of commerce and violence against women, and we will clarify momentarily. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act, a bill co-sponsored by Joe Biden that provided funding for the investigation and prosecution of domestic violence and allowed victims of domestic violence to sue for money damages in federal court. There is one thing you have to understand about the Constitution for this case. The federal government can only do things the Constitution specifically says it can do, so every time Congress passes a law, it has to explain in the law, where in the Constitution it says that they have the power to pass that law.</p>
                        <p>0:02:28.5 Peter: One thing that the Constitution says Congress can do is "Regulate commerce among the several states." This is known as the Interstate Commerce Clause, or just the Commerce Clause. The idea is very simple, if something concerns the economy of one state, that's the state's business and the federal government can't pass laws about it, but if something concerns the economies of multiple states, then that is a federal issue, makes sense? Should be simple enough.</p>
                        <p>0:02:53.9 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>0:02:54.9 Peter: The idea is that as soon as economic activity crosses state lines, it's now a federal concern that can be regulated by the federal government, but the contours of this have been a legal battleground for many years, because especially as economies have grown more complex and expanded, it's become less and less clear when economic activity can be said to occur solely within a state as opposed to among multiple states. And conservatives who do not want to see a powerful federal government have long been arguing that we should read this very narrowly so that Congress cannot pass too many sweeping laws.</p>
                        <p>0:03:32.5 Peter: This case is one of the many times the conservatives on the Court have made up a new and arbitrary rule to try to limit the ability of Congress to legislate, with the goal of hampering progressive legislation. So we're going to talk about the Violence Against Women Act, what Congress is trying to do and how the Court interferes, and we're also going to talk about this much bigger picture concept about the scope of the federal government's power under the Commerce Clause, which is a trip into one of the most heated, pedantic and pseudo-academic debates in the legal world.</p>
                        <p>0:04:07.6 Michael: I'm excited, guys, this is like my wheel house.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:04:12.8 Rhiannon: Michael's got something to say.</p>
                        <p>0:04:14.6 Peter: So one note we should make here up top is that the connection between violence against women and the Commerce Clause, it's obviously not really intuitive if you're not a lawyer, but bear with us. We will get you there. The gist of it is that gendered violence drives down women's participation in the economy and costs the economy billions of dollars a year. Women turn down jobs because of the threat of violence, they miss out as consumers because of partners who control their finances, on and on and on, and the scope of the impact of all this gendered violence crosses state lines. All of this was documented by Congress and used as their justification for passing the law. We will give this a little more color as we go on.</p>
                        <p>0:05:02.6 Rhiannon: Right. So VAWA, like Peter said, was passed in 1994.</p>
                        <p>0:05:07.1 Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Can't just bust out an acronym like that...</p>
                        <p>0:05:10.3 Rhiannon: I thought you said it.</p>
                        <p>0:05:11.3 Peter: I didn't say VAWA, I'm not in the know like that.</p>
                        <p>0:05:15.8 Rhiannon: Okay, so VAWA, which is the Violence Against Women Act, like Peter said, was passed in 1994, and it was actually passed after more than four years of congressional deliberation with numerous hearings and fact-finding proceedings leading up to passing the law. And this was congressional deliberation that explored the national problem of violence against women. In passing VAWA, Congress called domestic violence "a national tragedy played out every day in the lives of millions of American women at home, in the workplace and on the street." And so the law contained multiple provisions that were aimed at addressing violence against women in the United States.</p>
                        <p>0:05:58.2 Rhiannon: For example, between 1994 and the year 2000, the law provided $1.6 billion to fund a range of programs, including improving victim services, creating a National Domestic Violence hotline, and new initiatives to improve law enforcement's response to crimes like domestic violence and sexual assault. It created new federal felonies to address acts of interstate violence, and it had provisions to support immigrant women who were victims of domestic violence, it helped them in obtaining legal status, and then there were also research provisions to advance our national understanding of domestic violence and gender-based violence in the US.</p>
                        <p>0:06:42.8 Michael: Sounds like a pretty good law.</p>
                        <p>0:06:44.9 Rhiannon: Yeah, it was complicated, for sure. Complicated and comprehensive.</p>
                        <p>0:06:49.2 Peter: Yeah, Joe Biden, of course, co-sponsored the bill, and he famously said, "Come on, man. We need a law," you know.</p>
                        <p>0:06:57.6 Michael: No more of this domestic violence malarkey.</p>
                        <p>0:07:02.1 Rhiannon: Boys, they're doing malarkey.</p>
                        <p>0:07:03.8 Peter: Women across the country, I mean, come on.</p>
                        <p>0:07:07.7 Rhiannon: Again, thank you so much, Joe Biden. So the provision of VAWA that's at issue in this case provided for a civil cause of action for victims of gender-based violence in federal court. What that means in plain English is if you were a victim of gender-based violence, you could sue the perpetrator of that violence for damages, and that was even if no criminal charges had been filed against that person. And just want to note here that Congress carefully drafted and articulated all of these provisions in much the same way that Congress drafts lots of Civil Rights legislation, with an eye towards targeting only specific behavior that is clearly discriminatory, and it did so after hearing tons of testimony about the way violence against women interfere with women's full participation in the economy and public life, and it did so after hearing about the discriminatory manner in which states have treated gender-based claims historically.</p>
                        <p>0:08:10.2 Rhiannon: So Congress concluded after all of this testimony, after all of the fact-finding, that states weren't doing a good enough job at addressing gender-based violence, and so it created this cause of action. So we have that sort of statutory background that's the status of the law at this time, so turning to the facts of this specific case. What happened was just months after VAWA was passed and enacted in the fall of 1994, a freshman at Virginia Tech named Christy Brzonkala reported that she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by two fellow students, Antonio Morrison and James Crawford.</p>
                        <p>0:08:48.5 Rhiannon: Morrison and Crawford were members of Virginia Tech football team, and according to Christy Brzonkala's reports, they gang-raped her in her dorm room some 30 minutes after the three of them met for the very first time.</p>
                        <p>0:09:01.5 Michael: Jesus.</p>
                        <p>0:09:02.9 Rhiannon: And so she reported this sexual assault to the school, and Virginia Tech conducted disciplinary hearings. As a result of those school-led hearings, Morrison was suspended and Crawford ended up not being disciplined. Actually, in fact, eventually after an appeal, Morrison's suspension was overturned. Local law enforcement didn't really do anything with Brzonkala's report either, a grand jury did not indict them for criminal charges, so no criminal charges were filed against either Morrison or Crawford, and meanwhile, Brzonkala became increasingly depressed and in fact she attempted to commit suicide. Eventually she withdrew from Virginia Tech, and with no help or support from local law enforcement or the school, Brzonkala eventually filed suit in federal court.</p>
                        <p>0:09:57.3 Rhiannon: Now, she brings two cases: She sued Virginia Tech, the school, under Title 9, and we won't discuss that here, that's a different case, it's a different law, but she also sued Morrison and Crawford individually under this new provision of VAWA that had just been enacted. So when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Brzonkala's case, they said that her lawsuit couldn't go forward because this part of VAWA was unconstitutional. And Brzonkala appealed to Supreme Court. You'll notice that the case is called the US v. Morrison, that's because the federal government actually intervened to defend VAWA, so they became a party to the case, and that's how you get US v. Morrison.</p>
                        <p>0:10:41.5 Peter: So Congress has passed the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, which allows women to sue in federal court, and they say that they had the power to do this, to pass this law, because the Constitution allows them to regulate interstate commerce, and as their law explains in detail, violence against women has a widespread impact that substantially affects interstate commerce. For example, you have the various ways in which domestic violence impacts women's ability to find employment or to engage in the workforce, and it impacts their productivity. These are all things that we'll talk about in a bit that Congress finds, but the Supreme Court says, no, you can't do that, because violence against women isn't itself really economic activity, it's not really commerce, and so that doesn't count as something you can regulate.</p>
                        <p>0:11:31.1 Peter: I want to also note, there's an Equal Protection argument, Congress says that they also have the power to pass this under the Equal Protection argument. We'll touch on this later. It's a complex and academic topic, but I don't want the nerds to think that I'm ignoring it, we're going to get to get to it, we'll get to it at the end, right. Relax.</p>
                        <p>0:11:47.3 Rhiannon: Do not yell at us.</p>
                        <p>0:11:49.1 Michael: Or we'll yell back.</p>
                        <p>0:11:50.4 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:11:51.6 Michael: You are like that.</p>
                        <p>0:11:52.0 Peter: So to make sure we're all on the same page here, the Constitution again has this clause called the Commerce Clause, and basically the rule, the legal rule is that the states can regulate economic activity that happens in their states, but if there's economic activity that happens across multiple states, then the federal government regulates that. But what exactly it means for commerce to be taking place solely in a state as opposed to in multiple states has become less clear as economies have become more complex. Back in the day, it might have been relatively simple. At the time of the Founding, there were two basic types of businesses, agriculture and prostitution, and this is not based on a lot of research, I'm just kind of eye-balling this.</p>
                        <p>0:12:37.9 Peter: So there would be a guy in your town with a beef steak tomato farm, and he would go to the town center to sell them, and you would buy 14 of them so that each member of your family, which had 14 people in it, could eat a single beef steak tomato for dinner and...</p>
                        <p>0:12:51.5 Michael: The farmer could sleep with a prostitute.</p>
                        <p>0:12:54.9 Peter: And the farmer would use that money to go to the brothel or the house of ill repute nearby, and he would have sex with a prostitute. All of that is happening entirely within your state, so the federal government can't regulate that, but if the tomato farmer crosses state lines to sell his tomatoes, then the federal government is allowed to regulate that. Same applies to your basic prosecuting operations.</p>
                        <p>0:13:21.0 Peter: So think about that tomato transaction now. You go to a grocery store to buy a tomato. That grocery store's headquarters is probably in another state, it probably has operations across multiple states, it probably uses technology that sends data across multiple states. The workers might cross state lines to get to work depending on where you are. The tomato itself has almost certainly crossed a state border. The development of the economy has meant that people and things and information are crossing state lines all the time, and what that means is that as the economy has developed, the federal government's power to regulate the economy has grown.</p>
                        <p>0:13:57.6 Michael: Right, right. And so in the '30s, the New Deal had resulted in all sorts of new federal laws, the Supreme Court started striking some of them down, claiming that the federal government was exceeding its power to regulate interstate commerce. In 1936, the Court struck down federal regulations on mining, saying that mining was not commerce, even though the commodity being mined was going to be sold across state lines. That seems maybe a little pedantic, but conservatives at the time were really concerned about the size of the federal government during the New Deal and how it was going to explode, and they were looking for anything they could find to rein that in.</p>
                        <p>0:14:41.9 Michael: And so that's, FDR as a result starts applying political pressure to the Court, he threatens to pack it with more Justices in order to preserve his legislation.</p>
                        <p>0:14:52.7 Peter: That's right. Get their asses, bro.</p>
                        <p>0:14:54.7 Michael: Yeah, that's right. Pack the courts.</p>
                        <p>0:14:57.1 Rhiannon: How's a little political power feel, huh?</p>
                        <p>0:15:00.5 Michael: Good positive history in our country. And Court bent to that pressure. In a case called NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel, the Court held that the federal government could regulate activities that had a substantial effect on interstate commerce, so not necessarily just like that transaction, but like anything that affects interstate commerce. And then for many decades after, basically up until this case, and maybe just a few years before, there were just no decisions limiting the federal government's power under the Commerce Clause, but during much of that time, the conservative legal movement was being built from the ground up, and they were mad as hell about the fact that the federal government could regulate anything that impacts commerce, even if it's sort of indirectly so.</p>
                        <p>0:15:52.5 Michael: They didn't like seeing the federal government handed the keys to all this power, and especially since this power that's historically been used to pass progressive legislation, right.</p>
                        <p>0:16:05.6 Peter: So the sort of next part of this story is that in 1990, the federal government passes a law about gun violence, and they argue that their power to pass that law comes from the fact that gun violence impacts commerce between the states and in 1995, for the first time in nearly 60 years, the Supreme Court strikes down a federal law under the Commerce Clause. And that gets the ball rolling here, right, the first blow struck by the nascent conservative legal movement against the power of the federal government under the Commerce Clause. And that brings us here to this case.</p>
                        <p>0:16:39.1 Rhiannon: Guys, I just feel like I'm really being brought back to 1L con law, this is a blast from the past, all these cases that we're talking about. Did you guys spend half of con law talking about the Commerce Clause?</p>
                        <p>0:16:54.9 Michael: Yeah, my con law was mainly Commerce Clause and Equal Protection, Fourth Amendment fundamental rights stuff.</p>
                        <p>0:17:01.8 Peter: I zoned out for most of con law. I'm good at studying. The last two weeks were all I needed, I would really pack it in, so I don't really remember what the discussions were throughout the year, unfortunately.</p>
                        <p>0:17:13.0 Rhiannon: That's great. Peter went to an Ivy law school... Went to an Ivy law school and does not remember discussions had, which I think is beautiful, and that's why he's the Law Boy.</p>
                        <p>0:17:26.2 Peter: I remember the vibes, though, I remember the vibes.</p>
                        <p>0:17:30.6 Michael: There was a Yale law grad on Twitter who was marveling at the fact that the bottle of shampoo he purchased in use for months was dog shampoo, and the only indication of that was the fact that there was a large photo of a dog on the bottle.</p>
                        <p>0:17:49.8 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's why Ivy grads are stupid. I like that, alright.</p>
                        <p>0:17:54.0 Michael: Yeah, let's not give Ivy law grads too much credit here.</p>
                        <p>0:17:58.2 Peter: Yeah, but he probably graduated towards the top of his class. That's the thing is, if you're at a top school and you go to the top of the class, those kids are freaks, alright, those kids are weird as hell. You gotta go down towards the middle, alright, for the cool kids. That's where I was, just hovering with the masses, man of the people.</p>
                        <p>0:18:19.2 Rhiannon: Keep telling yourself that, buddy. Yup.</p>
                        <p>0:18:21.3 Peter: Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry, Rhi, I forgot that you went to an everyman law school, that everyone can get into.</p>
                        <p>0:18:28.5 Rhiannon: Shut up. Shut up.</p>
                        <p>0:18:31.7 Michael: A friend told me a story once about how there was a kid in her law school class who would bring a Snickers bar into every exam and he would cut it into thirds, I think it was, or quarters, and then every 30 minutes or whatever, he would eat one piece of it.</p>
                        <p>0:18:48.7 Peter: Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>0:18:51.8 Michael: Yeah, the punchline of the story was that he ended up with Supreme Court clerkship, so...</p>
                        <p>0:18:52.7 Peter: Yeah. Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>0:18:57.4 Michael: That's the elite, the legal elite.</p>
                        <p>0:19:00.0 Peter: By comparison, my last 1L final, I brought whiskey and I poured it like three quarters of the way through the exam, and I was like, I'll be fine.</p>
                        <p>0:19:11.9 Peter: Alright, we are now in the year 2000, this case. Congress has passed this law designed to combat violence against women, which gives them the right to sue in federal court. Like I mentioned, when Congress passes a law, it needs to point out what part of the Constitution gives it the authority to pass that law, and they claimed that their constitutional authority derives from the Commerce Clause and their power to regulate interstate commerce. What they say is that violence against women has a significant impact on commerce, and they submit a massive amount of evidence to support that.</p>
                        <p>0:19:44.1 Michael: Right. So just to cut in, Rhiannon said that Congress spent four years developing this and holding hearings, and just to go over some of their findings, sort of substantiating this link between gendered violence and interstate commerce, they found that it's like billions of dollars a year in lost productivity and wages, for a variety of reasons. 50% of rape victims end up losing their jobs, the ones who keep their jobs have decreased productivity, victims of domestic violence likewise have lots of absenteeism and sick time because either they can't leave their homes or they don't want to go into work because the bruises and the cuts from the domestic violence are visible and they want to hide it.</p>
                        <p>0:20:37.2 Michael: On top of that, even women who were not themselves victims of gendered violence nonetheless have it shape their participation in the economy because they'll turn down better paying night jobs or jobs in the areas of heightened risk, which Congress found were justified fears, that later hours or working downtown or whatever, you're more likely to be the victim of gendered violence. So it's just massive, the impact gendered violence has on the economy was just demonstrably massive.</p>
                        <p>0:21:11.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's hard to even come up with words for how sort of everyday and pernicious gender-based violence is, and I think it's important to highlight that whether or not you think VAWA and all of its provisions were very good at addressing gender-based violence, I have my own views about, say, sending a bunch of funding to local law enforcement and saying that police should handle domestic violence cases in specific ways, but it was Congress looking at this issue for a long time and realizing how bad, how massive the impact is on the nation's economy and trying to address that with a sort of comprehensive legislative scheme that would allow women in different ways to combat the reality of living in a rape culture and a culture sort of built on the oppression of non-men.</p>
                        <p>0:22:09.0 Peter: I think, to agree, this is sort of common sense. Of course, being the victim of discrete acts of violence or continued acts of violence is going to impact the degree to which you are engaging with the workforce or the broader economy, right, that does feel to me like common sense, and it's backed up by hard data. So basically, Congress saying that even though they are not regulating commerce directly through VAWA, they're regulating it indirectly. And the Supreme Court rejects this in a 5-4 opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist.</p>
                        <p>0:22:43.0 Peter: The legal rule created by earlier Supreme Court decisions is that if something "substantially affects" interstate commerce, then Congress can regulate, even if it's not commerce itself. And the Court can't say that violence against women doesn't substantially affect interstate commerce, because Congress has a huge amount of evidence that it does. So what they say is, look, violence against women is not economic activity, and so it's not covered by the Commerce Clause. Specifically, Rehnquist says, "Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not in any sense of the phrase economic activity."</p>
                        <p>0:23:27.6 Michael: It's a shame that Congress tried to pass this law under the Economic Activity Clause.</p>
                        <p>0:23:35.9 Peter: The first thing to note here is that that's not the rule. The rule is supposed to be that Congress can regulate things that substantially affect interstate commerce. The Rehnquist Court has made up the economic activity versus non-economic activity distinction. But more importantly, and more essential to the issue here, the idea that gender-motivated crimes are not "in any sense of the phrase economic activity" is something that just about any fucking honest economist will tell you is incorrect. Everything you do has an implied cost and a nominal impact on the economy. Whether or not someone is directly engaged in the exchange of money for goods and services, they are essentially always, or at least often engaged in the economy in some material way.</p>
                        <p>0:24:23.2 Peter: I'm not saying Congress should be able to regulate everything, the rule is that there must be a substantial impact on interstate commerce, but at the very least, there is no clear distinction between what you might call economic activity and non-economic activity. If someone obstructs a highway, which prevents people from getting to work or conducting business, can Congress step in and regulate that? Yes, because the highway is what the law calls a channel of interstate commerce, which everyone agrees they can regulate, and yet when domestic violence prevents people from working or conducting business, that is somehow according to the conservatives on the Court non-economic activity. Yeah, the distinction is meaningless, and the Court's made up rule is just pure sophistry, it is the output of a conservative legal movement that has been desperate to create some sort of rule that would limit the federal government's power, and after failing to come up with something good settled for this contrived bullshit that sounds like the most obviously incorrect multiple choice answer on a bar exam.</p>
                        <p>0:25:33.3 Michael: Right. And I think the facts of this case are a great example of how bullshit it is, because going to college is absolutely economic activity, it totally determines how and whether you can participate in the economy. And this woman dropped out of college as a result of this. Whether or not you're depressed impacts whether and how you can participate in the economy, and she became seriously depressed, right, suicidal. That is incapacitating. This is a person who has been effectively taken out of the workforce for some indeterminate amount of time, and when she re-enters is going to be in a substantially different economic position because of where her education stopped.</p>
                        <p>0:26:22.4 Michael: That is economic. There's just no way around it. And like this is such bullshit on their part too, 'cause it's like, it's just not their job. The Supreme Court does not do fact-finding, it's like the last thing they're supposed to do, and it's so dishonest, they quote themselves saying, look, simply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so. But that case, first of all that's bullshit, but that case they were talking about when Congress had no findings at all.</p>
                        <p>0:26:58.6 Peter: And I want to give a little bit of color here, because in the prior case that, the Lopez case from 1995 about gun violence, Congress hadn't submitted any evidence that linked commerce to gun regulation. They just said, well, it impacts it, right, and that's why in this case, they submitted a huge amount. And Rehnquist is like, no, I don't think so, though.</p>
                        <p>0:27:18.9 Michael: Yeah, that quote makes sense in the context of that case because that was a law where Congress hadn't submitted extensive findings, and so it's like, yeah, if Congress just says this impacts commerce and doesn't back it up at all, sure, the Court might disagree, but that's not the case here. The case here is that Congress had substantial, like overwhelming evidence that this greatly impact interstate commerce, and the Court was just like, nah. And this is like... We've seen this in other cases we've discussed, in Shelby County v. Holder with the Voting Rights Act, where Congress submitted months of finding from hearings and studies and all this, thousands of pages about why their formula was correct, and the Supreme Court was like, no, I just disagree.</p>
                        <p>0:28:08.2 Michael: And it's just the height of judicial activism, it's the height of judicial law-making, of usurping Congress's role in legislating. And we talk about the importance of recognizing that courts do that, but it's just so important to call out when the conservatives who supposedly hate that stuff are engaging in it so egregiously, which they are here.</p>
                        <p>0:28:34.6 Rhiannon: Right, exactly, and I think this case also shows how the Rehnquist Court viewed violence against women like this exclusively domestic, private issue rather than a society-wide problem that warrants public government involvement, which is what Congress showed. Like Michael, you talked about the facts of Christy Brzonkala's case showing that absolutely she was participating in economic activity, and how gender-based violence took her out of that economic activity.</p>
                        <p>0:29:07.8 Rhiannon: What Congress did in passing the law and holding all of these hearings was showing how widespread exactly Christy Brzonkala's case was, that it was happening across the country and having a significant impact on the economy. And so the perspective from the Rehnquist Court that violence against women is just like this private matter that happens at home, that's significant because it influences how federal and state powers work together on an issue. Like if something is a purely domestic issue, if it's purely a private problem or at most a problem that is already addressed by state criminal law or local law enforcement, then that's not an issue that the federal government has the power to regulate or influence, that's outside the scope of the federal government's power and Congress's law-making ability, sure.</p>
                        <p>0:30:00.5 Rhiannon: But it's important to highlight, but this is a misogynistic viewpoint to deny how widespread and toxic and deeply pernicious violence against women is, and that's what's predicating this argument about federal versus state power. In minimizing how damaging and dangerous the reality of domestic violence is, the Supreme Court sort of gets to shoe horn in this conservative viewpoint on federalism.</p>
                        <p>0:30:26.1 Michael: Yeah, no, I think that's exactly right, Rhi. And I think it's very endemic to the conservative world view, where they sort of reject systemic explanations and systemic approaches to things and try to make everything this atomized, individual inquiry, like racism is a question of what's in your heart. And it's something you see consistently across sort of domains in conservative legal thinking, and so you see it here where like domestic violence, the idea that that's some big nationwide issue, like a larger cultural institutional issue that requires big legislation to ameliorate and to fix is just something that they flatly reject.</p>
                        <p>0:31:18.4 Peter: It's a core tenet of conservative politics that you reject the structural problem and re-frame it as an individualized problem. It's like unemployment, right, when unemployment spikes, is that a structural problem that needs to be addressed with broad sweeping legislation? No, no, no. It's lazy people.</p>
                        <p>0:31:38.7 Michael: Right. And the environment is like, turn off your lights and recycle, not like we need to regulate companies and make sure that they're using...</p>
                        <p>0:31:49.5 Peter: Exactly. And racism, is it something that needs to be addressed with something big, like maybe reparations or something that looks like that? No, no, it's just get your vibes right, bro. Just sort of reframe your vibes and you'll be good. So again, we have the conservative Court here saying that Congress can't regulate domestic violence in this way by making up this sort of fictional distinction between economic and non-economic activity, and they're saying, well, domestic violence, that's non-economic activity.</p>
                        <p>0:32:21.0 Peter: And the fact that the conservatives essentially made up a new and arbitrary rule to limit the power of the federal government to pass laws, very telling. The Constitution says that the feds can regulate commerce between the states; like I mentioned back in the day, that might have meant only a few things, but in the modern economy, it means a huge amount, people, goods, data, all crossing state lines constantly. And that means that the federal government's power has grown, and conservatives don't like this, because historically, the feds have used that power to pass progressive legislation.</p>
                        <p>0:32:56.0 Peter: But that's not an actual constitutional reason to strike laws down. They're just frustrated with the reality here, the reality of the implications of the Commerce Clause. And so they're engaging in what they claim to hate, traditional policy-making. And this opinion is rife with it. Rehnquist is basically saying, well, look, if the federal government can regulate everything that substantially impacts commerce, they're going to have too much power. And it's like, well, that's not really your job to decide, that's not the Court's role.</p>
                        <p>0:33:27.9 Peter: How many times have we heard the conservatives basically say, well, whether or not this is good policy is irrelevant. Our job is just to correctly interpret the Constitution. And yet here they are, oddly rejecting that train of thought when the outcome is something that benefits the left. They're actively doing living constitutionalism, the very thing that originalists claim to hate. Living constitutionalism is the idea that our understanding of what the Constitution means should evolve over time. That's what they're doing here. The bottom line is they're saying, look, the social context has changed enough that we shouldn't read the Constitution so literally, which I don't find to be in and of itself particularly offensive, but I'd like to see them admit what they're doing.</p>
                        <p>0:34:11.6 Rhiannon: Right, just be real about it.</p>
                        <p>0:34:13.2 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:34:14.5 Peter: I also want to point out some of the historical context for their opposition to federal power under the Commerce Clause. 'Cause I think you can think about like, well, interstate commerce, it all seems maybe a little bit abstruse, maybe a little bit like I don't know how much this matters. In 1964, there was a case called Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States. That was a case where hotel owners in the South who wanted to discriminate against black people in their business sued the federal government saying that they did not have the power under the Constitution, under the Commerce Clause to pass the Civil Rights Act. Part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a law saying that places of public accommodation such as hotels could not discriminate on the basis of race. And Congress said their power to do that was found in the Commerce Clause. Hotels, they accept people that have been traveling between states and therefore they could be regulated under the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce.</p>
                        <p>0:35:09.0 Peter: And the Supreme Court agreed, upholding that pivotal civil rights legislation. And conservatives quietly bristled, maybe not so quietly at the time, but they're a little quieter about it these days. They didn't want the federal government using its commerce power to pass what they view as sort of socially progressive legislation. And the same thing is happening here, the conservatives are upset that the government is passing socially liberal legislation, and they're trying to throw as many wrenches at it as possible.</p>
                        <p>0:35:40.5 Rhiannon: Yes. And I think it's important to talk about the impact of US v. Morrison on women and what remedies were left for victims of gender-based violence if this provision of the law was deemed unconstitutional. I think a lot of people have rightly pointed out that the case has a much bigger impact really on Congress's ability to pass laws under the Commerce Clause, rather than just taking away all of the remedies available to these victims. And that's because states have their own statutory schemes addressing gender-based violence. Depending on what state you're in, you can sue in state court. And certainly, there are state criminal laws that have been beefed up to address domestic violence more seriously.</p>
                        <p>0:36:24.5 Rhiannon: But I do think there's discussion to be had about what it means to women to treat gender-based violence as a violation of your civil rights. And that's what this provision of VAWA was passed as. This is very similar and mirrors Civil Rights legislation, like Peter was just talking about. One of the ways that we show as a society that we are taking a problem seriously is by enacting legal accountability. It's symbolically and culturally important to have laws that address problems because it shows that sort of government and stakeholders and everybody are taking the problems that citizens face seriously. It's saying gender-based violence is incredibly degrading and dangerous, and because that is so, you have this legal accountability mechanism. You can go to federal court and get damages for the harm that you have experienced. And I think that impact is significant, that we don't have that because it shows the Court is not taking this problem seriously.</p>
                        <p>0:37:34.5 Rhiannon: The legislative history for VAWA as a Civil Rights remedy shows that Congress was responding to the effect of discriminatory, gender-based violence on women's full participation in commerce. For example, documented in this legislative history was that gender-based violence deters women's movement. It keeps them from walking at night, even in their own neighborhoods. It restricts their use of public transportation, which limits where and when they'll travel. There was documentation that gender-based violence reduces consumer spending, showing that women, for example, don't go to movies alone after dark.</p>
                        <p>0:38:15.2 Rhiannon: And just like the impact of race discrimination on racial minorities in their choice of jobs, Congress also documented in passing VAWA that gender-based violence deters women from taking jobs in certain areas or at certain hours, like Michael said earlier. And so overall, this is like this broad conclusion that gender-based crimes and fear of those crimes restricts movement, reduces employment opportunities and reduces consumer spending. And so, as a woman, you think, okay, what is my remedy for that happening to me? If my movement has been restricted, if my employment opportunities have been restricted, if my consumer spending and participation in the economy like I please, if that has been limited because of gender-based violence, because of this discriminatory violence against me, where is my remedy? What law allows me to sue for that, right?</p>
                        <p>0:39:09.5 Rhiannon: And so, I think it's important to just highlight that, yes, while there are other remedies available, like criminal law or state statutory schemes for being made whole after suffering gender-based violence, I think the impact in this provision of VAWA being found unconstitutional is really in what it demonstrates about our government and the society not taking this seriously.</p>
                        <p>0:39:35.8 Michael: Right. And it's worth mentioning that part of the motivation and part of the congressional findings behind this law was that those alternative remedies often are no remedy at all.</p>
                        <p>0:39:47.0 Rhiannon: Yes, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:39:48.6 Michael: That the same biases that create gendered violence in the first place are also endemic among police officers, among prosecutors, among judges and juries and court employees and everyone, and so those remedies don't become available. There was a Senate report in 1991 that said study after study commissioned by the highest courts of the states, over 20 states from Florida to New York, California to New Jersey, Nevada to Minnesota, has concluded that crimes disproportionately affecting women are treated less seriously than comparable crimes against men. And further, that collectively, these reports provide overwhelming evidence that gender bias permeates the courts system and that women are most often its victims. And so I think it's fair to say that this Supreme Court case, rather than engaging with those facts, is like an example of that bias.</p>
                        <p>0:40:51.5 Rhiannon: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>0:40:51.5 Michael: This is that same permeating discrimination that sort of downplays the harms and impacts of gendered violence.</p>
                        <p>0:41:00.7 Rhiannon: Right, right. And that's exactly what Congress was trying to point out. But yet again, in this case, you have the Court stepping in and sort of claiming expertise where they don't have any and denying this really extensive fact-finding.</p>
                        <p>0:41:13.1 Michael: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:41:15.5 Peter: Although to be fair, William Rehnquist might have a kind of expertise in domestic violence...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:41:24.1 Michael: Yes. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:41:24.2 Rhiannon: It doesn't matter 'cause that motherfucker is dead.</p>
                        <p>0:41:26.0 Peter: That's right. To the lawyers of his estate, I said "might."</p>
                        <p>[laughter.</p>
                        <p>0:41:33.8 Peter: There's also a much bigger picture issue here. The impact of this case is not limited to domestic violence issues. Like we said, Congress has historically used its commerce power to pass progressive legislation, from the labor rights laws of the New Deal to the Civil Rights Act, and then in the '90s, to guns and domestic violence regulations. What the conservatives are doing in this case is arming themselves. They're giving themselves a weapon to wield against progressive legislation in the future. And we've already seen it used, our sixth episode was about NFIB v. Sebelius, a case about Obamacare, and there we explained how the Court claimed that the federal government did not have the power to regulate aspects of the insurance market.</p>
                        <p>0:42:18.3 Peter: The stakes here are huge. If and when Congress ever steps up and passes Green New Deal legislation, for example, there's almost no question that aspects of it will be challenged under the Commerce Clause. The conservatives have taken their control of the Court over the last several decades and turned it into a bulwark against progressive legislation, really usurping Congress's ability to pass laws and placing it in the hands of five and now six conservative Justices.</p>
                        <p>0:42:47.0 Michael: Right. When we were preparing for this episode, we talked about this case as sort of like one of the first instances of the conservative Court really starting to flex its muscle. And I think that's a good way to understand it, is them sort of being like, "You know what? We can fuck with them. We have some power now and we can use it."</p>
                        <p>0:43:07.8 Peter: Yeah. Now, before you wrap up, I want to mention one thing. I mentioned earlier that there's a second justification that Congress had for the Violence Against Women Act, and that's the Equal Protection Clause. Congress says, hey, the Fourteenth Amendment has a clause that says that everyone must be treated equally under the law, and so we're passing this law to further the equal treatment of women. And the Court rejects this, and what it says is that the Equal Protection Clause prevents states from treating citizens unequally, but that's it. It does not allow the federal government to pass laws to further the cause of equality.</p>
                        <p>0:43:40.5 Peter: This is itself a very academic discussion that we don't need to get into and we don't have the time to get into, but I just want to point out that it's another area where conservatives have tried to arbitrarily limit progressive legislation, this time by limiting the scope of the Equal Protection Clause and what its implications are. The view being espoused by the conservatives here is very commonly accepted among lawyers, but it's actually very shaky and ahistorical. And again, I don't want to get into too many details, but Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at Penn Law who clerked for Souter, who wrote the dissent in this case, in US v. Morrison, when this case came down, published a compelling article titled Bait and Switch: Why United States v. Morrison is Wrong about Section 5.</p>
                        <p>0:44:23.3 Peter: The article is worth the read, especially if you're a law student or a lawyer, only if you're a law student or a lawyer, I'll say, I can't subject everyone else to this, because it's a good example of how conservatives have kneecapped the possibility presented by the Equal Protection Clause, which we've harped on on this podcast. The Equal Protection Clause is a part of the Constitution that says that the law must treat everyone equally and if you are on the left, you have to look at that and think that if we want a constitutional basis for a better world, a better country, there it is staring us right in the face, everything that we believe in is laid out right there, and conservatives saw that before anyone.</p>
                        <p>0:45:04.8 Peter: And for 150 years, they've been working to arbitrarily narrow it to the best of their ability, and if we want, as leftists, as people on the left, who want to use the law as a weapon for equality and for justice, if you want to have a legal argument that you can lay out in defense of what we believe, it has to center around the Equal Protection Clause. And that's why, although I think it's probably too technical and academic of a discussion to get into here, but I couldn't ignore it entirely in this episode, 'cause I think it's important to point out the various ways in which the conservatives have hampered the cause. Worth noting that this is a project that spans the entire Constitution, and every clause that might give Congress power to pass progressive legislation, conservatives will push back against and argue that it's limited for whatever arbitrary reasons they can come up with.</p>
                        <p>0:46:01.1 Michael: And so I want to hit a point that Souter makes in his dissent. We've talked a lot about the record that Congress amassed here, and the point he makes is that it's actually bigger and more comprehensive than the historical record supporting the Civil Rights Act, which just goes to show how thorough this was. I mentioned earlier that there were 20 states doing gender task force reports as a part of this. It was just such a massive, massive project, and this law was the output of that project, and the Court is looking at that and saying, "No, no, just, no."</p>
                        <p>0:46:47.9 Michael: And I think it's just worth emphasizing that that's really what this is, this isn't objective, and this isn't the Court being constrained by the view of the Founders or the text of the Constitution. This is their biases and their own attitudes about women dictating the outcome of this case.</p>
                        <p>0:47:08.7 Peter: This is one of those cases where... What explains it better? What explains the conservative view of the Violence Against Women Act better? What explains the conservative view of the Commerce Clause better? Is it truly that they have some extremely specific view about the intersection of commerce and violence against women, or is it perhaps that they see a bigger picture here? That they can see the ways in which the federal government is able to step in and create progressive legislation and view that as a threat to the conservative political project, and recognize that they have the power to put a stop to it.</p>
                        <p>0:47:51.0 Peter: The simplest explanation is the correct one here, and it's really frankly the only thing that explains their extremely awkward and completely arbitrary creation of new rules every time a new law pops up that they don't like.</p>
                        <p>0:48:08.4 Rhiannon: Yes, yes. We've said this once, and we will say it over and over again, but if you think that conservative judges are writing their decisions based on a specific limited legal principle, you're wrong, and let this case be an example of policy preferences and views about what problems are important in society and what harm against what kind of groups of people is important to address, that's what they're actually making this decision on.</p>
                        <p>0:48:42.4 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:48:42.9 Peter: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:48:47.0 Peter: Next week is Atkins v. Virginia, a case about the execution of the mentally disabled. I'm not even sure if I'm ready for this one, guys.</p>
                        <p>0:49:00.9 Michael: No jokes, there's no...</p>
                        <p>0:49:01.0 Peter: There's no jokes here.</p>
                        <p>0:49:02.2 Michael: The sound of a balloon deflating.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:49:04.6 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:49:05.9 Peter: Oh, that's good. Taking the air out of our liberties like a balloon deflating. Alright, coming at you next week with a new metaphor, baby.</p>
                        <p>0:49:10.4 Michael: Right, exactly...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:49:15.2 Peter: This is the earliest I've ever had one ready. Follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod. Go to our website, buy our merch, tell your friends and family.</p>

                        <p>0:00:09.6 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about US v. Morrison, a case about the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. The case is also about the Interstate Commerce Clause and whether the billions of dollars the US economy loses because of gender-based violence should count as commerce. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court said no, making it impossible for victims of gender-based violence to sue for damages in federal court.</p>
                        <p>0:00:40.4 S?: Congress enacted the Civil Rights remedy of the Violence Against Women Act to remove one of the most persistent barriers to women's full equality and free participation in the economy, discriminatory gender-based violence.</p>
                        <p>0:00:54.2 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>

                        <p>0:01:20.6 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:20.5 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:20.6 Rhiannon: Hi, hello.</p>
                        <p>0:01:22.0 Peter: I thought that intro was strangely beautiful.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:01:26.7 Rhiannon: Interesting that you say it about your own writing, but... Yeah, sure.</p>
                        <p>0:01:29.8 Michael: Very strong imagery.</p>
                        <p>0:01:31.6 Peter: That's right. Today's case is US v. Morrison. This is the case about the Commerce Clause, but also violence against women. This is a case about the intersection of commerce and violence against women, and we will clarify momentarily. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act, a bill co-sponsored by Joe Biden that provided funding for the investigation and prosecution of domestic violence and allowed victims of domestic violence to sue for money damages in federal court. There is one thing you have to understand about the Constitution for this case. The federal government can only do things the Constitution specifically says it can do, so every time Congress passes a law, it has to explain in the law, where in the Constitution it says that they have the power to pass that law.</p>
                        <p>0:02:28.5 Peter: One thing that the Constitution says Congress can do is "Regulate commerce among the several states." This is known as the Interstate Commerce Clause, or just the Commerce Clause. The idea is very simple, if something concerns the economy of one state, that's the state's business and the federal government can't pass laws about it, but if something concerns the economies of multiple states, then that is a federal issue, makes sense? Should be simple enough.</p>
                        <p>0:02:53.9 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>0:02:54.9 Peter: The idea is that as soon as economic activity crosses state lines, it's now a federal concern that can be regulated by the federal government, but the contours of this have been a legal battleground for many years, because especially as economies have grown more complex and expanded, it's become less and less clear when economic activity can be said to occur solely within a state as opposed to among multiple states. And conservatives who do not want to see a powerful federal government have long been arguing that we should read this very narrowly so that Congress cannot pass too many sweeping laws.</p>
                        <p>0:03:32.5 Peter: This case is one of the many times the conservatives on the Court have made up a new and arbitrary rule to try to limit the ability of Congress to legislate, with the goal of hampering progressive legislation. So we're going to talk about the Violence Against Women Act, what Congress is trying to do and how the Court interferes, and we're also going to talk about this much bigger picture concept about the scope of the federal government's power under the Commerce Clause, which is a trip into one of the most heated, pedantic and pseudo-academic debates in the legal world.</p>
                        <p>0:04:07.6 Michael: I'm excited, guys, this is like my wheel house.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:04:12.8 Rhiannon: Michael's got something to say.</p>
                        <p>0:04:14.6 Peter: So one note we should make here up top is that the connection between violence against women and the Commerce Clause, it's obviously not really intuitive if you're not a lawyer, but bear with us. We will get you there. The gist of it is that gendered violence drives down women's participation in the economy and costs the economy billions of dollars a year. Women turn down jobs because of the threat of violence, they miss out as consumers because of partners who control their finances, on and on and on, and the scope of the impact of all this gendered violence crosses state lines. All of this was documented by Congress and used as their justification for passing the law. We will give this a little more color as we go on.</p>
                        <p>0:05:02.6 Rhiannon: Right. So VAWA, like Peter said, was passed in 1994.</p>
                        <p>0:05:07.1 Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Can't just bust out an acronym like that...</p>
                        <p>0:05:10.3 Rhiannon: I thought you said it.</p>
                        <p>0:05:11.3 Peter: I didn't say VAWA, I'm not in the know like that.</p>
                        <p>0:05:15.8 Rhiannon: Okay, so VAWA, which is the Violence Against Women Act, like Peter said, was passed in 1994, and it was actually passed after more than four years of congressional deliberation with numerous hearings and fact-finding proceedings leading up to passing the law. And this was congressional deliberation that explored the national problem of violence against women. In passing VAWA, Congress called domestic violence "a national tragedy played out every day in the lives of millions of American women at home, in the workplace and on the street." And so the law contained multiple provisions that were aimed at addressing violence against women in the United States.</p>
                        <p>0:05:58.2 Rhiannon: For example, between 1994 and the year 2000, the law provided $1.6 billion to fund a range of programs, including improving victim services, creating a National Domestic Violence hotline, and new initiatives to improve law enforcement's response to crimes like domestic violence and sexual assault. It created new federal felonies to address acts of interstate violence, and it had provisions to support immigrant women who were victims of domestic violence, it helped them in obtaining legal status, and then there were also research provisions to advance our national understanding of domestic violence and gender-based violence in the US.</p>
                        <p>0:06:42.8 Michael: Sounds like a pretty good law.</p>
                        <p>0:06:44.9 Rhiannon: Yeah, it was complicated, for sure. Complicated and comprehensive.</p>
                        <p>0:06:49.2 Peter: Yeah, Joe Biden, of course, co-sponsored the bill, and he famously said, "Come on, man. We need a law," you know.</p>
                        <p>0:06:57.6 Michael: No more of this domestic violence malarkey.</p>
                        <p>0:07:02.1 Rhiannon: Boys, they're doing malarkey.</p>
                        <p>0:07:03.8 Peter: Women across the country, I mean, come on.</p>
                        <p>0:07:07.7 Rhiannon: Again, thank you so much, Joe Biden. So the provision of VAWA that's at issue in this case provided for a civil cause of action for victims of gender-based violence in federal court. What that means in plain English is if you were a victim of gender-based violence, you could sue the perpetrator of that violence for damages, and that was even if no criminal charges had been filed against that person. And just want to note here that Congress carefully drafted and articulated all of these provisions in much the same way that Congress drafts lots of Civil Rights legislation, with an eye towards targeting only specific behavior that is clearly discriminatory, and it did so after hearing tons of testimony about the way violence against women interfere with women's full participation in the economy and public life, and it did so after hearing about the discriminatory manner in which states have treated gender-based claims historically.</p>
                        <p>0:08:10.2 Rhiannon: So Congress concluded after all of this testimony, after all of the fact-finding, that states weren't doing a good enough job at addressing gender-based violence, and so it created this cause of action. So we have that sort of statutory background that's the status of the law at this time, so turning to the facts of this specific case. What happened was just months after VAWA was passed and enacted in the fall of 1994, a freshman at Virginia Tech named Christy Brzonkala reported that she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by two fellow students, Antonio Morrison and James Crawford.</p>
                        <p>0:08:48.5 Rhiannon: Morrison and Crawford were members of Virginia Tech football team, and according to Christy Brzonkala's reports, they gang-raped her in her dorm room some 30 minutes after the three of them met for the very first time.</p>
                        <p>0:09:01.5 Michael: Jesus.</p>
                        <p>0:09:02.9 Rhiannon: And so she reported this sexual assault to the school, and Virginia Tech conducted disciplinary hearings. As a result of those school-led hearings, Morrison was suspended and Crawford ended up not being disciplined. Actually, in fact, eventually after an appeal, Morrison's suspension was overturned. Local law enforcement didn't really do anything with Brzonkala's report either, a grand jury did not indict them for criminal charges, so no criminal charges were filed against either Morrison or Crawford, and meanwhile, Brzonkala became increasingly depressed and in fact she attempted to commit suicide. Eventually she withdrew from Virginia Tech, and with no help or support from local law enforcement or the school, Brzonkala eventually filed suit in federal court.</p>
                        <p>0:09:57.3 Rhiannon: Now, she brings two cases: She sued Virginia Tech, the school, under Title 9, and we won't discuss that here, that's a different case, it's a different law, but she also sued Morrison and Crawford individually under this new provision of VAWA that had just been enacted. So when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Brzonkala's case, they said that her lawsuit couldn't go forward because this part of VAWA was unconstitutional. And Brzonkala appealed to Supreme Court. You'll notice that the case is called the US v. Morrison, that's because the federal government actually intervened to defend VAWA, so they became a party to the case, and that's how you get US v. Morrison.</p>
                        <p>0:10:41.5 Peter: So Congress has passed the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, which allows women to sue in federal court, and they say that they had the power to do this, to pass this law, because the Constitution allows them to regulate interstate commerce, and as their law explains in detail, violence against women has a widespread impact that substantially affects interstate commerce. For example, you have the various ways in which domestic violence impacts women's ability to find employment or to engage in the workforce, and it impacts their productivity. These are all things that we'll talk about in a bit that Congress finds, but the Supreme Court says, no, you can't do that, because violence against women isn't itself really economic activity, it's not really commerce, and so that doesn't count as something you can regulate.</p>
                        <p>0:11:31.1 Peter: I want to also note, there's an Equal Protection argument, Congress says that they also have the power to pass this under the Equal Protection argument. We'll touch on this later. It's a complex and academic topic, but I don't want the nerds to think that I'm ignoring it, we're going to get to get to it, we'll get to it at the end, right. Relax.</p>
                        <p>0:11:47.3 Rhiannon: Do not yell at us.</p>
                        <p>0:11:49.1 Michael: Or we'll yell back.</p>
                        <p>0:11:50.4 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:11:51.6 Michael: You are like that.</p>
                        <p>0:11:52.0 Peter: So to make sure we're all on the same page here, the Constitution again has this clause called the Commerce Clause, and basically the rule, the legal rule is that the states can regulate economic activity that happens in their states, but if there's economic activity that happens across multiple states, then the federal government regulates that. But what exactly it means for commerce to be taking place solely in a state as opposed to in multiple states has become less clear as economies have become more complex. Back in the day, it might have been relatively simple. At the time of the Founding, there were two basic types of businesses, agriculture and prostitution, and this is not based on a lot of research, I'm just kind of eye-balling this.</p>
                        <p>0:12:37.9 Peter: So there would be a guy in your town with a beef steak tomato farm, and he would go to the town center to sell them, and you would buy 14 of them so that each member of your family, which had 14 people in it, could eat a single beef steak tomato for dinner and...</p>
                        <p>0:12:51.5 Michael: The farmer could sleep with a prostitute.</p>
                        <p>0:12:54.9 Peter: And the farmer would use that money to go to the brothel or the house of ill repute nearby, and he would have sex with a prostitute. All of that is happening entirely within your state, so the federal government can't regulate that, but if the tomato farmer crosses state lines to sell his tomatoes, then the federal government is allowed to regulate that. Same applies to your basic prosecuting operations.</p>
                        <p>0:13:21.0 Peter: So think about that tomato transaction now. You go to a grocery store to buy a tomato. That grocery store's headquarters is probably in another state, it probably has operations across multiple states, it probably uses technology that sends data across multiple states. The workers might cross state lines to get to work depending on where you are. The tomato itself has almost certainly crossed a state border. The development of the economy has meant that people and things and information are crossing state lines all the time, and what that means is that as the economy has developed, the federal government's power to regulate the economy has grown.</p>
                        <p>0:13:57.6 Michael: Right, right. And so in the '30s, the New Deal had resulted in all sorts of new federal laws, the Supreme Court started striking some of them down, claiming that the federal government was exceeding its power to regulate interstate commerce. In 1936, the Court struck down federal regulations on mining, saying that mining was not commerce, even though the commodity being mined was going to be sold across state lines. That seems maybe a little pedantic, but conservatives at the time were really concerned about the size of the federal government during the New Deal and how it was going to explode, and they were looking for anything they could find to rein that in.</p>
                        <p>0:14:41.9 Michael: And so that's, FDR as a result starts applying political pressure to the Court, he threatens to pack it with more Justices in order to preserve his legislation.</p>
                        <p>0:14:52.7 Peter: That's right. Get their asses, bro.</p>
                        <p>0:14:54.7 Michael: Yeah, that's right. Pack the courts.</p>
                        <p>0:14:57.1 Rhiannon: How's a little political power feel, huh?</p>
                        <p>0:15:00.5 Michael: Good positive history in our country. And Court bent to that pressure. In a case called NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel, the Court held that the federal government could regulate activities that had a substantial effect on interstate commerce, so not necessarily just like that transaction, but like anything that affects interstate commerce. And then for many decades after, basically up until this case, and maybe just a few years before, there were just no decisions limiting the federal government's power under the Commerce Clause, but during much of that time, the conservative legal movement was being built from the ground up, and they were mad as hell about the fact that the federal government could regulate anything that impacts commerce, even if it's sort of indirectly so.</p>
                        <p>0:15:52.5 Michael: They didn't like seeing the federal government handed the keys to all this power, and especially since this power that's historically been used to pass progressive legislation, right.</p>
                        <p>0:16:05.6 Peter: So the sort of next part of this story is that in 1990, the federal government passes a law about gun violence, and they argue that their power to pass that law comes from the fact that gun violence impacts commerce between the states and in 1995, for the first time in nearly 60 years, the Supreme Court strikes down a federal law under the Commerce Clause. And that gets the ball rolling here, right, the first blow struck by the nascent conservative legal movement against the power of the federal government under the Commerce Clause. And that brings us here to this case.</p>
                        <p>0:16:39.1 Rhiannon: Guys, I just feel like I'm really being brought back to 1L con law, this is a blast from the past, all these cases that we're talking about. Did you guys spend half of con law talking about the Commerce Clause?</p>
                        <p>0:16:54.9 Michael: Yeah, my con law was mainly Commerce Clause and Equal Protection, Fourth Amendment fundamental rights stuff.</p>
                        <p>0:17:01.8 Peter: I zoned out for most of con law. I'm good at studying. The last two weeks were all I needed, I would really pack it in, so I don't really remember what the discussions were throughout the year, unfortunately.</p>
                        <p>0:17:13.0 Rhiannon: That's great. Peter went to an Ivy law school... Went to an Ivy law school and does not remember discussions had, which I think is beautiful, and that's why he's the Law Boy.</p>
                        <p>0:17:26.2 Peter: I remember the vibes, though, I remember the vibes.</p>
                        <p>0:17:30.6 Michael: There was a Yale law grad on Twitter who was marveling at the fact that the bottle of shampoo he purchased in use for months was dog shampoo, and the only indication of that was the fact that there was a large photo of a dog on the bottle.</p>
                        <p>0:17:49.8 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's why Ivy grads are stupid. I like that, alright.</p>
                        <p>0:17:54.0 Michael: Yeah, let's not give Ivy law grads too much credit here.</p>
                        <p>0:17:58.2 Peter: Yeah, but he probably graduated towards the top of his class. That's the thing is, if you're at a top school and you go to the top of the class, those kids are freaks, alright, those kids are weird as hell. You gotta go down towards the middle, alright, for the cool kids. That's where I was, just hovering with the masses, man of the people.</p>
                        <p>0:18:19.2 Rhiannon: Keep telling yourself that, buddy. Yup.</p>
                        <p>0:18:21.3 Peter: Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry, Rhi, I forgot that you went to an everyman law school, that everyone can get into.</p>
                        <p>0:18:28.5 Rhiannon: Shut up. Shut up.</p>
                        <p>0:18:31.7 Michael: A friend told me a story once about how there was a kid in her law school class who would bring a Snickers bar into every exam and he would cut it into thirds, I think it was, or quarters, and then every 30 minutes or whatever, he would eat one piece of it.</p>
                        <p>0:18:48.7 Peter: Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>0:18:51.8 Michael: Yeah, the punchline of the story was that he ended up with Supreme Court clerkship, so...</p>
                        <p>0:18:52.7 Peter: Yeah. Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>0:18:57.4 Michael: That's the elite, the legal elite.</p>
                        <p>0:19:00.0 Peter: By comparison, my last 1L final, I brought whiskey and I poured it like three quarters of the way through the exam, and I was like, I'll be fine.</p>
                        <p>0:19:11.9 Peter: Alright, we are now in the year 2000, this case. Congress has passed this law designed to combat violence against women, which gives them the right to sue in federal court. Like I mentioned, when Congress passes a law, it needs to point out what part of the Constitution gives it the authority to pass that law, and they claimed that their constitutional authority derives from the Commerce Clause and their power to regulate interstate commerce. What they say is that violence against women has a significant impact on commerce, and they submit a massive amount of evidence to support that.</p>
                        <p>0:19:44.1 Michael: Right. So just to cut in, Rhiannon said that Congress spent four years developing this and holding hearings, and just to go over some of their findings, sort of substantiating this link between gendered violence and interstate commerce, they found that it's like billions of dollars a year in lost productivity and wages, for a variety of reasons. 50% of rape victims end up losing their jobs, the ones who keep their jobs have decreased productivity, victims of domestic violence likewise have lots of absenteeism and sick time because either they can't leave their homes or they don't want to go into work because the bruises and the cuts from the domestic violence are visible and they want to hide it.</p>
                        <p>0:20:37.2 Michael: On top of that, even women who were not themselves victims of gendered violence nonetheless have it shape their participation in the economy because they'll turn down better paying night jobs or jobs in the areas of heightened risk, which Congress found were justified fears, that later hours or working downtown or whatever, you're more likely to be the victim of gendered violence. So it's just massive, the impact gendered violence has on the economy was just demonstrably massive.</p>
                        <p>0:21:11.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's hard to even come up with words for how sort of everyday and pernicious gender-based violence is, and I think it's important to highlight that whether or not you think VAWA and all of its provisions were very good at addressing gender-based violence, I have my own views about, say, sending a bunch of funding to local law enforcement and saying that police should handle domestic violence cases in specific ways, but it was Congress looking at this issue for a long time and realizing how bad, how massive the impact is on the nation's economy and trying to address that with a sort of comprehensive legislative scheme that would allow women in different ways to combat the reality of living in a rape culture and a culture sort of built on the oppression of non-men.</p>
                        <p>0:22:09.0 Peter: I think, to agree, this is sort of common sense. Of course, being the victim of discrete acts of violence or continued acts of violence is going to impact the degree to which you are engaging with the workforce or the broader economy, right, that does feel to me like common sense, and it's backed up by hard data. So basically, Congress saying that even though they are not regulating commerce directly through VAWA, they're regulating it indirectly. And the Supreme Court rejects this in a 5-4 opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist.</p>
                        <p>0:22:43.0 Peter: The legal rule created by earlier Supreme Court decisions is that if something "substantially affects" interstate commerce, then Congress can regulate, even if it's not commerce itself. And the Court can't say that violence against women doesn't substantially affect interstate commerce, because Congress has a huge amount of evidence that it does. So what they say is, look, violence against women is not economic activity, and so it's not covered by the Commerce Clause. Specifically, Rehnquist says, "Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not in any sense of the phrase economic activity."</p>
                        <p>0:23:27.6 Michael: It's a shame that Congress tried to pass this law under the Economic Activity Clause.</p>
                        <p>0:23:35.9 Peter: The first thing to note here is that that's not the rule. The rule is supposed to be that Congress can regulate things that substantially affect interstate commerce. The Rehnquist Court has made up the economic activity versus non-economic activity distinction. But more importantly, and more essential to the issue here, the idea that gender-motivated crimes are not "in any sense of the phrase economic activity" is something that just about any fucking honest economist will tell you is incorrect. Everything you do has an implied cost and a nominal impact on the economy. Whether or not someone is directly engaged in the exchange of money for goods and services, they are essentially always, or at least often engaged in the economy in some material way.</p>
                        <p>0:24:23.2 Peter: I'm not saying Congress should be able to regulate everything, the rule is that there must be a substantial impact on interstate commerce, but at the very least, there is no clear distinction between what you might call economic activity and non-economic activity. If someone obstructs a highway, which prevents people from getting to work or conducting business, can Congress step in and regulate that? Yes, because the highway is what the law calls a channel of interstate commerce, which everyone agrees they can regulate, and yet when domestic violence prevents people from working or conducting business, that is somehow according to the conservatives on the Court non-economic activity. Yeah, the distinction is meaningless, and the Court's made up rule is just pure sophistry, it is the output of a conservative legal movement that has been desperate to create some sort of rule that would limit the federal government's power, and after failing to come up with something good settled for this contrived bullshit that sounds like the most obviously incorrect multiple choice answer on a bar exam.</p>
                        <p>0:25:33.3 Michael: Right. And I think the facts of this case are a great example of how bullshit it is, because going to college is absolutely economic activity, it totally determines how and whether you can participate in the economy. And this woman dropped out of college as a result of this. Whether or not you're depressed impacts whether and how you can participate in the economy, and she became seriously depressed, right, suicidal. That is incapacitating. This is a person who has been effectively taken out of the workforce for some indeterminate amount of time, and when she re-enters is going to be in a substantially different economic position because of where her education stopped.</p>
                        <p>0:26:22.4 Michael: That is economic. There's just no way around it. And like this is such bullshit on their part too, 'cause it's like, it's just not their job. The Supreme Court does not do fact-finding, it's like the last thing they're supposed to do, and it's so dishonest, they quote themselves saying, look, simply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so. But that case, first of all that's bullshit, but that case they were talking about when Congress had no findings at all.</p>
                        <p>0:26:58.6 Peter: And I want to give a little bit of color here, because in the prior case that, the Lopez case from 1995 about gun violence, Congress hadn't submitted any evidence that linked commerce to gun regulation. They just said, well, it impacts it, right, and that's why in this case, they submitted a huge amount. And Rehnquist is like, no, I don't think so, though.</p>
                        <p>0:27:18.9 Michael: Yeah, that quote makes sense in the context of that case because that was a law where Congress hadn't submitted extensive findings, and so it's like, yeah, if Congress just says this impacts commerce and doesn't back it up at all, sure, the Court might disagree, but that's not the case here. The case here is that Congress had substantial, like overwhelming evidence that this greatly impact interstate commerce, and the Court was just like, nah. And this is like... We've seen this in other cases we've discussed, in Shelby County v. Holder with the Voting Rights Act, where Congress submitted months of finding from hearings and studies and all this, thousands of pages about why their formula was correct, and the Supreme Court was like, no, I just disagree.</p>
                        <p>0:28:08.2 Michael: And it's just the height of judicial activism, it's the height of judicial law-making, of usurping Congress's role in legislating. And we talk about the importance of recognizing that courts do that, but it's just so important to call out when the conservatives who supposedly hate that stuff are engaging in it so egregiously, which they are here.</p>
                        <p>0:28:34.6 Rhiannon: Right, exactly, and I think this case also shows how the Rehnquist Court viewed violence against women like this exclusively domestic, private issue rather than a society-wide problem that warrants public government involvement, which is what Congress showed. Like Michael, you talked about the facts of Christy Brzonkala's case showing that absolutely she was participating in economic activity, and how gender-based violence took her out of that economic activity.</p>
                        <p>0:29:07.8 Rhiannon: What Congress did in passing the law and holding all of these hearings was showing how widespread exactly Christy Brzonkala's case was, that it was happening across the country and having a significant impact on the economy. And so the perspective from the Rehnquist Court that violence against women is just like this private matter that happens at home, that's significant because it influences how federal and state powers work together on an issue. Like if something is a purely domestic issue, if it's purely a private problem or at most a problem that is already addressed by state criminal law or local law enforcement, then that's not an issue that the federal government has the power to regulate or influence, that's outside the scope of the federal government's power and Congress's law-making ability, sure.</p>
                        <p>0:30:00.5 Rhiannon: But it's important to highlight, but this is a misogynistic viewpoint to deny how widespread and toxic and deeply pernicious violence against women is, and that's what's predicating this argument about federal versus state power. In minimizing how damaging and dangerous the reality of domestic violence is, the Supreme Court sort of gets to shoe horn in this conservative viewpoint on federalism.</p>
                        <p>0:30:26.1 Michael: Yeah, no, I think that's exactly right, Rhi. And I think it's very endemic to the conservative world view, where they sort of reject systemic explanations and systemic approaches to things and try to make everything this atomized, individual inquiry, like racism is a question of what's in your heart. And it's something you see consistently across sort of domains in conservative legal thinking, and so you see it here where like domestic violence, the idea that that's some big nationwide issue, like a larger cultural institutional issue that requires big legislation to ameliorate and to fix is just something that they flatly reject.</p>
                        <p>0:31:18.4 Peter: It's a core tenet of conservative politics that you reject the structural problem and re-frame it as an individualized problem. It's like unemployment, right, when unemployment spikes, is that a structural problem that needs to be addressed with broad sweeping legislation? No, no, no. It's lazy people.</p>
                        <p>0:31:38.7 Michael: Right. And the environment is like, turn off your lights and recycle, not like we need to regulate companies and make sure that they're using...</p>
                        <p>0:31:49.5 Peter: Exactly. And racism, is it something that needs to be addressed with something big, like maybe reparations or something that looks like that? No, no, it's just get your vibes right, bro. Just sort of reframe your vibes and you'll be good. So again, we have the conservative Court here saying that Congress can't regulate domestic violence in this way by making up this sort of fictional distinction between economic and non-economic activity, and they're saying, well, domestic violence, that's non-economic activity.</p>
                        <p>0:32:21.0 Peter: And the fact that the conservatives essentially made up a new and arbitrary rule to limit the power of the federal government to pass laws, very telling. The Constitution says that the feds can regulate commerce between the states; like I mentioned back in the day, that might have meant only a few things, but in the modern economy, it means a huge amount, people, goods, data, all crossing state lines constantly. And that means that the federal government's power has grown, and conservatives don't like this, because historically, the feds have used that power to pass progressive legislation.</p>
                        <p>0:32:56.0 Peter: But that's not an actual constitutional reason to strike laws down. They're just frustrated with the reality here, the reality of the implications of the Commerce Clause. And so they're engaging in what they claim to hate, traditional policy-making. And this opinion is rife with it. Rehnquist is basically saying, well, look, if the federal government can regulate everything that substantially impacts commerce, they're going to have too much power. And it's like, well, that's not really your job to decide, that's not the Court's role.</p>
                        <p>0:33:27.9 Peter: How many times have we heard the conservatives basically say, well, whether or not this is good policy is irrelevant. Our job is just to correctly interpret the Constitution. And yet here they are, oddly rejecting that train of thought when the outcome is something that benefits the left. They're actively doing living constitutionalism, the very thing that originalists claim to hate. Living constitutionalism is the idea that our understanding of what the Constitution means should evolve over time. That's what they're doing here. The bottom line is they're saying, look, the social context has changed enough that we shouldn't read the Constitution so literally, which I don't find to be in and of itself particularly offensive, but I'd like to see them admit what they're doing.</p>
                        <p>0:34:11.6 Rhiannon: Right, just be real about it.</p>
                        <p>0:34:13.2 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:34:14.5 Peter: I also want to point out some of the historical context for their opposition to federal power under the Commerce Clause. 'Cause I think you can think about like, well, interstate commerce, it all seems maybe a little bit abstruse, maybe a little bit like I don't know how much this matters. In 1964, there was a case called Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States. That was a case where hotel owners in the South who wanted to discriminate against black people in their business sued the federal government saying that they did not have the power under the Constitution, under the Commerce Clause to pass the Civil Rights Act. Part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a law saying that places of public accommodation such as hotels could not discriminate on the basis of race. And Congress said their power to do that was found in the Commerce Clause. Hotels, they accept people that have been traveling between states and therefore they could be regulated under the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce.</p>
                        <p>0:35:09.0 Peter: And the Supreme Court agreed, upholding that pivotal civil rights legislation. And conservatives quietly bristled, maybe not so quietly at the time, but they're a little quieter about it these days. They didn't want the federal government using its commerce power to pass what they view as sort of socially progressive legislation. And the same thing is happening here, the conservatives are upset that the government is passing socially liberal legislation, and they're trying to throw as many wrenches at it as possible.</p>
                        <p>0:35:40.5 Rhiannon: Yes. And I think it's important to talk about the impact of US v. Morrison on women and what remedies were left for victims of gender-based violence if this provision of the law was deemed unconstitutional. I think a lot of people have rightly pointed out that the case has a much bigger impact really on Congress's ability to pass laws under the Commerce Clause, rather than just taking away all of the remedies available to these victims. And that's because states have their own statutory schemes addressing gender-based violence. Depending on what state you're in, you can sue in state court. And certainly, there are state criminal laws that have been beefed up to address domestic violence more seriously.</p>
                        <p>0:36:24.5 Rhiannon: But I do think there's discussion to be had about what it means to women to treat gender-based violence as a violation of your civil rights. And that's what this provision of VAWA was passed as. This is very similar and mirrors Civil Rights legislation, like Peter was just talking about. One of the ways that we show as a society that we are taking a problem seriously is by enacting legal accountability. It's symbolically and culturally important to have laws that address problems because it shows that sort of government and stakeholders and everybody are taking the problems that citizens face seriously. It's saying gender-based violence is incredibly degrading and dangerous, and because that is so, you have this legal accountability mechanism. You can go to federal court and get damages for the harm that you have experienced. And I think that impact is significant, that we don't have that because it shows the Court is not taking this problem seriously.</p>
                        <p>0:37:34.5 Rhiannon: The legislative history for VAWA as a Civil Rights remedy shows that Congress was responding to the effect of discriminatory, gender-based violence on women's full participation in commerce. For example, documented in this legislative history was that gender-based violence deters women's movement. It keeps them from walking at night, even in their own neighborhoods. It restricts their use of public transportation, which limits where and when they'll travel. There was documentation that gender-based violence reduces consumer spending, showing that women, for example, don't go to movies alone after dark.</p>
                        <p>0:38:15.2 Rhiannon: And just like the impact of race discrimination on racial minorities in their choice of jobs, Congress also documented in passing VAWA that gender-based violence deters women from taking jobs in certain areas or at certain hours, like Michael said earlier. And so overall, this is like this broad conclusion that gender-based crimes and fear of those crimes restricts movement, reduces employment opportunities and reduces consumer spending. And so, as a woman, you think, okay, what is my remedy for that happening to me? If my movement has been restricted, if my employment opportunities have been restricted, if my consumer spending and participation in the economy like I please, if that has been limited because of gender-based violence, because of this discriminatory violence against me, where is my remedy? What law allows me to sue for that, right?</p>
                        <p>0:39:09.5 Rhiannon: And so, I think it's important to just highlight that, yes, while there are other remedies available, like criminal law or state statutory schemes for being made whole after suffering gender-based violence, I think the impact in this provision of VAWA being found unconstitutional is really in what it demonstrates about our government and the society not taking this seriously.</p>
                        <p>0:39:35.8 Michael: Right. And it's worth mentioning that part of the motivation and part of the congressional findings behind this law was that those alternative remedies often are no remedy at all.</p>
                        <p>0:39:47.0 Rhiannon: Yes, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:39:48.6 Michael: That the same biases that create gendered violence in the first place are also endemic among police officers, among prosecutors, among judges and juries and court employees and everyone, and so those remedies don't become available. There was a Senate report in 1991 that said study after study commissioned by the highest courts of the states, over 20 states from Florida to New York, California to New Jersey, Nevada to Minnesota, has concluded that crimes disproportionately affecting women are treated less seriously than comparable crimes against men. And further, that collectively, these reports provide overwhelming evidence that gender bias permeates the courts system and that women are most often its victims. And so I think it's fair to say that this Supreme Court case, rather than engaging with those facts, is like an example of that bias.</p>
                        <p>0:40:51.5 Rhiannon: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>0:40:51.5 Michael: This is that same permeating discrimination that sort of downplays the harms and impacts of gendered violence.</p>
                        <p>0:41:00.7 Rhiannon: Right, right. And that's exactly what Congress was trying to point out. But yet again, in this case, you have the Court stepping in and sort of claiming expertise where they don't have any and denying this really extensive fact-finding.</p>
                        <p>0:41:13.1 Michael: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:41:15.5 Peter: Although to be fair, William Rehnquist might have a kind of expertise in domestic violence...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:41:24.1 Michael: Yes. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:41:24.2 Rhiannon: It doesn't matter 'cause that motherfucker is dead.</p>
                        <p>0:41:26.0 Peter: That's right. To the lawyers of his estate, I said "might."</p>
                        <p>[laughter.</p>
                        <p>0:41:33.8 Peter: There's also a much bigger picture issue here. The impact of this case is not limited to domestic violence issues. Like we said, Congress has historically used its commerce power to pass progressive legislation, from the labor rights laws of the New Deal to the Civil Rights Act, and then in the '90s, to guns and domestic violence regulations. What the conservatives are doing in this case is arming themselves. They're giving themselves a weapon to wield against progressive legislation in the future. And we've already seen it used, our sixth episode was about NFIB v. Sebelius, a case about Obamacare, and there we explained how the Court claimed that the federal government did not have the power to regulate aspects of the insurance market.</p>
                        <p>0:42:18.3 Peter: The stakes here are huge. If and when Congress ever steps up and passes Green New Deal legislation, for example, there's almost no question that aspects of it will be challenged under the Commerce Clause. The conservatives have taken their control of the Court over the last several decades and turned it into a bulwark against progressive legislation, really usurping Congress's ability to pass laws and placing it in the hands of five and now six conservative Justices.</p>
                        <p>0:42:47.0 Michael: Right. When we were preparing for this episode, we talked about this case as sort of like one of the first instances of the conservative Court really starting to flex its muscle. And I think that's a good way to understand it, is them sort of being like, "You know what? We can fuck with them. We have some power now and we can use it."</p>
                        <p>0:43:07.8 Peter: Yeah. Now, before you wrap up, I want to mention one thing. I mentioned earlier that there's a second justification that Congress had for the Violence Against Women Act, and that's the Equal Protection Clause. Congress says, hey, the Fourteenth Amendment has a clause that says that everyone must be treated equally under the law, and so we're passing this law to further the equal treatment of women. And the Court rejects this, and what it says is that the Equal Protection Clause prevents states from treating citizens unequally, but that's it. It does not allow the federal government to pass laws to further the cause of equality.</p>
                        <p>0:43:40.5 Peter: This is itself a very academic discussion that we don't need to get into and we don't have the time to get into, but I just want to point out that it's another area where conservatives have tried to arbitrarily limit progressive legislation, this time by limiting the scope of the Equal Protection Clause and what its implications are. The view being espoused by the conservatives here is very commonly accepted among lawyers, but it's actually very shaky and ahistorical. And again, I don't want to get into too many details, but Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at Penn Law who clerked for Souter, who wrote the dissent in this case, in US v. Morrison, when this case came down, published a compelling article titled Bait and Switch: Why United States v. Morrison is Wrong about Section 5.</p>
                        <p>0:44:23.3 Peter: The article is worth the read, especially if you're a law student or a lawyer, only if you're a law student or a lawyer, I'll say, I can't subject everyone else to this, because it's a good example of how conservatives have kneecapped the possibility presented by the Equal Protection Clause, which we've harped on on this podcast. The Equal Protection Clause is a part of the Constitution that says that the law must treat everyone equally and if you are on the left, you have to look at that and think that if we want a constitutional basis for a better world, a better country, there it is staring us right in the face, everything that we believe in is laid out right there, and conservatives saw that before anyone.</p>
                        <p>0:45:04.8 Peter: And for 150 years, they've been working to arbitrarily narrow it to the best of their ability, and if we want, as leftists, as people on the left, who want to use the law as a weapon for equality and for justice, if you want to have a legal argument that you can lay out in defense of what we believe, it has to center around the Equal Protection Clause. And that's why, although I think it's probably too technical and academic of a discussion to get into here, but I couldn't ignore it entirely in this episode, 'cause I think it's important to point out the various ways in which the conservatives have hampered the cause. Worth noting that this is a project that spans the entire Constitution, and every clause that might give Congress power to pass progressive legislation, conservatives will push back against and argue that it's limited for whatever arbitrary reasons they can come up with.</p>
                        <p>0:46:01.1 Michael: And so I want to hit a point that Souter makes in his dissent. We've talked a lot about the record that Congress amassed here, and the point he makes is that it's actually bigger and more comprehensive than the historical record supporting the Civil Rights Act, which just goes to show how thorough this was. I mentioned earlier that there were 20 states doing gender task force reports as a part of this. It was just such a massive, massive project, and this law was the output of that project, and the Court is looking at that and saying, "No, no, just, no."</p>
                        <p>0:46:47.9 Michael: And I think it's just worth emphasizing that that's really what this is, this isn't objective, and this isn't the Court being constrained by the view of the Founders or the text of the Constitution. This is their biases and their own attitudes about women dictating the outcome of this case.</p>
                        <p>0:47:08.7 Peter: This is one of those cases where... What explains it better? What explains the conservative view of the Violence Against Women Act better? What explains the conservative view of the Commerce Clause better? Is it truly that they have some extremely specific view about the intersection of commerce and violence against women, or is it perhaps that they see a bigger picture here? That they can see the ways in which the federal government is able to step in and create progressive legislation and view that as a threat to the conservative political project, and recognize that they have the power to put a stop to it.</p>
                        <p>0:47:51.0 Peter: The simplest explanation is the correct one here, and it's really frankly the only thing that explains their extremely awkward and completely arbitrary creation of new rules every time a new law pops up that they don't like.</p>
                        <p>0:48:08.4 Rhiannon: Yes, yes. We've said this once, and we will say it over and over again, but if you think that conservative judges are writing their decisions based on a specific limited legal principle, you're wrong, and let this case be an example of policy preferences and views about what problems are important in society and what harm against what kind of groups of people is important to address, that's what they're actually making this decision on.</p>
                        <p>0:48:42.4 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:48:42.9 Peter: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:48:47.0 Peter: Next week is Atkins v. Virginia, a case about the execution of the mentally disabled. I'm not even sure if I'm ready for this one, guys.</p>
                        <p>0:49:00.9 Michael: No jokes, there's no...</p>
                        <p>0:49:01.0 Peter: There's no jokes here.</p>
                        <p>0:49:02.2 Michael: The sound of a balloon deflating.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:49:04.6 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:49:05.9 Peter: Oh, that's good. Taking the air out of our liberties like a balloon deflating. Alright, coming at you next week with a new metaphor, baby.</p>
                        <p>0:49:10.4 Michael: Right, exactly...</p>

                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:00:08.2 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Navarette v. California, a 2014 case about policing. In it, the Supreme Court ruled that an officer can pull someone over based on an unverified anonymous tip. The ruling gave rise to police practices that are ripe for abuse and discrimination.</p>
                        <p>0:00:32.1 S?: Navarette's attorney Paul Kleven argued the initial police stop was improper, saying California Highway Patrol did not witness any signs of reckless or drunk and driving before pulling the man over.</p>
                        <p>0:00:43.8 S?: Police officer allowed to pull them over without the reasonable suspicion that they're supposed to have, so they're intruding on all those people's privacy.</p>
                        <p>0:00:50.2 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:00:58.9 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have driven our liberties to the outer edges of their habitats, like American settlers did to the gray wolf. I am Peter, I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:12.6 Rhiannon: Hey, pour one out for the gray wolf.</p>
                        <p>0:01:15.0 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:16.0 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:17.5 Peter: Yeah, unfortunately, as we go forward, the more likely I am to use an extinction metaphor every single week.</p>
                        <p>0:01:29.7 Rhiannon: Have you done buffalo?</p>
                        <p>0:01:31.2 Peter: I have not done buffalo, but it is on my quick list of potential metaphors.</p>
                        <p>0:01:37.7 Michael: Do not tell me that you're saving that for when we do native rights stuff.</p>
                        <p>0:01:44.3 Peter: No, in that case, I would use the natives themselves.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:01:54.0 Peter: Today's case is Navarette v. California. This is the latest entry into our canon of episodes about the various ways in which cops are allowed to bother you, thanks to the Supreme Court. This is a case about whether the cops can pull you over and stop you on the street because they received an anonymous tip that you are doing something wrong, even if the cops themselves did not see it. One interesting thing about this case is that it did not split across the usual ideological lines. Justice Scalia, who had a fairly strong libertarian streak on Fourth Amendment issues, joined the liberals in dissent, but Justice Stephen Breyer, the ostensible liberal Justice, joined the conservatives, as he often does in Fourth Amendment cases and criminal defendants' rights cases more broadly, which means that while this is one of a long line of our cop episodes, it is the first in our Stephen Breyer retire immediately line of episodes.</p>
                        <p>0:02:52.2 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:02:54.1 Peter: There has been an increasingly strong call for Breyer to retire, and we're throwing our hat in the ring here with a substantive critique, because not only is he a very old Justice who should step down and be replaced by someone who can hold the seat for longer, but he also low-key sucks on several key issues.</p>
                        <p>0:03:14.7 Michael: That's right. You won't find us stanning him like some other legal podcasts.</p>
                        <p>0:03:19.3 Peter: That's correct.</p>
                        <p>0:03:23.6 Michael: We genuinely don't stan anyone, and I think that's right, fan culture is toxic in legal media.</p>
                        <p>0:03:28.9 Peter: That's true, we come closest to stanning Sotomayor, but when the time comes, we will throw her to the wolves.</p>
                        <p>0:03:35.3 Michael: She is a former prosecutor.</p>
                        <p>0:03:39.3 Peter: That's right. Alright, Rhi, if you can walk us through some background here.</p>
                        <p>0:03:43.3 Rhiannon: Yeah, sure. So this happens back in 2008, this is a cop story, but I feel lucky to just not be telling all of you listeners a cop story where somebody ends up horribly maimed or dead, so maybe just a little bit better than the usual cop stories we're bringing you. So back in 2008, what happens is a dispatcher for California Highway Patrol in Mendocino County got a call from a counterpart dispatcher in another county. That counterpart told the dispatcher in Mendocino that they had just received a tip from a collar, and the substance of the tip was that a silver F150 pick-up truck had run the collar off the road, and the collar, a woman, gave the license plate number for the truck.</p>
                        <p>0:04:35.4 Rhiannon: So note right here, this is a woman who was allegedly run off the road calling into 911, and then that dispatch person calling California Highway Patrol dispatch in Mendocino County. So we're already on a bit of a game of telephone here. The Mendocino County dispatcher alerted their colleague and that person broadcast the message about this truck that had run somebody off the road. They broadcast that message to all of the California Highway Patrol officers in the area. That message went out at 3:47 PM. Now, by 4:00 PM, 13 minutes later, an officer from the California Highway Patrol had spotted a vehicle matching that description. By 4:05, just five minutes later, the officer pulled that vehicle over, even though the officer had observed no abnormal or illegal driving.</p>
                        <p>0:05:30.7 Rhiannon: Inside that truck were two people, Jose Prado Navarette and Lorenzo Prado Navarette. Now, cops get their documents, their license, their registration for the vehicle and they take it back to their cop car, but then as they return, they say that they suddenly smell marijuana. Based on the smell of marijuana, they search the truck and they find 30 pounds of the devil's lettuce. And so...</p>
                        <p>0:06:00.5 Michael: I gotta say, usually when cops say they detected an odor of marijuana, I'm like, do the jerk-off motion or whatever. But if there were fucking 30 pounds, I buy it. I totally buy that they detected an odor.</p>
                        <p>0:06:12.8 Peter: We will do a separate episode about why the cops are allowed to say that they smelled something and search your car.</p>
                        <p>0:06:20.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, totally. As a defense attorney, I'm skeptical about searches that result from an officer smelling something, but 30 pounds is a lot. So, okay. So, because of the marijuana that's found, both of the Navarette guys are arrested. In court, though, they challenged that stop, they challenged being pulled over by California Highway Patrol, and they argued that the cops didn't have reasonable suspicion of any illegal activity. Now, reasonable suspicion, of course is the standard that cops have to have to pull you over, they have to have reasonable suspicion that you have committed some criminal act.</p>
                        <p>0:07:03.9 Peter: Right, so to be clear here, their claim is not that they didn't have marijuana or anything like that, right, their claim is, you would have never found the marijuana if you had been abiding by the law, but instead you pulled us over without any constitutional reason.</p>
                        <p>0:07:20.4 Rhiannon: Exactly. And they argued that the officers hadn't observed any illegal or even erratic driving.</p>
                        <p>0:07:27.5 Peter: Better believe they were driving well, you're at 10 and 2, baby.</p>
                        <p>0:07:32.6 Rhiannon: Yes, at 10 at 2.</p>
                        <p>0:07:36.0 Michael: Signalling before you change lanes, for sure.</p>
                        <p>0:07:39.1 Rhiannon: Sure, right, exactly. One bead of sweat just slowly down the temple. So they argued that the officers hadn't observed any illegal driving and also that an anonymous tip about reckless driving without more doesn't get you to the level of reasonable suspicion that's required, because it's so vague, somebody called in and said, I was run off the road, here's the truck that did it.</p>
                        <p>0:08:04.9 Michael: Right, right. A long time ago now, at this point in our fifth episode, we covered a case called Terry v. Ohio, where we explained that police are allowed under the Constitution to stop you or your vehicle if they have "reasonable suspicion" that you were violating the law. That was a case about stop and frisk, which I think most people are familiar with, and this is a traffic stop, but the legal rule is actually the same, cops need to have reasonable suspicion that you were violating the law in order to stop you, whether you're on foot or in your car. And so both these situations come up under the Fourth Amendment, which protects you against unreasonable searches and seizures, and as I think most people know with stop and frisk, when cops had a lot of discretion, they abused it, and the same goes with automobile stops, as we'll discuss.</p>
                        <p>0:09:00.7 Michael: And so in the case here, the question is very simple: Can the cops stop you if the only evidence they have that you were violating the law is an anonymous tip?</p>
                        <p>0:09:12.3 Peter: Right, and the Court in a 5-4 opinion authored by Clarence Thomas says that, yes, they can. So like Michael said, the Fourth Amendment protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures, that includes protecting you from unreasonable traffic stops. Under the Constitution, if the cops find evidence during an illegal traffic stop, they can't hold that evidence against you in court. The plaintiffs here are saying that the marijuana found during the traffic stop can't be used as evidence against them because the cops did not have a legal reason to pull them over to begin with. This is important to the Navarettes because they don't want to get in trouble for the weed, but it's important to the rest of us, because it sets the boundaries for how flimsy the cops' excuse for stopping you or your vehicle can be.</p>
                        <p>0:09:58.8 Peter: As we'll dig into a bit later, if the cops can rely on a single unverified anonymous tip to pull someone over, that gives them a huge amount of discretion, and it will inevitably lead to innocent people being stopped in large numbers, either by accident or because the cops are abusing that discretion. If the Fourth Amendment is meant to protect against unreasonable searches and seizures, but the cops can seize you based on one vague anonymous tip that they have not corroborated, then what does that constitutional protection actually mean?</p>
                        <p>0:10:33.5 Peter: So let's talk about the Court's opinion here, written by Clarence Thomas. Thomas starts off by listing all the reasons that he believes this anonymous tip was enough to justify pulling these guys over. Let's go through them. First, he says that the specifics given by the anonymous caller, which were just the car type, the color and the license plate, lend credibility to the tip, which seems sort of weird to me to say that those details add credibility, because no one's saying the car doesn't exist. The question is what the car did, and whether the caller is either mistaken or lying, and the details about the car are entirely separate from the question of whether the person had violated the law, they're not related at all.</p>
                        <p>0:11:20.0 Peter: If someone says, hey, that car is red, and the guy inside it is actually a space alien in disguise, and you look at the car and it's red, you're not gonna be like, oh, shit, she was right about the car being red.</p>
                        <p>0:11:36.0 Michael: Are aliens here?</p>
                        <p>0:11:36.1 Peter: That really lends credibility to the alien thing.</p>
                        <p>0:11:39.8 Rhiannon: I want to believe.</p>
                        <p>0:11:42.1 Peter: And to put it a little more succinctly, this might be a little too much for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to process, but people are capable of saying a true thing and then a false thing. So second, he says, look, we have reason to believe that this person was telling the truth. If you look at the time when the call was made and compare it to where the truck was eventually spotted, it looks as though the call was made at about the time she would have been run off the road. Thomas is referring to an axiom of witness reliability that essentially says that people's statements are much more reliable as an event is occurring or right after an event occurred. This is something that's called an excited utterance, and it's the idea that something someone says as an event is happening or right after is generally reliable. Because the person is sort of reacting in real time. So if someone shouts, "He's got a gun," that's generally going to be an honest reflection of what that person was witnessing.</p>
                        <p>0:12:44.7 Peter: Justice Scalia, who writes the dissent here, points out this doesn't really apply to a situation where someone has pulled over to the side of the road, right, they had a moment to gather themselves and process. It's not really the same thing. But regardless, Thomas is just like bullshitting about psychological phenomena that he doesn't even remotely understand. There is an enormous body of research on this stuff, and he's not even pretending to engage with it in the context of this situation, he's just sort of like spouting off. And another important thing about this is, this is information that we know now, the time that she made the call, it's not something that the police knew at the time.</p>
                        <p>0:13:24.6 Peter: And the question here is whether the police had enough information at the time to pull the car over. They didn't know whether the tip came in right after or not, and so because of that, it shouldn't be relevant here. And I mention this because not only is it part of Thomas's analysis here, but you often see the court in cases like this sort of blur the line a little bit between what the court knows and what the officers knew at the time. But in reality, if the officers didn't know something, then it can't be factored into our evaluation of their mind state. And then Thomas says, look, this person called 911, so even though it's anonymous, they could theoretically be traced if it was a false report, which makes it more likely that the person calling was telling the truth.</p>
                        <p>0:14:11.3 Peter: Which it is true, that they could be traced, I guess, in a vacuum, maybe. I'm not sure it's worth much, especially since a false report of reckless driving is something you would never, ever get caught for. How would they even catch you? And also, we have zero reason to believe that this woman who called in knew that you could trace 911 calls. So why are we having this conversation at all?</p>
                        <p>0:14:37.9 Michael: Right, this was over a decade ago, but wasn't there just in the news now, New York wanting to talk about passing new laws about false reports because they are having issues with people trying to use the cops as like...</p>
                        <p>0:14:49.6 Peter: Yeah, it happens.</p>
                        <p>0:14:50.1 Rhiannon: Right. False reports are made all the time.</p>
                        <p>0:14:52.9 Michael: Right, and it's an issue.</p>
                        <p>0:14:55.2 Rhiannon: People call 911 and fucking lie to the dispatcher all the fucking time.</p>
                        <p>0:15:00.4 Peter: False reports are up 85% during the pandemic. I just made that up, but that sounds right, right?</p>
                        <p>0:15:07.8 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I want to take a minute to differentiate and maybe just sort of explicitly draw the difference between an anonymous tip and sort of a regular call to 911. So if you call 911 and you're reporting a crime that you have witnessed, what usually happens is that the caller will state their name, state where they were when something happened, often an address is given, they might talk about other witnesses who were there, they will tell the 911 dispatcher about any injury they suffered, and they will describe that, the 911 caller asks questions to get more information, so that the dispatcher can give the police that information, and the police have a sort of important substantive chunk of information that they then when they're going out to answer this call, they are then collecting even more evidence to corroborate that initial report to 911.</p>
                        <p>0:16:06.5 Michael: Yeah, you give them your location so the cops can show up and based on your credibility, they can either pretend like they're gonna do something and then just blow it off or just tell you to your face that they're not going to do anything.</p>
                        <p>0:16:17.5 Rhiannon: That's how policing works.</p>
                        <p>0:16:19.1 Peter: The are the options if you're white, it gets worse if you're not.</p>
                        <p>0:16:22.8 Michael: It definitely goes downhill from there.</p>
                        <p>0:16:26.6 Rhiannon: But here, with an anonymous tip, we have no information on which to base a judgment about the credibility and the context of the report, because all we have... We don't have a person's name, we don't have any significant details about their injury, the circumstances in which this allegation of reckless driving happened, and so there's nothing to go off of except find this car.</p>
                        <p>0:16:52.3 Peter: Right. The big picture concern here is like, if we want to live in a society where the Fourth Amendment means something, then the police should have to have some evidence that you violated the law before they pull you over. Being pulled over is common, but that doesn't mean it's like a minor thing, that is the force of the state bearing down on you. If you think being pulled over isn't a big deal, try running next time and see based on the cop's reaction whether he thinks it's a big deal. If you want to meaningfully limit the power of the government to fuck with you, then the police should have to have ample evidence that you did something wrong to pull you over, and if all they have is a vague anonymous tip, then they should have to corroborate that tip themselves, say, by following the car.</p>
                        <p>0:17:46.2 Peter: And I think that leads us to the last part of Thomas's argument, because this isn't just that they get a tip and they pull someone over, they get a tip that implies reckless driving, and they follow the guy for five minutes and they don't see any reckless driving. So one thing to note is that throughout this opinion, Thomas has been very heavily implying that the reason that these people were pulled over is because they were driving as if they were inebriated, that that's essentially what the report was and what the cops were concerned that they were inebriated, and that's why they pulled them over.</p>
                        <p>0:18:20.0 Michael: Not that just they were dicks to this one lady, but that they are going to cause a future accident and they're going to...</p>
                        <p>0:18:25.7 Rhiannon: Right, this is a public safety issue, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:18:26.9 Peter: Yeah. But Thomas says, look, it doesn't matter that they followed the guy for five minutes and he drove perfectly, because maybe he was just being cautious because he saw a cop, which like... A couple of things.</p>
                        <p>0:18:41.4 Michael: Look, guys, I don't know if you've ever driven drunk.</p>
                        <p>0:18:44.6 Peter: All my drunk drivers now. The reason the cops are showing up is because they got a tip that they believed implied that this person is inebriated. When you are incapacitated to the point where it is illegal for you to drive, it is not easy to simply fake having motor skills and cognitive function for extended periods of time. Your fucking neurons are slowing down, dude.</p>
                        <p>0:19:09.0 Rhiannon: Right, like, you know, put driving aside. Like if you're just chilling and you're high or you're drunk, and then all of a sudden you tell yourself like act cool, act cool, dude, act cool. You can't do it.</p>
                        <p>0:19:22.0 Peter: How often does it work?</p>
                        <p>0:19:24.7 Rhiannon: Just sitting on the couch, you can't do it normal.</p>
                        <p>0:19:26.8 Peter: Look, a drunk person can probably in certain circumstances with adrenaline snap to for brief periods of time. Five minutes is not a brief period of time.</p>
                        <p>0:19:38.7 Michael: If you're hammered enough to be running car off the road, that's...</p>
                        <p>0:19:42.2 Peter: And all of that to say, look, if these people were drunk, the cops almost certainly would have seen it in a five-minute window of following them. What Thomas actually says is "extended observation of an allegedly drunk driver might eventually dispel a reasonable suspicion of intoxication, but the five-minute period in this case hardly sufficed in that regard." What he's saying is, look, five minutes isn't enough to know whether he's drunk or not. Here's the fucking thing, though, they didn't just have five minutes. They had as long as they wanted to observe this car. They only took five minutes because they didn't feel like waiting anymore, and then they just pulled the dude over, got lucky and found some weed. So how the fuck can the fact that the cops only observed them for a few minutes before deciding to pull them over make this stop more constitutional than if they observed it for longer?</p>
                        <p>0:20:38.5 Rhiannon: I just realized how stupid that is, oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>0:20:41.9 Michael: It's so dumb.</p>
                        <p>0:20:42.3 Peter: This is sort of the heart of why this case sucks so much, in my view. If cops got a tip that some guy had a kidnapped child in his trunk, then there may be an argument for allowing cops to pull that guy over immediately, because there's a big risk in not doing so, and the cop cannot directly observe the illegal activity.</p>
                        <p>0:21:02.6 Michael: Oh, they're driving like they got a body in the trunk.</p>
                        <p>0:21:08.7 Peter: In this case, though, someone is saying essentially that someone is driving recklessly. That is something that is perfectly ripe for the cops to confirm. If our Constitution means anything, surely it means that the government cannot force you to stop what you were doing just because its agents are too lazy to figure out whether or not you're breaking the law. That's exactly what happened here. They're like, alright, we hear that this guy is maybe driving recklessly, they follow him for five minutes and he's not, and they're like, well, I'm tired of this shit, let's just pull the guy over.</p>
                        <p>0:21:42.4 Michael: This is getting boring.</p>
                        <p>0:21:43.6 Peter: Yeah, so that's it. Those are all of the reasons that Thomas provides for saying that this is a trustworthy tip, it's that the tipster used 911 and that she knew the make and model of the car, and that she appeared to have called the tip in shortly after the incident occurred.</p>
                        <p>0:22:00.2 Rhiannon: You know what, all of those reasons also indicate that someone knew these people and wanted them to get pulled over.</p>
                        <p>0:22:10.1 Peter: That's a great point, 'cause lingering in the back here is the fact that maybe, maybe someone calling 911 and saying, hey, this person was driving recklessly, and then it turns out that when the cop follows them and they're not driving recklessly and then bang, they've got 30 pounds of marijuana, maybe that's not a coincidence. Maybe the caller knew there was marijuana in the car. Now, again, this is speculation, there's no information about this, we don't really know, but it's I think worth considering when you're talking about an anonymous tip.</p>
                        <p>0:22:42.2 Rhiannon: Right. And when you're talking about what the police can do with very initial vague information that's not corroborated.</p>
                        <p>0:22:50.3 Peter: There's a couple of options, right, maybe it was someone who knew them and very much just approved of their drug dealing, maybe it was a rival drug dealer or someone who had an interest in seeing them thwarted in their effort to transport the marijuana. But it doesn't really matter which one of those it is or whatever, because the bottom line is, if any of that is true, then the tipster is lying and was not run off the road, and the tape is not reliable, and the entire Supreme Court decision is predicated on the idea that it is reliable.</p>
                        <p>0:23:17.9 Michael: Right, and I don't think the Court is actually... Nor are the prosecutors or the cops or anyone is like, missing that point. I think there's a degree to which this opinion is dishonest, and there's like a sort wink wink like, yeah, maybe that was what this sort of tip is, but we're fine getting those sorts of tips 'cause it lets us get marijuana off the street. But if that's the claim, it should be stated and it should be defended, because if you're furthering the interests of a rival gang, for example, I think you're hard-pressed to say that that's actually in the greater public interest and that it's protecting public safety.</p>
                        <p>0:23:55.0 Michael: I don't think that's something that should be blithely accepted because it allows you to get a headline arrest. And I will say, my upstairs neighbors are like, they must be like CrossFit freaks or something, and since the pandemic, with all the gyms closed, they work out constantly, it's like multiple times a day, they're like jumping rope and shit right over my bedroom at 2 AM or... It's bizarre, but I would definitely call in a fake anonymous tip if I thought there was a chance I could get them arrested. 100%.</p>
                        <p>0:24:32.8 Peter: Look, the bottom line is very simple. What Thomas's majority opinion does not address is the fact that a tip being anonymous almost certainly makes it less likely that it is actually true, and like we can speculate about rival drug gangs and shit like that all we want, 'cause it's fun, that bottom line remains true regardless, and Clarence Thomas is basically giving that his blessing. Although in his defense, maybe we can assume that Clarence Thomas, a man who made his marital vows to Ginni Thomas, a QAnon proponent who had a fairly sizeable role in the January 6th insurrection in Washington DC, is perhaps not the foremost scholar on the concept of trustworthiness or reliability.</p>
                        <p>0:25:17.6 Michael: Yeah, I do want to note, like there's a footnote early in the opinion where Thomas says like, look, it's not clear that the tip was actually anonymous, but thanks to some procedural quirks at the very beginning of this case, it has to be treated as anonymous in this case. And I have to say, I think that's doing some work here. Like, for all the talk about treating this as anonymous, a lot of the argument is this sort of hand-waving back during the idea that it wasn't anonymous, oh, look, 911 calls can be traced and blah, blah, blah, blah, technology has advanced so much. And that's just a poor, lazy way to handle an important constitutional issue. Using a case where you suspect the tip wasn't actually anonymous as the use case for setting rules going forward for actually anonymous tips, it's terrible law-making, if you want to call it law-making, it's terrible jurisprudence. However you want to frame it, it's just very bad.</p>
                        <p>0:26:16.1 Peter: I think, Michael, that you're right about how Thomas perceives this. Just to give our listeners some color, basically, what Thomas points out is that we don't actually know if it was an anonymous tip. It is sort of agreed upon by the parties that it was for the sake of procedure. So when the Court evaluates it, the Court has to evaluate it as if it is definitely anonymous. In reality, we don't 100% know, and I think that Thomas thinks that it wasn't, and he's just sort of like, well, this wasn't really an anonymous tip, and that's how he's going. But the law now applies to anonymous tips, so it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if it was or not.</p>
                        <p>0:26:49.0 Peter: And maybe the most important point against the cops here goes completely unaddressed by the majority. The question is whether this tip was enough for the cops to say that they have reasonable suspicion of illegal activity. And like I mentioned, the majority acts as though it's sort of a given that the tip suggested that the driver was drunk. Thomas talks about this as if this is like a matter of intoxication throughout the opinion, but what the 911 call actually said was that this car ran me off the highway, not that the driver seemed drunk or was generally driving erratically. Saying that someone ran you off the road can mean a number of things, it isn't even really saying that the other person broke the law, it might have been an innocent mistake, it might have been a reaction to another driver or a pot hole or an animal.</p>
                        <p>0:27:39.9 Peter: So not only is the tip anonymous, but even if you assume that it's true, it's not clear that it implies that the driver in question broke the law. And what that means is that the Court's holding here is that an anonymous tip stating that someone made a single potentially reckless driving move on the road is enough to make a cop reasonably suspicious that that driver is intoxicated, even if the cop observes them driving perfectly for five minutes afterwards. That is an egregious outcome, even by Supreme Court standards.</p>
                        <p>0:28:16.5 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely, it rubber-stamps bad policing, I think, and it does what we've said the Supreme Court does in a lot of cases having to do with police power, which is take the institution of the Court out of the conversation, out of being an accountability on the massive institution and the massive power of policing. And I think this is a good time to talk a little bit about the Confrontation Clause in the Constitution, because reports that are made by anonymous tipsters bring up this really important constitutional concern for me. So the Confrontation Clause is in the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, and it provides in part that "in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him," and so generally that means that if you are accused of a crime that you have the right to have a face-to-face confrontation with witnesses who are offering testimonial evidence against you.</p>
                        <p>0:29:24.8 Peter: The right to confront your accusers.</p>
                        <p>0:29:26.8 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. And that's important for a lot of reasons, and is a long-standing legal tradition. It comes from English common law, it comes from Roman law, that you have the right to defend yourself openly...</p>
                        <p>0:29:39.7 Peter: It also comes from the streets, if someone was like, hey, Rhiannon, did you punch that chick? You'd be like, who the fuck said that? Who said I punched her?</p>
                        <p>0:29:46.3 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly. And take my name out your goddamn mouth. Right, it makes logical sense. This is how... This is how like accusations work. So the importance of the Confrontation Clause I think is clear, but can sometimes need a little bit of explanation. Confrontation ensures reliability in the adjudication process. You can trust that someone was given fair proceedings, someone who was accused of a crime. When you require that an accuser must state that accusation publicly, that they are subject to cross-examination and that their testimony and their presentation can be scrutinized for reliability. Now, the Confrontation Clause applies to trials, if you take a case all the way to a trial, but that idea of scrutinizing evidence for reliability and to scrutinize a witness for their reliability and the truth of what they're saying, that concept is absolutely at play when cops are gathering evidence.</p>
                        <p>0:30:51.5 Rhiannon: Cops write into their reports, "this person doesn't seem credible, it seems like this person is lying, or this person seems credible because of all of this corroborating evidence." Anonymous tips allow for skipping over that accountability mechanism, and I think when we're talking about originalism and originalists' interpretation of the Constitution, it's something that's always struck me is that literally four out of the ten Amendments in the Bill of Rights are explicitly about the rights of criminal defendants.</p>
                        <p>0:31:24.2 Peter: That's why they're treated so well in this country.</p>
                        <p>0:31:27.2 Rhiannon: If you're not counting the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, which are just sort of broadly about non-enumerated rights anyway, you're left with eight Amendments in the Bill of Rights that enumerate specific rights. Four of those passed are about the rights of criminal defendants. So originalists, the Founding Fathers must have been concerned about something really fucking important, and Clarence Thomas is just like, it has nothing to say about that. And that leads me to sort of Supreme Court treatment of the Fourth Amendment more specifically.</p>
                        <p>0:32:03.5 Rhiannon: The Fourth Amendment protects everybody from unreasonable searches and seizures and what's happened in the post-Earl Warren Supreme Court era, so the last, whatever, 60 years, what's happened is that Fourth Amendment jurisprudence from the Supreme Court actually has failed to protect us in that original vision of the Fourth Amendment, and actually just serves to tell cops now how to lie and how to present their cases and how to write their reports so that it won't be scrutinized by courts. When you're just sort of rubber-stamping and blindly affirming expansive discretion to the police and giving them more and more power, when courts should be the accountability mechanism, taking a much more skeptical approach to what cops are doing, that's a problem. And I think this case exemplifies that perfectly.</p>
                        <p>0:33:04.1 Peter: One of the first times I saw a police report, which is just a tiny slice of your life, Rhiannon, the cop said, "I was reasonably suspicious that X, Y, Z." And I was like, "Wait, can he just say that?" Like, you know... Yeah, it's the Supreme Court in the '60s said you have to have reasonable suspicion. And then the cop's just like, "Yeah, I was reasonably suspicious," just mimicking the language.</p>
                        <p>0:33:25.2 Michael: And then later on that gets expounded on, they say particularized facts, and so they learn which facts count. And cops pay attention to these cases, and they write their reports to conform to the standards set forth, but that's report writing. They don't conform their behavior to them, they just learn how to describe their behavior in a way that puts them above judicial review.</p>
                        <p>0:33:54.1 Rhiannon: That's the perfect articulation, Michael, and I think when you talk to any public defender, for sure I've said this before, any public defender in the country will say cops lie in every single case. And that's exactly the problem, is that the law here, Supreme Court jurisprudence on the Fourth Amendment has not held police to account in terms of their behavior, it has only held police to account in terms of what they report they saw or what they report they gathered in terms of evidence. And this case right here, it helps police lie. You're giving them massive power to attribute their own sort of illegal stop of somebody or their use of an informant, and you're allowing them to attribute it to "anonymous tips" for which they don't have to show any proof or corroboration. And so you're further dodging the protections in the Constitution against unreasonable searches and seizures and against the Confrontation Clause.</p>
                        <p>0:34:53.1 Peter: Yeah. Scalia's dissent in this case actually has a moment of legal realism where he's discussing all these things that we're discussing, and he explicitly says, I think it's page 1 of his dissent, he's like, cops read these decisions closely, so that they know exactly what boundaries they can push. And again, it's hard to overstate how true that is. I do a little bit of research for this podcast, and part of that is I will Google our cases to see if there's like any interesting Law Review articles or blog posts, and I'll search for podcasts to see if any other podcast has covered it and make sure we're not treading on the same ground or whatever.</p>
                        <p>0:35:29.0 Peter: And every time we do a cop episode, I will find the same thing. Podcasts by cops for cops that explain in five minutes the Supreme Court decision with sort of an emphasis on like, here's what this means you can do. It's bizarre, but there's a whole ecosystem of it. They're talking to each other about this shit, about how to abuse it, and that's why these decisions need to do more than just sort of give rules to cops, they need to actually check the power of cops.</p>
                        <p>0:36:01.2 Peter: In our fifth episode, which we mentioned earlier, Terry v. Ohio, we talked at length about the propensity of cops to lie under oath in order to justify their own actions as well as to support convictions. It's been almost a year since that episode aired, so worth reiterating a couple of points. Research and reporting has shown the police lying under oath, which they have a name for, police call it testilying, is a serious and ongoing problem. So any time the Court allows cops to operate on their own discretion, that's what you're risking, you're placing the public trust in an institution that we verifiably know we cannot trust.</p>
                        <p>0:36:39.2 Peter: So if you accept that the police are not reliably honest in testimony, which is frankly just empirically true, think about what this case can do for them. This is the Court saying, hey, all you need to pull someone over, any citizen, or to stop and frisk them, is an anonymous tip that says that they maybe did something wrong. Think about what a dishonest person could do with that standard. Think about what a cop who is trying to justify after the fact a stop could say. All you need now is to say that you had a tip, and who was the source? Oh, can't tell you. This is a dishonest person's dream.</p>
                        <p>0:37:26.2 Peter: It's hard to impress upon people. There's something that I, even I, before talking to you, Rhi, extensively, probably underestimated, but I'd also done... I've done some class action litigation about public defense, and the extent to which police officers are lying really cannot be impressed upon our listeners enough. It is enormous. We're not talking about bad apples, we're not even talking about 50% of a department, we're talking about situations where every time you're unsure about a detail, it is commonplace and accepted and encouraged implicitly and explicitly to lie.</p>
                        <p>0:38:06.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's exactly right. And I think what I wish listeners would take away from this kind of episode is how the Supreme Court takes part in that culture-building, because what they do with a case like this is open the door to so much more lying. When you tell police that an anonymous tip is enough to pull somebody over, an anonymous tip is enough to stop you on the street and frisk you, you are opening the flood gates in terms of how police are going to use "anonymous tips" in their investigations.</p>
                        <p>0:38:41.7 Rhiannon: As a public defender, I have not an insignificant amount of cases at any given time that originate out of an anonymous tip. You don't ever find out who that person is, you don't ever know the circumstances of the report, you don't know anything about that person and about how this information originated against somebody who is now facing the full weight of the state, the full violence of the criminal punishment system, based on a complete question mark. And that I think brings me back to the goals of policing, like the way this jurisprudence has shifted and contributed to this culture where police [0:39:24.6] ____ just a ton of stops, pulling people over all the time, arresting them based on jack shit, and that being the goal of policing rather than public safety. The role of cops, ostensibly, is to keep us safe, and this case expands the power of police to stop someone who is driving perfectly.</p>
                        <p>0:39:48.8 Rhiannon: How does that serve public safety? At the heart of this case is a regular 911 call, reporting some alleged erratic driving, and the Supreme Court takes it and turns it into a massive gift to police in terms of their ability now to build a huge tip solicitation infrastructure, where police are constantly pushing the boundaries on what they can do, by saying it's for public safety. Police departments all over the country now solicit anonymous tips. There are tip lines that you can call, and you don't have to say who you are, and you don't have to say why you're reporting something, and you never have to show up in a court of law, it is just for the anonymous reporting of crimes. And so then as a step off, when we know what the police do on communities of color, which is enact violence constantly, it just makes me fucking sick like to think about this case and what it did for police.</p>
                        <p>0:40:49.5 Michael: Right, right. And it's like, with the old stop and frisk cases, at least ostensibly, the cop is supposed to have witnessed something, something that would raise their suspicion. In this case, not only do they not have to have witnessed anything, they could witness perfect behavior. And they don't even have to have a tip alleging criminal behavior, they just need a tip that alleges something that sounds like it might be criminal behavior, maybe, or it might imply future criminal behavior. And on those grounds, they can stop you. It is so lax, there's so much discretion being given to cops here, and you know, the bottom line is we know what cops do with their discretion. They fucking abuse it.</p>
                        <p>0:41:31.5 Peter: And the one thing we haven't said that we should say, that we always have to say in cases like this, is I think a lot of people just sort of roll their eyes at stuff like this and say, well, these guys had 30 pounds of marijuana, so who gives a shit? And the bottom line here is that, of course, they had drugs on them, because if they didn't, they wouldn't have appealed, they wouldn't have had any reason to appeal. If the cops had just stopped them, bothered them for no reason and let them go, they wouldn't have sued. They're suing because they don't want to get in trouble for the 30 pounds of marijuana.</p>
                        <p>0:42:02.4 Peter: That's why every time there's a case like this, they always found something, they always found a gun, they always found some drugs, and it allows people to sort of just ignore it. Well, they were criminals anyway. We're not advocating for a system that is designed to give free rein to criminals, we're advocating for a system that is designed to prevent cops from pulling over whoever the fuck they want, and that's going to include a small percentage of criminals, and it's going to include a huge percentage of people who are just going about their business every single day.</p>
                        <p>0:42:33.3 Michael: Right. It's unfortunately the case that the boundaries of your rights, the specifics of your rights and the boundaries of the state's power over you, are often gonna be decided by criminals, by people who are found with drugs or weapons or committing a crime, sometimes a very heinous one. That shouldn't matter. What should matter is the state's power over you, the way it exercises its monopoly in violence and when it can and cannot exercise that violence.</p>
                        <p>0:43:02.7 Peter: Yeah. And now for a flawless transition. Let's talk about Supreme Court Justices. So as we have noted, Antonin Scalia writes the dissent here. Scalia really has a single area of the law where he's good, and it's the Fourth Amendment, searches and seizures.</p>
                        <p>0:43:21.2 Michael: Yeah, some people give credit for First Amendment, but I think he's pretty just...</p>
                        <p>0:43:25.3 Peter: Yeah, I agree with that. He had a real libertarian streak that left him sort of very skeptical of the ability of police to intrude into citizens' property and into their personal space. That doesn't mean that he was good for criminal defendants' rights generally, his jurisprudence on the rights of defendants in interrogations and on cruel and unusual punishment, for example, horrific, some of the worst in the biz. And I think the best explanation for this is if Justice Scalia could imagine himself or someone he knows being affected by something, then he was very concerned with it. So the ability of police to pull you over is something he's sensitive to, right, it's an experience almost all of us have had.</p>
                        <p>0:44:04.4 Michael: Scalia was known for his excess.</p>
                        <p>0:44:06.9 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:44:07.2 Peter: Yeah. He was also known as a man who drinks, and in his dissent he sort of is like, Clarence Thomas is obviously a fucking straitlaced freak, 'cause he's not drinking much, and Scalia is like correcting him. Scalia's like, no, when you're drunk, bro, let me tell you, you could not drive straight for five minutes, dude. He really relates to this. He's like, are we pulling over everyone who's swerving a little bit? But the further you get from his own personal experience, like an accused person in an interrogation room or on death row, the less he seems to care.</p>
                        <p>0:44:43.9 Peter: Now, you might think that that analysis is speculative and in bad faith, but so is basically everything the man ever wrote, so I don't give a shit.</p>
                        <p>0:44:51.5 Michael: That's right. That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:44:54.5 Peter: And the other interesting thing here is Justice Stephen Breyer joining the conservatives in the majority. Breyer was appointed by President Clinton in 1994. He is now 82 years old. Given the outcome of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decision to stay on the Court rather than give up her seat when she could be replaced by a Democrat, there is growing discussion on when Breyer will step down, and growing pressure on him to do so. This case is a good example of an area where Breyer is, simply put, a conservative Justice.</p>
                        <p>0:45:26.7 Peter: His jurisprudence on the Fourth Amendment is quite bad, and because the Fourth Amendment is an area where Scalia was actually quite good, it was Breyer's vote that often gave the win to conservatives. So it's not just that Breyer should step down because he will be replaced by someone younger, he should step down because he will be replaced by someone better, and you can thank him personally for the freedom that cops have to invade your space in this country.</p>
                        <p>0:45:51.6 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I just want to say, Stephen Breyer, you're a mealy-mouthed fucking worm bitch, and I don't like you. You think you're cute, you think you're very clever on the bench when you're asking questions. You're not funny, you're fucking old and you suck at this. God, can you imagine Stephen Breyer just spending maybe an hour in central booking somewhere at like 2:00 AM, like what that would be like?</p>
                        <p>0:46:18.5 Michael: I cannot.</p>
                        <p>0:46:18.5 Peter: He believes that he could use his logic and reason to get his way out of that situation.</p>
                        <p>0:46:22.4 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. He thinks he's much too smart to ever be arrested.</p>
                        <p>0:46:26.4 Peter: I think that if you look back at the Supreme Court for the last 40 years, there have only been a couple lines of cases that have been consistently liberal. Gay rights in the past 25 years is probably the most prominent one. The Fourth Amendment would have been another, if Stephen Breyer was an actual liberal on it.</p>
                        <p>0:46:45.9 Rhiannon: Really good point, Peter.</p>
                        <p>0:46:47.1 Peter: It's crazy to think about it, but the entire line of cases that has brought us to where we are today in terms of the ability of cops to interfere with your space and person is on the back of Stephen Breyer.</p>
                        <p>0:47:01.4 Rhiannon: Law students, I have a paper idea for you: Stephen Breyer on the Fourth Amendment and how he was a conservative, and it's all his fucking fault.</p>
                        <p>0:47:09.5 Peter: Here's another one: 5-4 and how it's changing the country's view of the law.</p>
                        <p>0:47:15.7 Michael: Alright, now shut the fuck up. I've been trying to say something for 10 minutes and you guys keep interrupting each other while I'm going, "Uh... Uh... "</p>
                        <p>0:47:25.1 Peter: Sorry that we're vibing too hard for you.</p>
                        <p>0:47:29.2 Michael: What I was gonna say is that Stephen Breyer... We keep saying he's a conservative, and I think that's a quirk of American politics, I think that he's very comfortably like a big state liberal. Because of the way race works in America and the way police work in America, it turns out that like the left and liberals have a very civil libertarian streak, but that's not... Like liberalism and the left are often associated with a big, powerful state, a big central government, and a big powerful police force is like, goes well with that. Breyer is very much in that sort of mode, and his trust in the federal government to get the welfare state right and to get all this other stuff right extends to his trust in the police, and that makes him very conservative in a country that's so racially and class stratified, where the police are used to hold the hierarchies in place and hold the poor and minorities down. That's all I wanted to say.</p>
                        <p>0:48:28.0 Rhiannon: Gorgeous. I'm so glad that you asserted yourself.</p>
                        <p>0:48:31.4 Peter: You are welcome.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:48:39.9 Peter: Alright, closing notes: Fuck the police. Next week, United States v. Morrison, a case about the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and how it interacts with interstate commerce. Whoof. I love the law.</p>
                        <p>0:49:00.3 Rhiannon: Titillating. Titillating stuff.</p>
                        <p>0:49:00.6 Peter: What an incredible [0:49:01.6] ____. Rhi, don't mock the episode.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>0:00:00.4 S?: We'll hear argument first today in case 06-278, Morse v. Frederick.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:00:07.8 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about the free speech rights of students. In 2007, the Court ruled in Morse v. Frederick that a high school principal had the right to suspend a student for holding a provocative sign during a school-sponsored outing.</p>
                        <p>0:00:27.4 S?: As the symbolic torch was carried through Juneau, Alaska on its way to the 2002 Olympics, Douglas student Joe Frederick unfurled this banner: "Bong Hits 4 Jesus."</p>
                        <p>0:00:39.3 Leon: The case created a precedent that allows schools to punish students for speech, even when they are not disrupting academic activities. The case also says a lot about whose free speech the Supreme Court really cares about.</p>
                        <p>0:00:51.3 S?: I find it absurdly funny. I was not promoting drugs. I assumed most people would take it as a joke.</p>
                        <p>0:00:56.4 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:01:05.2 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have like a mighty river wound their way over the great rock of our liberty, reducing it over many years to a canyon of despair. I am Peter. I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:19.8 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:21.5 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:23.5 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>0:01:24.2 Peter: Alright, this is our first episode of the Joseph Robinette Biden presidency.</p>
                        <p>0:01:29.3 Rhiannon: Robinette.</p>
                        <p>0:01:32.3 Michael: Robinette.</p>
                        <p>0:01:33.1 Rhiannon: You gotta roll that R.</p>
                        <p>0:01:33.4 Peter: Do you?</p>
                        <p>0:01:33.8 Rhiannon: It's a rolled R, for sure.</p>
                        <p>0:01:35.5 Peter: Yeah, it's been an interesting few weeks. Inauguration went off without a hitch. I guess from my perspective, it's time for Stephen Breyer to die or retire.</p>
                        <p>0:01:47.7 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:01:48.7 Rhiannon: That's what Lady Gaga meant when she was singing the national anthem and she pointed at the flag... The flag was still there. What that means is Stephen Breyer, retire, you fucking bitch.</p>
                        <p>0:01:48.8 S6: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:01:48.2 S7: That's what Lady Gaga meant when she was singing the national anthem and she pointed at the flag. The flag was still there. What that means is, Stephen Breyer, retire, you fucking bitch.</p>
                        <p>0:01:58.8 Michael: Yeah, if you read between the lines.</p>
                        <p>0:02:00.6 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:02:00.7 Peter: Right. Stephen Breyer, yeah, he should be retiring. It would be a good time. Remember the opening scene of Prometheus?</p>
                        <p>0:02:09.4 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:02:10.3 Peter: Where the alien dude drinks the concoction and then his DNA breaks down and he dies and dissolves into the waterfall?</p>
                        <p>0:02:16.2 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:02:16.3 Peter: If he could do that, that would be cool too.</p>
                        <p>0:02:17.6 Rhiannon: Sure. I would accept, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:02:18.7 Peter: It's... Sacrifice for the greater good, was the theme of that scene, I think.</p>
                        <p>0:02:22.9 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:02:23.3 Peter: I don't know. I didn't really understand Prometheus.</p>
                        <p>0:02:26.2 Michael: The movie doesn't make any sense. But I do think like, look, they just elevated Merrick Garland or pulled him off the Court, and so they'll probably put Ketanji Brown Jackson in his spot, and then in June, July, Breyer retires at the end of the term, and they elevate Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:02:49.9 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:02:51.8 Michael: Inshallah. Inshallah. Please, let's not...</p>
                        <p>0:02:55.9 Peter: Yeah, yeah. I don't think that he should have stepped down by now, but I would like to start the public campaign to pressure him right now.</p>
                        <p>0:03:02.6 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:03:03.2 Rhiannon: Absolutely. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:03:04.0 Michael: Before the next term.</p>
                        <p>0:03:05.7 Rhiannon: Yeah, and that's what J. Lo was doing when she sang, "Let's get loud" in the song, she was talking about making sure that our voices are heard, in particular, Stephen Breyer, retire, bitch.</p>
                        <p>0:03:18.1 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:03:18.2 Rhiannon: That's what she's talking about.</p>
                        <p>0:03:18.3 Peter: See, this is the difference between us. I listen to those songs, but you really hear them.</p>
                        <p>0:03:22.3 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:03:24.5 Peter: So, today's case is Morse v. Frederick. This is a case about free speech. We've done a few episodes about the Court's protection of corporate speech, but this is a different kind of case. This is about the Court's lack of protection for the speech of individuals. This case has a fun set of facts. In 2002, the Olympic torch relay was running through Juneau, Alaska, right by the local Juneau Douglas High School. All of the students and teachers were excused from class to go outside and watch. Joseph Frederick, a high school student, gathered with some friends across the street from the school, and when the torch came by and the TV cameras were on, they unfurled a banner that said "Bong Hits 4 Jesus." That's the number four, by the way. Bong Hits 4 Jesus.</p>
                        <p>0:04:09.6 Rhiannon: Yes, aha, note the stylizing.</p>
                        <p>0:04:11.6 Peter: The principal stormed across the street to seize the banner from them, and then Frederick was suspended from school, and then he sued saying that unfurling a banner that says "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" across from the school during the Olympic torch relay was his right as an American under the First Amendment's protection of free speech.</p>
                        <p>0:04:33.8 Rhiannon: Tell 'em, Joseph.</p>
                        <p>0:04:35.3 Michael: He's fucking correct.</p>
                        <p>0:04:40.0 Peter: And the Supreme Court a few years later in 2007, in a 5-4 decision, disagrees, holding that the student's banner was not protected by the First Amendment.</p>
                        <p>0:04:48.0 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:04:49.6 Peter: So, yeah, this case touches on the conservative vision of social hierarchy, and it also touches on a conservative tendency that we haven't really discussed too much on this podcast, and that's just good old-fashioned puritanical morality. It's about the free speech rights of students, but in a larger sense it's about what you might call the outskirts of free speech, how does the law treat speech that it views as unimportant? How does it treat speech that comes from people who it views as unimportant? So Rhi, if you can give us a little bit of color here, a little more background?</p>
                        <p>0:05:22.5 Rhiannon: Sure, sure. So I think the important facts of the case, are, Peter, you just said them, right? But I have a couple of thoughts that I think are important up top. So, one is, important for listeners, I think, to place themselves in January 2002, in Juneau, Alaska. And I just would like to pose the question, what else are you supposed to do to entertain yourself? You fucking live in Alaska. This is a dream senior prank, and it is a classic example, I think, of pre-internet trolling. So Joseph Frederick, wherever you are today, I'm sure that you're an extremely powerful online poster, and for that I salute you.</p>
                        <p>0:06:08.3 Rhiannon: Like Peter said, classes at Juneau Douglas High School had been dismissed that day and students were to attend the parade, the Olympic torch relay, and that event was considered a school-sponsored event. So as punishment for displaying the banner that said Bong Hits 4 Jesus, the school principal, Deborah Morse, suspended Frederick for 10 days, and officially the school's reason was that Frederick had violated the school policy, which forbade advocacy for the use of illegal drugs. And if I can just maybe take the opportunity to editorialize a bit here, setting aside any legal argument about the permissibility or prohibition on this kind of speech, getting suspended from school for 10 days for doing this is wild to me.</p>
                        <p>0:06:55.4 Rhiannon: That's crazy punitive. That's a harsh punishment. But it is helpful, I think, to illustrate the sort of social moral panics that were prevalent at this time, because you see what it is that squares were getting their panties in a bunch over, and it helps to explain why the suspension was so heavy and then the way a fucking dork like John Roberts is talking about the apparent horror of a poster that says Bong Hits 4 Jesus. So again, this happened in 2002, and throughout the '90s, in particular, American middle class folks had been stoked into terror about so-called super predators. Experts were warning about an explosion of violent juvenile crime committed by black and brown youth, like media portrayals of this phenomenon were calling young people animals and savages, and people were often ascribing drug use or drug-related motives to the incidence of crime among young people.</p>
                        <p>0:07:55.4 Rhiannon: Another thing, people were freaking out about Dungeons and Dragons in the '80s and '90s, Christian groups especially were saying that the game promoted Satanism and witchcraft, murder, suicide among young people, and of course, you have the background since the '70s, really, of the war on drugs, and then in the '80s Nancy Reagan's Just Say No campaign, those ideas had sort of fully permeated public consciousness to the point that people believed largely anecdotal and hyperbolic depictions of drug use.</p>
                        <p>0:08:29.4 Rhiannon: We've previously discussed at length how the Supreme Court has unquestionably employed pseudoscience and propaganda in its opinions, and I think noting what the prominent like folk devils were at this time in American society is helpful when you look at this case and pick apart what kind of rhetorical devices dusty ass John Roberts is using.</p>
                        <p>0:08:51.5 Peter: Another component of the '90s moral panic in this is there was a lot of concern about slogans on t-shirts and stuff that children were wear to school, like if you guys remember the No Fear brand of shirts.</p>
                        <p>0:09:05.8 Rhiannon: Absolutely, yes.</p>
                        <p>0:09:06.9 Michael: I had a sweet note here.</p>
                        <p>0:09:11.1 Peter: Yeah, so some kid shows up to school with like a No Fear shirt and it says "It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog." And I was eight years old, looking at that like, holy shit, that is a bad ass, dude.</p>
                        <p>0:09:25.4 Rhiannon: I will never forget this. My older cousin, this would have been early 2000s, for sure. Limp Bizkit was a popular band, and my cousin got a shirt and wore it to school. The shirt said "I come to school for the nookie." This was very, very scandalous.</p>
                        <p>0:09:46.3 Michael: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>0:09:48.3 Peter: The Simpsons made fun of this in what must have been the mid-90s when Bart wore a shirt that said "down with homework" and it incited an anti-homework riot. And there was this idea that if children are exposed to these sorts of slogans, it will slowly unravel the social fabric that binds students and it will be pure chaos. You will be unable to control them. So that is important background, I think.</p>
                        <p>0:10:15.7 Michael: Before we continue, did you guys do any pranks like Bong Hits 4 Jesus or anything like that?</p>
                        <p>0:10:19.3 Rhiannon: Oh, God, no, I was way too good of a student and kid.</p>
                        <p>0:10:23.3 Peter: I was not a good student, I was an unruly student, for sure, but we didn't do anything on this scale, I don't think. No, I just dealt drugs.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:10:36.2 Michael: We did, it's not as overt, but we had these big senior pictures, one like everybody just sitting in the bleachers and one everybody being crazy, you know, whatever. And for the crazy one, some of my friends unfurled a banner that said "Number one stunner," which was the name of the three foot bong that was very popular and passed around at all the parties. So it was more of an inside jokes, but everybody in the class itself knew exactly what that was.</p>
                        <p>0:11:09.7 Rhiannon: Being a kid is cool.</p>
                        <p>0:11:12.5 Peter: So let's talk a little bit about the law here. This is a free speech case, First Amendment free speech, and more specifically, this is about student free speech. So as you probably know, the First Amendment prevents the government from unduly abridging your speech. And so at some point, someone said, well, hold on. Doesn't that mean that public schools can't infringe upon the speech of their students? And there's sort of a tension there, right, like the First Amendment says that you have the right to free speech, but public schools also have a need and a responsibility to regulate the student conduct to some degree.</p>
                        <p>0:11:42.8 Peter: So it was for a long time unclear exactly how much the First Amendment applied in the classroom. And in 1969, in a case called Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the Court said that actually, yeah, students do have some free speech rights as long as their speech does not cause a "substantial disruption" to schooling. And in that case, students who wore black arm bands to protest the Vietnam War had been disciplined and then they said that that was unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court agreed.</p>
                        <p>0:12:13.0 Peter: So that's the standard that the Supreme Court is applying from that point onward: Students are allowed to exercise their free speech as long as it is not "substantially disrupting" the school environment. And then in the '80s, there was a case called Bethel School District number 403 v. Fraser, where a student gave a student body campaign speech that was almost entirely a lengthy and fairly obvious sexual metaphor, and the Supreme Court there said, okay, well, it's not disruptive, but it's too sexually vulgar. The Constitution does not protect this level of horniness.</p>
                        <p>0:12:49.5 Rhiannon: You can't keep saying how long and hard you're gonna work for the student body.</p>
                        <p>0:12:54.5 Peter: Right, and that is basically what the speech was. There were other student free speech cases here and there, but this is the basic law that you're dealing with: Students in public schools do have free speech rights, but it can't be too disruptive to the classroom and apparently it cannot be too sexually vulgar. So let's talk about this case. Is holding up a banner that says Bong Hits 4 Jesus across from the school during the Olympic torch race too disruptive to be protected speech, or is it in fact exactly what our countrymen died for on the shores of Normandy?</p>
                        <p>0:13:24.8 Michael: That's right, Peter. The latter.</p>
                        <p>0:13:29.2 Peter: In a 5-4 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court says that this is not protected free speech. So the first question addressed by the opinion is whether Frederick was at school at all. Frederick says, hey, look, I was across the street from the school. He hadn't actually gone to school that day yet, he went straight to the place across the street, so he was saying I wasn't really at school. And that's important because, of course, students have fewer free speech protections when they're at school. So Robert says, look, if you're at a school event among students, you're at school, like the details don't matter that much.</p>
                        <p>0:14:04.8 Peter: And frankly, I tend to agree, although I think Roberts is over-simplifying it, it wasn't really a school event, it was an independent event that the school was attending. I do tend to agree that it's splitting hairs too much to say that he wasn't at school. So in the opinion, so far so good, but the next section is where Roberts really starts to go off of the rails. Again, the principal claimed to have disciplined Frederick because she believed him to be advocating illegal drug use. So there's an initial question of whether that's a reasonable interpretation of the banner. The banner says Bong Hits 4 Jesus. The kid says he saw it on a snowboard sticker and thought it was funny, and he wanted to get on TV. It's an on its face absurd, intentionally silly phrase.</p>
                        <p>0:14:49.8 Peter: So is it advocating illegal drug use? Roberts engages in an extremely funny textual analysis where he tries to break down exactly what it means, and he's taking the term bong hits and then trying to add language that it might be implying. And he's like, well, it could mean, take bong hits or bong hits are a good thing. Roberts concludes by saying that this is, quote, "a pro-drug banner." Now, I'll tell you one interesting thing, which is that when trying to break down what the banner means, Roberts never mentions the 4 Jesus part.</p>
                        <p>0:15:30.8 Peter: In fact, not once in his opinion, aside from when he initially describes the banner, does Roberts mention the 4 Jesus at all, and that's probably because if you read the whole phrase, it starts to sound a lot less like advocating for drugs and a lot more like a purposefully absurdist message that happens to involve drugs. No one actually thinks that this kid is advocating that one should take bong hits to honor our Lord Jesus Christ. And by the way, if he was, that would probably be protected religious speech, which is even more constitutional.</p>
                        <p>0:16:04.9 Peter: Justice Stevens writes the dissent and he says, "The notion that the message on this banner would actually persuade either the average student or even the dumbest one to change his or her behavior is most implausible."</p>
                        <p>0:16:18.5 Rhiannon: Got his ass. I love that so much.</p>
                        <p>0:16:22.4 Michael: So good.</p>
                        <p>0:16:22.4 Peter: I want to point out that I don't think that this is like super open and shut, there's a case to be made that this is in some abstract, vague way promoting smoking weed, but I do think that Robert's evasion of the actual content of the banner is telling, because he obviously doesn't want to address the nuance here.</p>
                        <p>0:16:42.4 Rhiannon: Exactly, totally.</p>
                        <p>0:16:43.1 Michael: Right. And related to that, one point to hit, I think, is that the concern driving this case, why make this a cause, is actually that just like religious Christians are simply offended by seeing Jesus's name taken in vain, and very provocatively so. And they're just trying to impose that on everyone else, it's that evangelical sort of dominance, cultural dominance, but that's not a basis for regulating speech, the fact that some Christian people are offended, and so the Court has to dodge that because if they start talking about the 4 Jesus part, that sort of seeps in. And look, you know, this could be read as a sincere message about love and community, supposed values evinced by Jesus, let's all smoke the peace pipe together. Is peace pipe problematic?</p>
                        <p>0:17:34.3 Michael: If it is, to our [0:17:36.3] ____ listeners, I apologize.</p>
                        <p>0:17:37.9 Peter: This is literally the second time on the podcast we've said it, so I hope not.</p>
                        <p>0:17:44.9 Michael: But look, pot in America has been associated with pacifism for decades, right, back to the Vietnam War at the very least. And this is right in the middle of... The war in Afghanistan is a few months old, there's a lot of talk of other war in the air, right, like the Axis of Evil speech is five days after he does this, so I don't think that's a crazy read on it. Bong hits instead of bombs for Jesus. Because that was the selling of the Iraq War and Afghanistan War, people were talking about it explicitly as Christianity versus the militant Islam, the inherently violent Islam.</p>
                        <p>0:18:23.0 Michael: So yeah, at the very least, it could be read... If you're gonna do these textual analyses like Roberts does, it could be read as a core political speech, a core religious speech. But they don't want to do that. They just want to skip it so that they can focus on the mention of drugs.</p>
                        <p>0:18:39.2 Peter: Yeah, exactly. So turning back to the opinion, now we get to sort of the heart of the matter. Can the school, under the First Amendment, discipline Frederick for advocating the use of illegal drugs? And Roberts says, "Of course you can, yeah." And this is part of why Roberts evading the nuance of the banner is so important, because it's a lot easier to say the school can discipline him for promoting illegal drug use than it is to say the school can discipline him for holding a silly banner that maybe could be interpreted by some people as promoting smoking marijuana.</p>
                        <p>0:19:12.0 Rhiannon: Yeah. And Roberts goes on this really lengthy discussion, it's straight out of 1985, about the dangers of drug use, so brace yourselves for the following horrifying statistics. He says, "About half of American 12th graders have used an illicit drug, as have more than a third of 10th graders and about one-fifth of 8th graders. Nearly one in four 12th graders has used an illicit drug in the past month." Gasp for emphasis. This is where it's worth pointing out, I think, that Roberts only ever talks about illegal drugs like categorically, but of course, like any functioning member of society in 2007 knew that marijuana is a uniquely safe drug, and it's not like all other drugs. Not to mention that there's zero reason to believe that a banner that says Bong Hits 4 Jesus would have any impact at all on drug use at this school. All this is, is puritanical, pearl-clutching bullshit.</p>
                        <p>0:20:17.4 Peter: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:20:18.3 Michael: And Rhi said this is straight out of 1985, but if you ask me, the government telling you what you can and can't say is straight out of 1984. Boom.</p>
                        <p>0:20:32.1 Peter: Unbelievable.</p>
                        <p>0:20:34.2 Rhiannon: Got 'em, Orwell.</p>
                        <p>0:20:39.8 Peter: I'd like to take a step back here and talk about free speech under the First Amendment. The law looks at different types of speech restrictions differently. There are what we call time, place and manner restrictions, which restrict when and where speech can occur, and those are given a lot of leeway by the courts. So the government can say, "Okay, you can protest, but you need permits, and you can't do it at 2 AM and wake everyone up," right? It's mostly logistical. And what the courts are saying is, "Look, you can restrict speech as long as you are allowing it to happen in some way, shape or form."</p>
                        <p>0:21:13.4 Peter: But then there are content restrictions, which are restrictions on the type of speech you're allowed to make. And those restrictions are very rarely upheld, for an obvious reason. The core of free speech as a concept is that you can say what you'd like to say. So for the government to say, "Well, no, no, no, you can't say that," that strikes at the very heart of the ideal. And that's what we're talking about here. The school isn't saying you can't hold a banner up or you can't hold a banner up over there, they're saying, you can't hold a banner up if it says that.</p>
                        <p>0:21:44.8 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. And I think to let the government, even a school, control what you say, the content of your speech, that's a dangerous path to go down. Like the idea that this speech is harmful is really abstract, it's certainly not violent, so it can't be said to be promoting violence, it could maybe be said that there's this distant chance that the message could cause someone to contemplate smoking one of the least harmful illegal drugs on the planet. But is that the kind of speech you want the government to be able to regulate? That doesn't make sense.</p>
                        <p>0:22:20.8 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:22:20.8 Peter: There's this point that's sort of implicitly made by the majority in the concurrences here. They're saying, "Look, in Tinker, that case from the '60s, those kids were protesting the Vietnam War. That's like important, heady stuff. And this banner, this is just not important." And that's sort of a big part of the opinion here. And this stands out to me for a very simple reason, which is one of the primary purposes of free speech is that it's not the prerogative of the government to decide what is or what is not important, and that includes the Supreme Court. And it might be worth noting here that as absurd as the Bong hits 4 Jesus banner is, if it can be read by the majority to be promoting marijuana use, it can just as easily be read as promoting marijuana legalization, and that would be an unequivocally political statement that the government would not be able to suppress.</p>
                        <p>0:23:06.9 Rhiannon: Totally.</p>
                        <p>0:23:08.0 Peter: This might seem like too much of a reach, but I want to talk about it for a second. When you see people who have marijuana leaf t-shirts or stickers or whatever, what are they actually saying? Are they signaling that they like weed? Yeah, of course, to a degree, that's obviously true, but a lot of people like cocaine and heroin, so why don't you see themed paraphernalia for them?</p>
                        <p>0:23:27.3 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:23:29.1 Peter: Right? I think the big reason is simple, people who put weed leaves on their snowboards and whatever, aren't just saying they like weed, they're making a statement that they believe that it's okay, that they believe that they should be able to do it, and that they should be able to announce that they do it and not take shit for that. It's in many cases an implicit statement that our laws concerning marijuana should change, or that our social attitudes concerning marijuana should change. Is it purposefully fun and silly to a degree? Yes, but it's just as much a political statement.</p>
                        <p>0:23:57.9 Peter: You see the similar deployment of iconography by people who are into guns on the right, right? If I want to make a comparison on the other side of the spectrum. The culture is simultaneously about enjoying guns and also about making a political statement. And I'm not trying to get too melodramatic about this kid's dumb banner, but what I'm saying is that the line between absurdity and a serious political statement is often a lot less clear than you might initially think, and we should be careful before we let the government start treading all over that line.</p>
                        <p>0:24:25.7 Michael: Right, and like earlier, we talked about the context of religiosity and warmongering that was in the air, but also there's a far more nuanced message here than just do illegal drugs. Some other context worth considering is just that this was being broadcast literally all over the world. It's the Olympics, everybody's watching, and there's this inherent statement, which I think is reflected in this lawsuit itself about free speech itself, that this is a country where you can hold up a dumb sign like Bong Hits 4 Jesus. And that could be received as not just absurd or funny by citizens of other countries, but as an expression of freedom and liberty that they might not have themselves.</p>
                        <p>0:25:07.5 Rhiannon: Totally. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:25:08.9 Michael: It's like an important core value here.</p>
                        <p>0:25:11.2 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:11.5 Peter: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:25:13.3 Michael: Except apparently we don't have them, it turns out.</p>
                        <p>0:25:18.0 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:18.6 Michael: So I also want to... Continuing from our lack of liberty, we should talk about Thomas's concurrence, 'cause this shit is crazy.</p>
                        <p>0:25:29.1 Rhiannon: This is a step inside the mind of somebody... Wow.</p>
                        <p>0:25:34.8 Michael: It is not pretty, and it's also not honest, it is like a phenomenally dishonest opinion. The basic gist is that Thomas doesn't believe students should have any free speech rights when they're in school, he doesn't think those kids who wore black arm bands to oppose the Vietnam War in the '60s should have been allowed to do that. He wants that case overturned, he's an originalist, so he thinks we should base our analysis of what's allowed by the Constitution on what people were doing around the time of the Founding.</p>
                        <p>0:26:05.8 Michael: Thomas says in 1820, if a student was out of line, a teacher could take a belt with nails in it and just whip you in the back.</p>
                        <p>0:26:17.3 Peter: Which is proof that students shouldn't have free speech rights now. You can't argue with that.</p>
                        <p>0:26:25.8 Michael: It's worth noting that pretty much everybody agrees that the First Amendment is much broader now and provides much more speech protections for everyone than it did at the time of the Founding. That's just like a fact. You learn that in law school. It's also a pretty uncontroversial opinion that that's a good thing, and we should not wind back the clock. But Clarence Thomas is like, "I agree and disagree. Free speech is far more protective of expression now, and we should wind back the clock." All of his historical analysis is done by looking at regular practice in schools prior to 1850, which like, okay, if you're an originalist, that kind of makes sense, except that the First Amendment didn't apply to the states prior to 1850. And he even says that, he recognizes that, and in fact, the First Amendment wasn't fully incorporated against the states until 1925, so who fucking cares what was happening in 1840, how does that have any relevance to how the First Amendment works here.</p>
                        <p>0:27:26.0 Michael: It's totally nonsense. And so what does he say is going on in these schools that he thinks is constitutionally permissible? He says: "The earliest public schools, teachers taught and students listened, teachers commanded and students obeyed. Teachers did not rely solely on the power of ideas to persuade, they relied on discipline to maintain order." And if that sounds sort of fucking authoritarian to you, you should know that he uses the phrase "maintain order" at least two other times in this opinion. It's just...</p>
                        <p>0:28:03.9 Rhiannon: God, just addicted to rigid social hierarchy for no reason, and pointing to this invented tradition again as the model that we should be emulating. For what? Like shit was bad back then, bro.</p>
                        <p>0:28:20.8 Peter: The idea that kids were not misbehaving in the 1800s, even if you give credence to the idea that our constitutional interpretation should somehow derive from what was happening in a classroom in the early 1800s, which by the way, it's like a classroom of only white boys led by whatever woman in town is a widow, just like your husband dies and you're like, "Don't worry, Mary, we'll find you some purpose, you will teach these children." And then the kids fucking sit down and they learn about fucking alchemy or whatever, I don't know, whatever they thought was true back in the 1800s.</p>
                        <p>0:29:04.9 Peter: And like Clarence Thomas for some reason has this vision of this time that is this pristine vision of how children should be learning. It's fucking embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>0:29:15.6 Michael: Anybody who's read Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn knows that's absolute bullshit. There's one scene where Tom Sawyer's like carrying around a dead cat or something, and it's like... I don't think it's ever explained, it's just like left to your imagination, what the fuck he was up to.</p>
                        <p>0:29:30.8 Rhiannon: Right, the idea that kids were organically good back then is a total lie. I mean, the classic example of misbehavior and a prank on a teacher is putting a pin or something sharp in her chair. Kids were straight up assaulting their teachers, okay?</p>
                        <p>0:29:51.6 Michael: Maiming them. Causing physical pain. Yeah, but so it's worth asking, though, what does Thomas mean by maintain order? Because if wearing a black armband is disorder, it's not like unruly, that's not loud, that's not running around or breaking things, it's just putting a fucking arm band on. Like, what is disorder in his mind? It's basically accepting the idea that any expression of a contrary or subversive opinion is inherently disordered.</p>
                        <p>0:30:27.3 Peter: Yeah. The classic conservative position, which is everything that happened in the '60s and onward has been a horrible mistake. We should, by total coincidence, go right back to right before the Civil Rights movement, that's when things were spot on.</p>
                        <p>0:30:43.5 Michael: Or in this case, right before Civil War Amendments.</p>
                        <p>0:30:48.2 Rhiannon: Yeah, even further.</p>
                        <p>0:30:51.7 Michael: Jesus Christ, man.</p>
                        <p>0:30:53.6 Peter: So I mentioned earlier that the legal test for student free speech is the substantial disruption test. If student speech is not a substantial disruption to the educational process, it is supposedly protected under the First Amendment, but like I mentioned, there was a case in the '80s about a student who gave a vulgar student election speech. The Supreme Court in that case said, well, no, it's not a substantial disruption, but it's too lewd, so we don't think that's protected speech.</p>
                        <p>0:31:18.3 Peter: And this case is very similar. Roberts does not say that this is disruptive, he just says, well, look, you can't say that, it's about bong, you can't say bongs. So in 1969, the Court had established a very simple test: You can say what you'd like as long as it's not disruptive. But ever since then, every time the conservatives on the Court have seen some new student speech that they didn't like, but that isn't actually disruptive, they just make a new rule up to ban that too. If the rule is that you can't say anything that's disruptive, and the Court just makes up a new rule every time they see some speech they personally don't like, then there really is no rule. You can add that to the laundry list of examples of how the conservatives claim to be just like passively and objectively interpreting the law is absolute bullshit.</p>
                        <p>0:32:04.1 Peter: And one final thought I have here is maybe slightly less academic, but it really feels to me like this opinion goes to the heart of the basic premise of freedom from the government. If you're doing something that doesn't hurt anybody, they should have to leave you alone. I think that's true whether you're at school or anywhere else. If you're not hurting anybody, you ain't done nothing wrong. That is just morality 101, baby. From Jesus to Gandhi, right across the board. But conservatives, they don't really believe in freedom in any general sense. They believe in traditional hierarchies and morality derived from authority.</p>
                        <p>0:32:41.4 Peter: When they say freedom, they mean freedom from liberal interference with what they believe to be the natural order. That's why their perception of who should be brutalized by cops is just so completely dependent on the context, because their beliefs are not about ideological notions of freedom, their beliefs are about who has power and who should have power. And when they see someone who they don't believe should have power try to exercise influence, they don't care about that person's freedom. It's a consistent belief structure, if you view it as one that's about power rather than anything particularly ideological.</p>
                        <p>0:33:17.2 Rhiannon: Right. And you can see this in their rhetoric. When it comes to the free speech of the powerful, they speak breathlessly in flowery language, and there are examples from lots of different cases of this kind of treatment. Justice Kennedy in Citizens United said, "Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people. The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it."</p>
                        <p>0:33:53.5 Rhiannon: In a case called McConnell v. FEC, Justice Scalia said, "There is no such thing as too much speech." And Roberts himself, John Roberts, said in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, he was quoting another case and he said, "First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive." And then back in McConnell v. FEC, Justice Kennedy again, "The First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free to use new forms and new forums for the expression of ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people and the government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it."</p>
                        <p>0:34:36.1 Peter: Wow, beautiful.</p>
                        <p>0:34:36.8 Rhiannon: Thanks, boys.</p>
                        <p>0:34:39.6 Michael: Sounds great.</p>
                        <p>0:34:42.1 Peter: Yeah. So those quotes, if you're wondering, that's how the conservatives on the Court talk about free speech when what it means by free speech is the right of corporations to engage in unfettered political advertising, which is what all of those cases are about. That sort of rhetoric is conspicuously absent from this case, which is a case that's much closer to what I think most people conceptualize as their actual right to free speech, the right to hold up a sign that says whatever you want it to say. By the way, holding up a sign is also something that anyone can do.</p>
                        <p>0:35:12.6 Peter: Contrast that with spending millions of dollars on political advertising, which might be something you can do constitutionally, but it's not something that I think any of our listeners realistically could actually do, even if they wanted to.</p>
                        <p>0:35:26.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, we've talked before about you have to have access to a right and to your freedoms in order for that to really be real.</p>
                        <p>0:35:36.3 Peter: Yeah, and if you've got a marker and some poster board, you can do this, right? You can hold up a sign that says "Bong Hits 4 Jesus."</p>
                        <p>0:35:42.3 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:35:44.1 Peter: When it's the ultra-wealthy dictating the shape of our political discourse, the Court just goes to the mats for their rights to do it. This is what our democracy is built on, right? But when an average person wants to express themselves in a very simple way, to the Court that is and will always be just rabble-rousing. I think that's the bottom line here, and that's why their view of social hierarchy and the Thomas concurrence is so important to this stuff. All of this bullshit about what students should be able to say and the right of the school to control them is always gonna be secondary to the fact that the Justices just don't have that much concern for people who aren't that powerful.</p>
                        <p>0:36:23.8 Peter: They were never gonna view subversive speech as being particularly important. They will always view it with skepticism. Thomas is still saying that those kids from 1969 should not have been able to wear arm bands to school that signal their opposition to the Vietnam War because it's subversive, and conservatives naturally have this tendency to oppose subversion.</p>
                        <p>0:36:47.0 Michael: Right, and it's subversive to the very power structure that empowers them.</p>
                        <p>0:36:50.9 Rhiannon: Yes, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:36:52.9 Michael: That they rely on, that they're a product of.</p>
                        <p>0:36:56.4 Peter: Yes, absolutely. Earlier, we were talking about the sort of gray area here, right? There's a link between this sort of silly rhetoric about weed, and more serious statements about weed and about drug use and about freedom. This incident happens in 2002. This case is handed down in 2007. Here we are in 2021, and legalization across the country feels like an inevitability. And a big part of that is that in the early 2000s, you had a protracted movement, and a lot of which involved this sort of fun but subversive speech that was meant to poke at the traditional understanding of marijuana as dangerous. And you see the Court sort of taking a stance that it... Of course, yeah, we're just gonna grant that it's dangerous, right? And schools of course should be able to push against illegal drug use. But this stuff is important in the aggregate. You see this sort of speech build up to become the actual law in our country. And it did so to a large degree by convincing people that this is in fact relatively harmless.</p>
                        <p>0:38:04.4 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:38:05.1 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:38:05.9 Rhiannon: You can say that there was a strategy of juxtaposing how harmless, how fun smoking weed can be with how seriously people in power were demonizing it and talking about how it was so dangerous.</p>
                        <p>0:38:19.1 Peter: Yeah, and we're talking about something that might seem in a very discrete way to be unimportant. Whether or not this kid got suspended from school, certainly in and of itself, probably the least important case we've tackled, but this is not about this kid. It's not even just about free speech. The rhetoric that is being used by the Court here, the idea that the government should be able to drop the hammer on people for expressing these sorts of viewpoints is deeply intertwined with the idea that people should have to go to prison for possession of small amounts of marijuana. The impact of this sort of cultural viewpoint, the conservative view of drugs at this point in time is responsible for immense human suffering. And that's exactly why this sort of speech is important.</p>
                        <p>0:39:07.7 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:39:13.5 Michael: Well, I'll tell you what, right after this, I'm gonna go take a bong hit and I will do it in Jesus' name.</p>
                        <p>0:39:18.8 Rhiannon: Thank you, Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:39:19.5 Peter: Amen.</p>

                        <p>0:39:30.5 Peter: Next week is Navarette v. California, a case about whether the cops can pull you over because they received an anonymous tip. We're back on our cop-hating bullshit, you know what I mean? It's good.</p>
                        <p>0:39:41.6 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:39:43.2 Peter: Back to our roots. I'm excited.</p>

                        <p>0:00:01.3 [Archival]: We'll hear argument next in number 91-7328, Leonel Torres Herrera v. James A. Collins.</p>
                        <p>0:00:13.0 Leon: Hey, everyone. This is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about Herrera v. Collins, a death penalty case from 1993. In a 6 to 3 vote, the Court held that having new evidence of innocence does not entitle someone sentenced to death to habeas corpus proceedings, the last resort for capital punishment cases. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:00:49.8 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have killed off our civil liberties in the service of a misguided intellectual experiment, like Edison killed Topsy the elephant.</p>
                        <p>0:01:04.0 Rhiannon: Wow.</p>
                        <p>0:01:04.0 Peter: Are you guys familiar with the Topsy story?</p>
                        <p>0:01:06.1 Michael: I am. From Bob's Burgers. I know it from Bob's Burgers.</p>
                        <p>0:01:09.3 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:01:09.9 Rhiannon: Did he electrocute an elephant or something?</p>
                        <p>0:01:12.0 Peter: Yeah, Edison wanted to prove that electricity was powerful, and so he just killed an elephant with it.</p>
                        <p>0:01:18.1 Rhiannon: God damn.</p>
                        <p>0:01:20.1 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:01:20.3 Michael: Yeah. American hero.</p>
                        <p>0:01:22.1 Peter: Thanks for the light bulbs, dude. I am Peter. I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:26.9 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:28.0 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:29.3 Rhiannon: Hi, hi, hi, hi.</p>
                        <p>0:01:30.7 Peter: And today we are talking about Herrera v. Collins. This is a case about the death penalty. And we haven't done a death penalty case yet, and we thought it would a good time to do one for a couple of reasons.</p>
                        <p>0:01:42.5 Rhiannon: The holiday season.</p>
                        <p>0:01:46.9 Peter: Well, but I think first, we're like 48 something episodes in, so maybe a little overdue.</p>
                        <p>0:01:51.2 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:01:51.9 Peter: And second, the Trump administration has, in its final months, begun what appears to be a calculated effort to expedite pending federal executions. So after two decades without a single federal execution taking place, the administration carried out three in the span of four days this summer, has carried out 11 total this year, and has more scheduled, including several immediately before Biden's inauguration.</p>
                        <p>0:02:17.2 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:02:17.8 Peter: So this has reignited some public debate, in large part because most likely the administration is doing this to make a statement about what they believe the role of the state to be in criminal justice, which is a mechanism for inflicting punishment.</p>
                        <p>0:02:33.1 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:02:33.2 Peter: I will say up top that I am opposed to the death penalty, in large part because I think the risk of executing an innocent person far outweighs whatever utility you might find in killing evil people. To me, I think you can make a moral argument that certain crimes are deserving of death. If someone brutally murders a child or founds a chapter of College Republicans, I get it. I'm not saying I agree, but I get the argument in the abstract. But this case isn't about the morality of killing someone who did something heinous. It's about the risk that you are almost always running, which is that you are maybe killing an innocent person. In this case, a man about to be executed filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in court, claiming that he had evidence of his innocence. If you don't know, habeas corpus is essentially a procedural mechanism for prisoners to claim that their imprisonment is unlawful and request that a court look into the matter. A habeas corpus is a right that stretches back to medieval times, which is why we keep using the stupid Latin name, in order to show that this is very old and fancy.</p>
                        <p>0:03:44.3 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:03:45.0 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:03:45.5 Peter: So Rhi, give us the background here.</p>
                        <p>0:03:48.3 Rhiannon: Sure. So just to note, this kind of feels like hearkening back to some older episodes. We're back in cases that start with some gruesome facts. So it's a murder case, right, so it's a tough story. In September 1981, a passerby happened upon the dead body of police officer David Rucker, on a highway in South Texas. This happened like just north of Brownsville. At about the same time that the passerby comes upon this dead body, another officer, officer Enrique Carrisalez pulled over a speeding car travelling away from the scene where Rucker's body had been found. The driver of the speeding car fired at officer Carrisalez and nine days later, Carrisalez died of those wounds.</p>
                        <p>0:04:38.3 Rhiannon: And Carrisalez had had a passenger with him, an officer partner in his police car, though, and that passenger as well as Carrisalez, before he died, identified a man named Leonel Herrera as the shooter. So the investigation found other evidence that it linked Herrera to the murder as well. A license plate check on the car that was pulled over revealed that Herrera's girlfriend owned the car and he was found with the keys in his possession. Splatters of blood on the car and on Herrera's jeans matched officer Rucker's blood type, but not Herrera's.</p>
                        <p>0:05:14.7 Peter: This is before you could do the full DNA, so they were just like, "Yeah, it's Type A, we got the guy."</p>
                        <p>0:05:20.0 Rhiannon: Right, right, yeah. Herrera's Social Security card was discovered next to officer Rucker, the first victim's car.</p>
                        <p>0:05:28.2 Michael: Well, that one's pretty damning. Not gonna lie.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:05:30.4 Rhiannon: And...</p>
                        <p>0:05:30.9 Peter: Criminal mastermind, dude.</p>
                        <p>0:05:34.3 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:05:34.6 Peter: Did he leave a signed confession at the scene too? Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>0:05:38.6 Rhiannon: Oh, well, Herrera was carrying on him, at the time of his arrest, a letter that sort of... It implicitly referred to knowledge of the deaths of the two officers.</p>
                        <p>0:05:48.8 Peter: Dude, who even has their Social Security card on them? Let alone in a precarious position where it might fly out of your pocket.</p>
                        <p>0:05:56.5 Michael: The note is so ridiculous. It's like accusing the cops of being involved in a drug smuggling ring with them. It's pretty good, though.</p>
                        <p>0:06:04.6 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:06:05.3 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:06:05.6 Rhiannon: Yeah. You know, common conceptions of how sort of extreme interpersonal violence happens and murders and stuff is that... I don't know, people plan it and try to do a good job at it. But as somebody who defends convicted murderers sometimes, that's just not how it happens.</p>
                        <p>0:06:26.5 Michael: I'm convinced I could get away with a murder. I read this cases and I'm like, "I know all the pitfalls to avoid. I will not bring my Social Security card."</p>
                        <p>0:06:35.2 Peter: Yeah, if, you know, you're the type of guy who might kill two cops one night, then just leave the Social Security card at home.</p>
                        <p>0:06:42.8 Michael: Even if you take his confession card in his pocket at face value, it's like, "Dude, you're in a drug smuggling ring that involved several cops and you're carrying around your Social Security card?"</p>
                        <p>0:06:53.5 Peter: Right. "Here's a letter explaining the drug smuggling ring that I'm in."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:07:00.5 Rhiannon: Oh, man, I wish you guys could spend five minutes with people accused of crime.</p>
                        <p>0:07:08.3 Michael: Well, I have...</p>
                        <p>0:07:08.9 Rhiannon: Just talk to them about how they ended up where they are...</p>
                        <p>0:07:11.7 Michael: Mine were always people with MBAs, though. Unfortunately. A more polished version.</p>
                        <p>0:07:18.5 Rhiannon: Right. So, Herrera went to trial and he is convicted of capital murder. A jury sentenced him to death. So began a long appeals process in which, starting in 1990, so just about a decade after the trial and everything, Herrera began to assert that he was actually innocent and he had not murdered the officers. And in support of his innocence claim, Herrera submitted to the courts four affidavits that pointed to the guilt of Raul Herrera, who was Leonel Herrera's deceased brother.</p>
                        <p>0:07:55.8 Peter: Wait, wait, how did his brother die?</p>
                        <p>0:08:00.6 Rhiannon: His brother had been murdered in 1984, a few years after the facts of this case happened. So I'm not gonna get into the claims within the affidavits, the specifics of the affidavits, but it's important to say, I think, that these four pieces of evidence were all collected after Herrera's trial. And they call into question the reliability of his conviction. One affidavit is written by a former state judge in Texas. So there are questions about whether this conviction is real, if Leonel Herrera really did it. The important thing is that new evidence that has come up since the initial trial, since Herrera's conviction, is what needs to be reviewed here. And I think here we should explain a little bit more about the habeas process.</p>
                        <p>0:08:47.5 Rhiannon: So habeas corpus is a parallel pathway to your direct appeals process. And the process is for asserting that your constitutional rights were violated at trial. If you're allowed to have your claims reviewed in habeas proceedings, this is a separate track from your direct appeals process, in order to get a new pair of eyes to make sure that your trial was constitutionally fair. If there was a constitutional defect at your trial, like for example, you weren't given access to your attorney, or the prosecutor didn't turn over exculpatory evidence, you can be granted a new trial in habeas review. And habeas is also special, because in some ways, it's the only pathway to get your claims in front of any court.</p>
                        <p>0:09:34.2 Rhiannon: Some states have their own habeas procedures, but federal habeas is the last hope, kind of the last resort for constitutional claims after other appeals processes under state and federal law are exhausted, or if you're past those appeals deadlines. And so, Herrera submits all of this documentary evidence of his innocence in federal court, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied his claims. And basically they said he had not presented claims for which there was federal relief that could be granted.</p>
                        <p>0:10:06.4 Peter: Right, so they wouldn't even review the evidence?</p>
                        <p>0:10:08.6 Rhiannon: Right, right. They just tossed it out saying, "We can't help you, this isn't a legal claim that we can even review." So Herrera then appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, and that's how we get this...</p>
                        <p>0:10:21.7 Peter: Case.</p>
                        <p>0:10:22.1 Rhiannon: Dog shit opinion.</p>
                        <p>0:10:24.7 Peter: Oh.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:10:25.7 Peter: Yeah, so to be clear, what Herrera is asking for is just that the evidence be heard. And he is asking that that be done through habeas corpus, the right of habeas corpus. And when it is denied, what he brings to the Supreme Court is a constitutional claim. What he says is, "Look, the Eighth Amendment forbids cruel and unusual punishment." And what exactly that means has been the subject of much debate between liberals and conservatives, both because it's a very vague term, and also because most of conservatism is just sort of creating fictional enemies and then fantasizing about punishing them. And so, Herrera is saying, "Look, executing me would be cruel unusual punishment, because I am innocent."</p>
                        <p>0:11:06.1 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:11:06.4 Michael: Makes sense.</p>
                        <p>0:11:07.0 Peter: And you should review this evidence and determine whether or not that is the case." And the court, in a 6-3 decision says, "No, no, I think we're good here.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:11:20.5 Rhiannon: Right. We're not gonna look at this shit.</p>
                        <p>0:11:21.5 Michael: No, thank you.</p>
                        <p>0:11:22.9 Peter: I should note up top, there's also a Fourteenth Amendment claim here, a substantive due process under the 14th Amendment claim, basically saying that his fundamental right to have his evidence heard is being violated. We think it's sort of substantively the same as the Eighth Amendment claim, so we're gonna mostly ignore it, but just... Again, it's just so some nerd doesn't yell at us about not covering every aspect of this case. So, Chief Justice William Rehnquist takes off his Klan hood and pops on his executioner's hood to write the majority opinion here. His opinion does not actually address the question of whether executing an innocent person would violate the Eighth Amendment. Instead he sort of turns this into a procedural issue.</p>
                        <p>0:12:01.2 Peter: He says like, well, look, you already had a trial here, and that trial determined that you were guilty. So you can't use a habeas corpus petition to claim that you're innocent after a trial occurs, because that would essentially require a court to look at this again, and that's just too much, we don't need to do it. Put in the best light, taking the conservatives... Assuming they're acting in good faith here. The idea is that all of these procedural protections under the Constitution, like the due process protections, are meant to protect innocent people. But you can't just claim, according to them, "Well, I'm innocent, and that's a constitutional issue." What they're saying is, "If you had a fair trial and that determined you were guilty, then you're not innocent. Because innocence or guilt is the output of that process." You have to tie your innocence claim to some procedural unfairness. That's what the conservatives are saying.</p>
                        <p>0:12:51.2 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:12:52.4 Michael: Right. Right. And so, Rehnquist has this sort of remarkable portion... A couple of paragraphs right in the middle of the opinion, where he says, look, evidence that you're innocent, it's not that it has no place in habeas, let me tell you where we care about it. And the thing is getting into a habeas court is complicated and you have to jump through a ton of hoops. And if you mess up one, maybe years ago, the court won't hear your claims. They'll say, sorry, you didn't do this weird random thing that no reasonable person should even know that they had to do, and so we can't even hear your claim. And what Rehnquist says is, look, in those cases, if you have evidence that you're actually innocent, we'll give you a pass on messing up this nuts and bolts process. But once you get into habeas court, we still don't care whether or not you have evidence that you're actually innocent, that's still not what the court's looking at and it's not what it's concerned with. It's still concerned with whether your trial met the constitutional bare minimum of fairness.</p>
                        <p>0:13:52.1 Michael: And so, think about what this is saying. This is saying, we don't actually care if you're actually innocent. All we care about is whether you got proper process. If your trial was fair. If you have a claim that your trial was unfair, we'll hear that. But actual innocence is only important in so far as it let's us decide whether your trial was fair. It's elevating process over substance.</p>
                        <p>0:14:23.9 Peter: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:14:24.4 Michael: And saying, what's important is the fairness of your trial and not the accuracy of the outcome.</p>
                        <p>0:14:30.6 Peter: Yeah. It's like they're treating innocence as if it's not a real thing, but just the sort of determination of this system.</p>
                        <p>0:14:38.2 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:14:38.9 Peter: It's just completely bizarre.</p>
                        <p>0:14:40.4 Rhiannon: Right, and the obvious gaps that this is creating and who can sort of avail themselves of the process of habeas corpus, is people with newly discovered evidence, evidence that's found after their trial, right? So they can't say that they have a constitutional claim about what happened at trial, because it's something new or subsequent developments that happened separate and apart from their trial and afterwards.</p>
                        <p>0:15:04.8 Peter: Yeah, so what Rehnquist is saying, I think, in short is, this guy has already had a trial, at that trial, he was found to be guilty, and after you're convicted and sentenced to death, you can't use a habeas corpus petition to claim your innocence. That is not a cognizable claim under the Constitution. So Justice Sandra Day O'Connor files a concurrence that is basically just a slightly more empathetic version of the majority opinion. We haven't really ever talked about her that much. She was the first woman on the Court, conservative, appointed by Reagan. And these types of concurrences are a staple of her jurisprudence, in my view.</p>
                        <p>0:15:45.9 Rhiannon: Absolutely, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:15:46.3 Peter: The dudes on the Court will file some deeply heartless opinion, and she'll file a concurrence saying like, "Look, I agree with every pertinent part of that opinion, but here is a slightly nicer version of it." And everyone will be like, "Wow, Sandra was so nice."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:16:03.4 Rhiannon: What if you take this awful psychotic opinion, but you just take it with a spoon full of sugar.</p>
                        <p>0:16:10.6 Peter: Yeah, so here she says like, look, if an innocent person were executed, that would violate the Constitution, but that's not what's happening here, because this guy had a fair trial and he was found guilty and that's that. And it's important to note what the Court is being asked is not to decide whether this guy is innocent or not. It's to decide whether this evidence should be looked at to figure out whether he is innocent.</p>
                        <p>0:16:31.5 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:16:31.9 Peter: The conservatives are reacting to a man on death row claiming that there's evidence of his innocence with like the exasperation of a chef reacting to a guy sending back his food for the third straight time, just like, "It's always something with this guy."</p>
                        <p>0:16:49.2 Rhiannon: Yeah, yes.</p>
                        <p>0:16:49.6 Peter: It just doesn't seem like too much to ask for a court to take a look at a fairly... I shouldn't say necessarily legitimate, but a fairly extensive claim of innocence before the State of Texas literally ends his life. Is that really too much to ask?</p>
                        <p>0:17:05.1 Rhiannon: Right. Look at it. Review it. It's obviously stupid and cruel even on their own terms on this procedural question that they choose to answer. Do we have to require courts to review new evidence, that kind of thing. By most accounts and based on the way the majority opinion was written, it actually seems like Chief Justice Rehnquist wanted to answer the constitutional question and he wanted to answer it no. Rehnquist would have liked to rule in the way that Scalia describes in his concurrence, which we'll discuss in just a little bit, to basically say that actual innocence is not a cognizable constitutional claim. And one reason the majority and concurrences kind of seem confusing on some ticky tack points, is that Rehnquist likely wrote this majority opinion saying what he wanted to say and coming to his conclusion, but he just couldn't get a five justice majority on that.</p>
                        <p>0:17:56.6 Rhiannon: Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy are sort of known as the more centrist conservative Justices, and obviously, they wouldn't join that kind of opinion. So Justice Rehnquist sort of changes, just the end of the opinion to be like, well, okay, really, this is just about the procedure stuff. And it would be terrible if someone was allowed to get a second bite of the apple just 'cause they have new evidence that tends to show their complete fucking innocence. So still, this opinion and the concurrences stand as one of the starker cases from the Supreme Court on the death penalty, because while they dodge the bigger questions for more narrow procedural ones, it's clear that what they're doing is tacitly accepting that the Constitution does not prevent an innocent person from being executed. I feel like if you told someone on the street that that was the case, they wouldn't believe you. That seems like anathema to the legal protections you're supposed to get in court.</p>
                        <p>0:18:52.2 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:18:52.5 Peter: Yeah, we always talk about the fact that rights without remedies are not really rights, and this is I think a big theme of this case. The majority is sort of dodging the question of whether there's a constitutional right to not be executed if you're innocent, but in a way they're answering it. They're holding that there is no constitutional remedy for an innocent person who has been sentenced to death. And without that remedy, the right doesn't exist.</p>
                        <p>0:19:15.3 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:19:16.0 Michael: When I read cases like this, there's a question that always is just sort of in the back of my mind, which is like, what's the point of having a criminal justice system at all? And I don't mean that rhetorically. Like literally, what social problem are we solving? A lawless society, I imagine, would be something like the mob, like a lynch mob. That's what we're trying to replace. We're trying to prevent. If you have a fair, just criminal justice system, you won't have gangs of people going around putting nooses around someone's neck because they're pissed that their store got robbed. And when I read opinions like this, that doesn't feel right. It's not compatible with this. If that were the case, then executing an innocent person would cut to the core of that. Instead, it feels like what they want to do is like formalize the mob, like legitimize the mob. Like, "Oh, it's okay if we're putting a noose around some rando's neck, as long as he had a lawyer and he got to, you know, present evidence."</p>
                        <p>0:20:23.2 Peter: Yeah, so believe it or not, the opinions in this case get worse.</p>
                        <p>0:20:28.1 Rhiannon: Boy, do they.</p>
                        <p>0:20:29.3 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:20:29.4 Peter: Justice Antonin Scalia (buy our merch: fivefourpod.com...)</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:20:35.2 Peter: Filed a concurrence here. As we just noted, the majority doesn't expressly say that executing an innocent person is not a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. So Scalia files this concurrence so that he can say that it's definitely not a violation of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>0:20:53.8 Rhiannon: Yeah. That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:20:55.5 Michael: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:20:55.6 Peter: His concurrence is brief and snarky. This is 1993, and Scalia sort as... Sort of hit his stride, in terms of his sense of intellectual superiority. It only grows from here, but this is where you really start to see it, in the early '90s, from decades of being bullied for being a big know-it-all dork has culminated in a lifetime appointment without any tangible accountability, and so he's taking it out on everyone. We all have to deal with it. Scalia says there's no reason to think that there's a constitutional right to have new evidence heard after you're convicted. Specifically, he says, there's nothing, quote,"in text, tradition or even in contemporary practice," unquote, to suggest that such a right exists. He doesn't really elaborate, but I still think it's important to talk about this, 'cause it fits squarely into a theme we've touched on several times before, which is the conservative weaponization of history to justify the wrongs of the present, and that's really what he's getting at here.</p>
                        <p>0:21:51.3 Rhiannon: Yes. Right.</p>
                        <p>0:21:52.5 Peter: Scalia's originalist interpretation of what cruel and unusual punishment means is rooted in what would have been thought to be cruel or unusual at the time of the Constitution being written. I don't want to get too into originalism as an academic pursuit, but when it first gained steam in the early '70s, it was primarily about trying to determine the original intent of the Constitution, meaning what the Founding Fathers intended, and over the ensuing decades, that sort of fell out of fashion in favor of what they call the original meaning, meaning what the public would have thought the Constitution meant at the time.</p>
                        <p>0:22:30.2 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:22:30.8 Peter: And I bring this up because in a way, the shift from intent to meaning was sort of strategic by conservatives, because, in large part, what the Founders intended was probably going to be a bit more liberal than what the public would have interpreted, and I bring it up because this is a great example, the Founding Fathers themselves had fairly nuanced views on capital punishment. It's the late 1700s and Western aristocracy have just started to think about whether killing people is bad or something...</p>
                        <p>0:23:00.8 Rhiannon: Right, right, yeah. Yeah. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:23:00.9 Peter: Cesare Beccaria, that's my attempt at the pronouncing that Italian name, wrote about punishment and specifically sort of condemned capital punishment and that... Like his work really gained favor among the Founding Fathers, so if you're trying to figure out what they intended, you might think, "Well, the Constitution might want to avoid a situation like this."</p>
                        <p>0:23:20.4 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:23:20.9 Peter: But if you're trying to figure out what the general public would have thought, you're talking about people who were living substantially closer to a time when we executed people suspected of witchcraft than they do to the present.</p>
                        <p>0:23:31.5 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>0:23:31.7 Peter: In the early colonies, petty larceny could result in execution, so to use that era's norms as a barometer for what cruel and unusual punishment means is essentially to just write the clause out of the Constitution, right, these people were psychotic. And I bring this up to point out how conservatives' embrace of history as a useful tool for guiding the present is done very selectively, and that's why we say that they're weaponizing history, right? They're not learning from it or building on it, they are selectively using it to back what they already believe.</p>
                        <p>0:24:05.5 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:24:06.6 Michael: Yeah, and there is one bit of Scalia snark that I want to talk about for a sec, which is he says that he understands the Court's reluctance to admit publicly that the Constitution would let stand any injustice, much less the execution of an innocent man, so he's literally being sarcastic about the idea that the Constitution might have something to say about killing someone you know to be innocent. And he turns around and he follows that up and he says like, "Look, if you have some real evidence, you'll probably just get a pardon."</p>
                        <p>0:24:40.8 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:24:41.4 Michael: And then the Court won't have to deal with this shit anymore. Literally he says, "It isn't probable, the evidence, which failed to produce an executive pardon, with any luck we shall avoid ever having to face this embarrassing question again." Embarrassing, whether or not the Constitution has anything to say about killing an innocent person.</p>
                        <p>0:25:00.8 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:25:00.8 Michael: That's what he thinks. Fuck that guy.</p>
                        <p>0:25:02.4 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, I think it's worth talking about, since we've mentioned that the conservative majority here is choosing to take on a formalistic procedural question rather than a big constitutional question. I think it's worth discussing a little bit what the Supreme Court could have done in this case, to have come to a better result. This one is almost so obvious that it's maybe a little bit stupid or elementary, the Court should have taken up the larger constitutional question, "Is it cruel and unusual punishment to be executed for a crime you did not commit?" And the answer is obviously, obviously, yes. That is unconstitutional.</p>
                        <p>0:25:39.7 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:40.4 Rhiannon: That is cruel and unusual. Because of course it is. What kind of depraved, fucked up, insane, authoritarian view of state power do you have to think otherwise?</p>
                        <p>0:25:51.7 Peter: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:52.5 Rhiannon: You don't have to be a fucking whizz-kid legal genius to think that in a democracy, the law shouldn't have to sometimes be cool with innocent people being murdered by the state. That's crazy. But there are lots of reasons why that didn't happen, not least of which, because of an ideologically conservative understanding of when and where a court is supposed to step in on a case, and on whose behalf.</p>
                        <p>0:26:18.2 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:26:18.7 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:26:19.2 Peter: I think it's important to note that it might have been very simple for the conservatives to say, look, it's unconstitutional to execute an innocent person, but in this case, we're not gonna give him habeas review and for all these reasons. I think the reason they didn't do that is because they don't want to create a constitutional right, that they then have to sort of afford some procedural protections to. If you say, you can't do this under the Constitution, then you have to explain what they're actually doing to prevent it from happening. And this Court doesn't want to do anything to prevent it from happening.</p>
                        <p>0:26:51.0 Michael: Right, it's very easy to see how that would play out. Even if you were sending it down to the lower courts to figure it out, there'd have to be some standard for the type of evidence that even gets you habeas review and then the persuasiveness of that evidence to actually get your petition granted. And it would be a lot of work. And man, it would suck if they would have to hear a lot of these cases.</p>
                        <p>0:27:12.3 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:27:12.8 Rhiannon: Exactly. And I think the Court sees itself here, and I'd say in the vast majority of its cases, not as reviewing a criminal case and subsequent developments in order to vindicate an individual person's rights. They aren't looking at the procedures in place for people to have their day in court, and they're not trying to formulate more expansive pathways so that even people and prisoners with few resources can have all of the information that they would like presented to a court reviewed closely and fairly before the state can fucking kill them. Here, it's very clear that the Court sees itself instead as protecting the dockets of lower courts, making sure that the pathway is as narrow as possible, because we don't want all of these cases.</p>
                        <p>0:27:58.8 Rhiannon: On the one hand, in death penal jurisprudence, the Supreme Court emphasizes that the death penalty should only be given to the worst of the worst, the most extreme or depraved or violent or hurtful kinds of capital murder. But in this case, we see how much those writings, those other opinions are just paying lip service to sort of these more just principles. Because here what they're saying is, man, if some guy who's innocent gets executed, that's just a sacrifice our system must bear. Because God damn, would it suck if people were able to use federal courts to hear these kinds of claims. Like, God, we're tired of all the complaining. And I don't think it's worth trying to get into the mind of these freaks too much, because I promise you, it'll be 100 times more terrifying and depraved than any of the minds of any quote-unquote criminal client I've represented.</p>
                        <p>0:28:50.5 Rhiannon: But this flows, I think, from a conception of what it means to be a judge, that you make courts and access to legal remedies less available to common people. This idea that it should be hard, that the burden on an individual must be impossibly high to get a court to do shit for you. That from this opinion really makes me really sick.</p>
                        <p>0:29:11.0 Michael: Yeah, and I think something that makes this case maybe even worse, is that, look, this guy... There was a lot of evidence against him, and...</p>
                        <p>0:29:21.4 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>0:29:21.8 Michael: I think you could argue that the evidence that he was innocent is kinda weak. And so... I could see a listener listening to this and being like, "Well, yeah, but look, I don't think they put an innocent man to death. I think they put a guilty guy to death." And maybe... But that's even worse. That's literally even worse because the Court is closing off pathways that maybe should be available for people with far more persuasive evidence, far more compelling evidence. In this case, sending this back, the most likely scenario is that a judge looks at this, maybe takes testimony from the former judge in person to evaluate its credibility. And otherwise it's like, "Nah," and that's it.</p>
                        <p>0:30:01.0 Peter: I think all three of us would like, put a gun to my head and say, is this guy innocent or guilty? Guilty.</p>
                        <p>0:30:05.3 Rhiannon: Don't speak for me.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:30:07.1 Peter: You think he's innocent? No, you don't.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:30:10.3 Rhiannon: I think it doesn't matter, you know.</p>
                        <p>0:30:12.0 Peter: No, it doesn't matter. But that's the point I'm making, Rhi, God.</p>
                        <p>0:30:14.6 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:30:15.2 Peter: The innocence of this guy is not what's really at issue here. The question is whether someone who produces evidence that he is innocent after his conviction, can have that heard in court. And if this guy is guilty, so be it, let a court look at the evidence.</p>
                        <p>0:30:30.4 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. And I think it should be emphasized how much this opinion is sort of a sign of the times, in terms of where our legal institutions... Where they were at in their treatment of criminality and the justice system. It wasn't that long ago, we mentioned this opinion came down in 1993, but it does feel like the product of a sort of bygone era, particularly because of the consequences this decision, and other so-called Tough on Crime approaches in the '80s and '90s, had particularly on the poor and people of color and how that's affected public understandings of how the death penalty is carried out. So just to illustrate this point a bit, this opinion comes down in 1993.</p>
                        <p>0:31:10.1 Rhiannon: The next year, 1994, the Federal Crime Bill, written by Joe Biden, becomes law, and that included the expansion of the use of the federal death penalty to more than 60 new crimes. And then in 1996, AEDPA, which is The Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, was passed.</p>
                        <p>0:31:29.7 Peter: Yeah, how'd that do on preventing terrorism, by the way... 1996...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:31:34.4 Michael: Weren't the first World Trade Center bombings in '96?</p>
                        <p>0:31:38.4 Peter: No, it was '93.</p>
                        <p>0:31:40.2 Michael: Oh, were they? Oh.</p>
                        <p>0:31:41.8 Rhiannon: '93 is Oklahoma City.</p>
                        <p>0:31:41.9 Peter: No, '95 is Oklahoma City, '93 is World Trade Center. Guys, really.</p>
                        <p>0:31:47.1 Rhiannon: AEDPA is passed after Oklahoma City.</p>
                        <p>0:31:49.6 Peter: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:31:49.7 Rhiannon: So that... Tim McVeigh can get fucking fried.</p>
                        <p>0:31:53.4 Peter: That was back when they called that terrorism.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:31:55.4 Michael: And not MAGA.</p>
                        <p>0:32:00.1 Peter: Right. Oh yeah, the official position of Ted Cruz is that Timothy McVeigh was a freedom fighter.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:32:06.7 Rhiannon: So you see that institutionally in the US, at this time, there was a sort of blood-thirstiness for use of the death penalty. And often this urge for state-sponsored violence was couched in language about making capital sentencing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, more efficient.</p>
                        <p>0:32:23.8 Michael: Effective Death Penalty Act.</p>
                        <p>0:32:25.6 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:32:26.0 Michael: We want an effective death penalty.</p>
                        <p>0:32:28.1 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:32:29.4 Michael: God.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:32:32.8 Rhiannon: From the late '80s to the late '90s, the incidence of people being sentenced to death in the US peaked, as did the number of executions carried out. So in 1994, 1995 and 1996, there were more than 300 people sentenced to death each of those years in the United States, and this is happening at the same time that Governors, state legislators, Congress and Judges are talking about death penalty appeals taking too long, that we need to reduce the amount of time between when a person is convicted of a capital crime and when they're executed.</p>
                        <p>0:33:05.8 Michael: Look, you can't really sate the mob if you make them wait 10 years to see their public hanging.</p>
                        <p>0:33:11.4 Peter: That really is it, right?</p>
                        <p>0:33:12.7 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:33:13.6 Peter: That really is it.</p>
                        <p>0:33:13.7 Rhiannon: No, that is it.</p>
                        <p>0:33:14.4 Peter: It's satiating the sort of public blood thirst, and it's so deeply intertwined with the conservative conception of what to do about crime, which is just...</p>
                        <p>0:33:24.2 Rhiannon: Which is genocide.</p>
                        <p>0:33:24.9 Peter: Well, sure, but you divide society into good guys and bad guys and just act accordingly. And it's like, "We already found out they're a bad guy. What else is there to discuss?" That's really their perspective.</p>
                        <p>0:33:35.1 Rhiannon: Right, right. All that said, with today's understandings of how all of these laws actually played out, it's hard to imagine this opinion being written in 2020, this level of callousness. In 1993, the idea that innocent people were routinely being caught up in the criminal justice system, much less that they were being executed, had not really proliferated across public discourse. At this time, there were not innocence projects across the country bringing a light to these cases, and there just wasn't like a comprehensive body of information about wrongful convictions. The Death Penalty Information Center, it's a really big non-profit organization that does a lot of reporting and dissemination of studies about how the death penalty is carried out in the US, they were only founded in 1990.</p>
                        <p>0:34:22.1 Rhiannon: And they say that since 1973, there have been 172 people exonerated from death row in the United States, and the vast majority of those have been after 1990 and after this case. The Justices, when they're writing Herrera, they just don't have in the front of their minds these stories of innocent people being executed. They just don't think it's a big problem.</p>
                        <p>0:34:47.9 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:34:48.4 Peter: A huge aspect of this is advances in technology, especially in DNA, where all of a sudden we have something that is as close to proof as the criminal justice system will ever really see, and you have these cases where you can definitively say, "Why, that guy didn't do it. He wasn't the rapist. He wasn't the murderer." And the idea that we were getting some sizable chunk of these wrong was suddenly introduced into the public consciousness with strong evidence.</p>
                        <p>0:35:15.8 Michael: Right. We said that there hadn't been federal executions in two decades and that spans Bush's tenure.</p>
                        <p>0:35:22.1 Rhiannon: Right, yes.</p>
                        <p>0:35:23.0 Michael: Just a few years later, you had a conservative president and they were not putting people to death.</p>
                        <p>0:35:28.9 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:35:29.2 Michael: It's not a big stretch to think that this was just like a few years too early.</p>
                        <p>0:35:33.9 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly, and we should say that developments in forensic science, DNA, technological innovations, all of that has prompted some states to change their appeals and habeas proceedings slightly, which is why you might hear of people on death row being exonerated. We said up top that there are state habeas proceedings in some states and federal habeas proceedings as well, and we should be clear that this decision still stands, it's still law. So at the federal level, you are not entitled to habeas relief based only on an innocence claim. We should keep in mind that states don't always do a great job at reviewing cases in state court, in part, because they have a history of doing a shit job at all of this, like being racist, of being discriminatory, of carrying out executions in arbitrary and capricious ways.</p>
                        <p>0:36:27.2 Rhiannon: And the other thing, of course, is that you have federal prosecutions, like the ones we mentioned up top. Those cases don't start in state court. And because of this decision in Herrera, people with stand-alone innocence claims are not entitled to federal habeas review even if you have something like newly discovered DNA. This case is still identified as being one of the worst cases in Supreme Court jurisprudence on the death penalty by academics who study the Eighth Amendment and capital defense practitioners.</p>
                        <p>0:37:00.6 Rhiannon: The broad lesson for me is that the Supreme Court is sort of always behind the times. It's not gonna be out front on these issues even though they could be equipped to do so, and even though I think in public conceptions of what the Supreme Court does or is supposed to do, I think most people would think like, "Yeah, that's what the Supreme Court does, is step in on exactly this kind of issue. Is hear somebody's plea who's saying I'm scheduled for execution and I'm actually innocent and I have evidence." And I just think this case is a reminder that they are going to be behind public trends, not in front of them, and certainly not starting them. And in many ways, the institution sort of holds us back from social progress.</p>
                        <p>0:37:47.2 Peter: Yes, and I want to point out something that goes hand-in-hand with that, which is, yes, they are sort of behind the times in many ways, that doesn't impact their confidence. That didn't impact the way that Scalia wrote about this case as if it was open and shut. This is an institution that has in this case, no fucking idea what it's talking about. No concept of what the risk that they're running when they deny this man a hearing on his evidence of innocence actually is, and yet they speak as if they do. And just take a step back and picture the various ways in which the current court speaks with confidence, when they have no real vision into what's actually happening in criminal justice, in employment, across a hundred different possible topics. These are people who need to demonstrate some amount of humility, humble themselves a little before their responsibility, and you just do not see that in what they do, and that's why they fucking suck, that's why they suck.</p>
                        <p>0:38:48.7 Michael: Yeah, yeah. I was chatting with somebody the other day, and I made the point that I was like, "Look, as long as your brain isn't like totally rotten from cable news, especially, but not limited to Fox News, and you have an ounce of compassion, your politics are probably fine." Maybe not great, maybe you're not like fucking Martin Luther King or whatever, but they're probably fine. Cable news wasn't really nearly what it is now in 1993, and their politics was still awful, and you just have to think like how little empathy and compassion and concern for their fellow man, these people had... They are fucking demons.</p>
                        <p>0:39:30.4 Peter: Yeah, it's this ideological poison. They have this concept in their mind that they stick with very firmly, which is that the Constitution doesn't necessarily do anything, and we're not making these sort of moral judgment calls, and so that is how we create emotional and moral distance from our rulings. We can say, look, sure, the Constitution doesn't prevent this from happening, that's so unfortunate. You know, we totally wish it did, but it just doesn't, and you libs need to accept that. That's the sort of consequence of what is in the early '90s, 20 or so years of conservative ideology in the law being ascendant.</p>
                        <p>0:40:15.1 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I just want to get back to the Trump executions that we mentioned at the beginning, so the latest three people who have been executed by the federal government, I think it's worth just saying their names and talking a little bit about what happened at their trials, because in this case, Rehnquist and O'Connor and Scalia are so focused on the fairness of the trial proceedings, and I think it's worth highlighting what happens in this area of the law that the conservative justices have convinced themselves is sufficient and fair and constitutionally permissible.</p>
                        <p>0:40:55.6 Rhiannon: Orlando Hall was executed on November 19th of this year. Mr. Hall was a black man, he was convicted by an all-white jury, and his attorneys argued until his execution that the prosecutor in his case had engaged in racially discriminatory behavior throughout the entirety of Mr. Hall's trial. Brandon Bernard, you might have heard about, he was executed on December 10th, just a couple of days ago from this recording. He was executed for the shooting deaths of two people, but Brandon was not the gunman. We've talked in a previous episode about felony murder rules where somebody who actually did not kill anybody can be executed for somebody's murder, and in fact, in Mr. Bernard's case, newly revealed evidence showed that prosecutors withheld important information at Mr. Bernard's trial, showing that he had an even less important role than jurors were led to believe at the time they convicted him and sentenced him to death.</p>
                        <p>0:41:55.2 Rhiannon: With that new information, five of the nine jurors who convicted Mr. Bernard said that if they had been aware of the new information which was undisclosed to the public, they would not have sentenced Brendon Bernard to death. And in the case of Alfred Bourgeois, he was executed on December 11th, just a day after Mr. Bernard, he was executed despite the fact that he was intellectually disabled, he had an IQ between 70 and 75, there is a fairly long standing constitutional rule that we cannot execute a person who is intellectually disabled, and that execution was carried out you know, Peter, you said up top that you think that there is probably a moral argument for somebody who commits a specifically or egregiously heinous act of murder, and that may be morally being deserving of the death penalty. I think what's important, and that would I see sort of in my work and talking and thinking about these issues all the time, is that I probably agree with you, I probably think like there is a CEO who has wrought violence and harm on enough people that maybe morally is deserving of getting offed, but.</p>
                        <p>0:43:25.8 Michael: Robespierre over here has some thoughts about what crimes are and are not capital.</p>
                        <p>0:43:31.9 Peter: Alright, let's restate so that you don't have to say getting offed.</p>
                        <p>0:43:35.6 Rhiannon: That are deserving of execution, of the death penalty. But I think that in carrying out the death penalty in a modern society, the instances of where it actually happens, for which crimes, who gets prosecuted for it, the sort of just meta-moral argument is so abstracted from the reality of how human beings in a society like are meting out punishment.</p>
                        <p>0:44:02.3 Peter: And that is how I meant. I see the moral argument, I don't necessarily agree with it, but to the extent I do agree with it, it's completely in the abstract and sort of manifestation of that abstract concept into the death penalty as we know it, is completely distant from the moral argument. It has almost no relation, it's the manifestation of public blood thirst, state violence, and the systemic oppression of massive populations of people...</p>
                        <p>0:44:29.4 Michael: I don't know that I buy the moral argument, even in the abstract, we give the state the monopoly on violence, that's part of the social compact, we get to decide the limits of that violence. I think there's an argument for just saying, look, you don't get to kill people. That's it. And it doesn't matter the crime, that's something that we've decided we don't want to give the state for small l libertarian reasons about autocracy, oppression, injustice, all that, and just like... I think what I'm saying is that I just don't even think the death penalty discussion is even asking the right questions all the time.</p>
                        <p>0:45:09.7 Michael: Are there crimes heinous enough to deserve death? That's not the right question to me, I think you guys agree. But also, is there an intolerable risk of getting it wrong and killing an innocent person? I don't think that's the right question either. Maybe they're good for persuading people, but in terms of what's right and wrong, it's sort of first principle questions. What type of society do we want to live in? What do we collectively value? How should those values be reflected in the government we build for ourselves? And I want to live in a society that's compassionate, it's merciful, it values life. And I don't see a place for the death penalty in that at all.</p>
                        <p>0:45:49.8 Rhiannon: Yeah, something that is sort of really persuasive to me is the idea that because we live in a society that allows the state to murder people legally, then what sort of violence do we accept from the state after that? If they're allowed to kill somebody, then it sort of just logically flows that we accept a lot of state violence.</p>
                        <p>0:46:16.1 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:46:16.2 Rhiannon: Just from that premise.</p>
                        <p>0:46:16.1 Peter: Right. I think there's an idea that is common among reactionaries, that part of the state's role, and maybe even one of the largest parts of the state's role, is to punish malfeasance and to act as the manifestation of the anger of society broadly, towards people who deviate in their minds. And of course, what reactionaries view as deviation always aligns with their views of social hierarchies, etcetera, and that's why these systems act to facilitate and continue these oppressive structures.</p>
                        <p>0:46:52.6 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:46:53.8 Michael: Yeah, and there's sort of academic or legal argument for things like the death penalty and retributive justice that, like it discourages private violence. I am not convinced that it's not the opposite, that it creates a culture in an idea that death is an appropriate punishment. And so we forgive when people mete it out privately. Like when a fight breaks out or whatever, and one guy gets killed, well, that's just what happens. And this ends up often being that when white people kill black people, we're like, "Well, what was he up to?" This is the output, a culture where Trayvon Martin can be murdered, where Eric Garner can be murdered and people think that's fine, because death is an appropriate punishment for selling loose cigarettes.</p>
                        <p>0:47:46.5 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:47:47.4 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:47:48.9 Peter: An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:47:52.2 Rhiannon: Gandhi told you already.</p>
                        <p>0:47:55.3 Peter: So, we are gonna take the holiday season off, there are gonna be some announcements, the first of which we can actually make. We will be guesting on a podcast very soon called Know Your Enemy, which I think will probably pop into our feeds so our listeners can check it out. And we will have some very big announcements in the new year. You may have noticed, we don't currently have ads. We have cast off our corporate shackles and are looking for newer better shackles to place on ourselves. So, hopefully some cool announcements in the new year.</p>
                        <p>0:48:35.2 Rhiannon: Peter, what'd you get me for Christmas?</p>
                        <p>0:48:37.6 Peter: I was just gonna Venmo you 10 bucks.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:48:44.4 Michael: I actually do have a Christmas present for you guys.</p>
                        <p>0:48:46.2 Rhiannon: Shut up.</p>
                        <p>0:48:47.0 Michael: It's the friendship bracelets I promised you 10 months ago...</p>
                        <p>0:48:50.2 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah!</p>
                        <p>0:48:50.8 Michael: And never sent.</p>
                        <p>0:48:51.2 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:48:52.5 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:48:53.1 Peter: Hell, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:48:53.2 Michael: They're coming.</p>

                        <p>0:00:03.6 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about a very recent case in which the Supreme Court blocked New York Governor Andrew Cuomo from restricting the size of religious gatherings because of COVID-19.</p>
                        <p>0:00:20.6 [Archival]: This was a 5-4 decision, it was an injunction that was issued late last night.</p>
                        <p>0:00:25.5 [Archival]: The majority said houses of worship had been singled out for tougher treatment, while the dissenters said that government needs leeway when it comes to public health in a pandemic.</p>
                        <p>0:00:34.7 Leon: The decision has already spawned new complaints about pandemic-related restrictions nationwide and it likely foreshadows the expansion of legal exemptions for religious groups.</p>
                        <p>0:00:43.7 [Archival: Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the newest Justice, voted to block the restriction along with Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.</p>
                        <p>0:00:52.1 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:01:01.3 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have coalesced like that garbage island in the Pacific Ocean, together a monument to the sheer scale of man's folly. I am Peter, I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:21.2 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>0:01:21.3 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:22.3 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:23.8 Peter: Today's case is Roman Catholic diocese of Brooklyn v. Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of New York.</p>
                        <p>0:01:31.3 Rhiannon: Ooh, who do we like more?</p>
                        <p>0:01:34.0 Peter: This is a fresh one. The opinion dropped the night before this past Thanksgiving, the Court held in a 5-4 decision, where John Roberts joined the liberals in dissent, that New York's restrictions on certain large religious gatherings were unconstitutional under the First Amendment because they violate the right to the free exercise of religion. This case is a big deal for a few reasons. Most immediately, it signals a shift on these COVID-related court cases. Before RBG's death, the liberals were upholding most of these COVID restrictions, with John Roberts joining their side. With RBG being replaced by our wide-eyed buddy Amy Coney Barrett, these cases are now going in the other direction.</p>
                        <p>0:02:17.5 Peter: More holistically, this case is the first of what are likely to be many more in which the conservatives on the Court hold a very expansive view of what constitutes protected religious activity under the First Amendment. We are in a new era of unfettered special treatment for religious institutions, and this case seems like a good indicator of just how emboldened the conservatives feel about their hold over the law.</p>
                        <p>0:02:43.7 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:02:45.0 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:02:45.9 Peter: It's also a good reference point for how high the brain rot among conservatives goes. I think a lot of people view the most aggressively anti-science positions of the electorate, like COVID denialism and so forth, as like the province of the less educated GOP base. But here you have the conservatives on the Supreme Court, supposedly the tippy top of the conservative intellectual brain trust, essentially replacing the perspectives of medical experts with their own.</p>
                        <p>0:03:17.0 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:03:18.2 Peter: As we've noted before, the degree of separation between right-wing talk radio and the like, and the ostensibly foremost minds of American conservatism is much, much smaller than you might think. Since the pandemic started, you've probably seen hundreds of viral videos where some lunatic in a grocery store is spouting off about the tyranny of COVID restrictions. Just imagine that that lunatic was associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, that he was marginally more eloquent, and you're beginning to understand this case.</p>
                        <p>0:03:54.0 Rhiannon: That's right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:03:54.9 Michael: That's right. Before we get started, I just want to note, like Peter said, this is our sort of first post-Ginsburg 5-4 decision. And so I do think it's worth taking a minute to contemplate that. I don't want to trash a dead woman who was justifiably an icon to so many people, and I don't want to rehash everything from our episode about her, but I do think as you listen to this case it's probably good to remind yourself that her hubris is part of what brought us here, and the result is going to be that a lot of people probably needlessly die. That's like a very predictable outcome of this case. Luckily, it seems like vaccines are on the way, and so that might dull the impact, but the broader point is that there are real consequences to the decisions people in power make, and this is a particularly poignant and visceral reminder of that.</p>
                        <p>0:04:53.1 Rhiannon: Yeah. Michael, I'm not letting it slide, your little flex on Amy Coney Barrett just now, that you pronounced poignant correctly. Congratulations.</p>
                        <p>0:05:00.5 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:05:04.0 Rhiannon: So I can lay down some background for us today. Just to ground us in a bit of reality before we talk about what Andrew Cuomo and the State of New York were trying to do in this case and what got shut down. We all know that we are living through or trying to live through a pandemic right now, and that in the United States, the federal government has been more or less utterly ineffective at keeping us safe, and that it's been left to individual states and their respective public health officials by and large to figure out what to do and how to manage this crisis.</p>
                        <p>0:05:40.0 Michael: Yeah. I was going to say, this is the first moment where I really get why the Articles of the Confederation did not last. If we had six more years of this where it'd be... We're starting over from scratch. This just doesn't work. You need a strong federal government...</p>
                        <p>0:05:58.2 Rhiannon: Yes, excellent point. So this fucking virus... The first thing we know about this virus is that it's deadly, it's alarmingly so. And then the second thing we know is how it's passed around, like how people transmit and contract the virus. It's passed person to person, typically through the transfer of respiratory droplets, obviously from coughing or sneezing or talking, and this transmission happens quickest indoors in enclosed spaces. A recent Stanford study, in fact, found that on average across metro areas in the US, restaurants, gyms, hotels, cafes and religious organizations produced the largest predicted increases in infections when those places were re-opened and people were allowed to congregate again in those spaces.</p>
                        <p>0:06:46.1 Peter: And kissing booths.</p>
                        <p>0:06:50.5 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:06:50.6 Peter: Please God.</p>
                        <p>0:06:54.9 Rhiannon: And of course, we are now experiencing a surge in COVID numbers that scientists and public health officials predicted would happen as the result of colder winter months, students going back to school, all of it. So in response to all of this, New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, for his part, has issued dozens of executive orders since the initial outbreak of COVID 19 in March, but the one at issue in this case was a specific order issued just in October. This measure was prompted by surging cases in certain neighborhoods of New York City.</p>
                        <p>0:07:27.9 Michael: Right. Some of them included Orthodox, like Hasidic Jewish neighborhoods.</p>
                        <p>0:07:33.3 Rhiannon: And what it did was allow the Governor to designate specific areas as red zones, orange zones and yellow zones. So in a red zone were areas where concentrations of COVID cases were highest, and in those zones, the Executive Order capped attendance at religious services at 10 people; in an orange zone, the maximum capacity allowed in houses of worship was 25 people. So importantly, though, businesses that were deemed essential were not ordered to have the same capacity limits, so like for example, a hardware store in a red zone didn't have the maximum 10-person occupancy, but large indoor gatherings, importantly, like concert venues, those are completely shut down, whereas religious gatherings are allowed, but at these kind of limited numbers, depending on what zone they are in.</p>
                        <p>0:08:24.0 Rhiannon: So this made some of our more pious neighbors angry and two religious organizations, the Roman Catholic diocese of Brooklyn, as well as Agudath Israel of America, applied for an injunction so that the capacity limits from Cuomo's Executive Order would not be enforced against them, and they could meet in larger groups in their churches and synagogues respectively. So this case makes it to the Supreme Court on the shadow docket, we've mentioned before, but the shadow docket refers to the body of legal orders that are issued by the Supreme Court outside of the cases for which the Court hears oral argument and issues its formal written opinions.</p>
                        <p>0:09:07.2 Rhiannon: The shadow docket orders, usually they can be peripheral or purely procedural, kind of technical legal matters, so if a party is asking for additional time on a case, it would be on the shadow docket and the Supreme Court should just quickly issue an order, but some orders from the shadow docket decide kind of contentious and urgent matters. The important thing here, I think, is that usually orders from the shadow docket are issued without additional written justification from the Justices. Here, though, we did get written opinions.</p>
                        <p>0:09:43.5 Michael: A lot of them.</p>
                        <p>0:09:46.5 Rhiannon: Yeah, and that's significant because it could be that the Justices have heard like recent criticism about orders coming down from the shadow docket without written reasoning, and because the Justices are all kind of signaling what might be done on future cases that look like this, particularly with regard to freedom of religion and free exercise cases.</p>
                        <p>0:10:06.6 Peter: So the legal question is whether these restrictions violate the First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. And the main thing to remember here is that if something only coincidentally limits the exercise of religion, that is generally not considered a violation of the First Amendment. So if the government says no crowds of 10 or more anywhere, that's pretty much never going to be a violation of the free exercise clause because it impacts everyone equally. The only question here is whether this order is sort of unfairly targeting religious institutions or religious people without adequate justification, and the Court, of course, says that it is.</p>
                        <p>0:10:45.9 Peter: One notable thing here, this is a per curiam decision, which we have talked about before, but essentially means that no single Justice put their name on the majority opinion; instead, it is sort of symbolically presented as if it is the opinion of the Court itself. Naturally, that symbolism is in and of itself meaningless bullshit, but it's important because it's a signal that the conservatives believe that they are making a statement here. It's a presentation of a unified front, and it's also important because it means we don't really know who wrote the majority. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh both filed separate concurrences, and I think if you look at the writing style, there's enough there to say that it was probably Amy Coney Barrett herself.</p>
                        <p>0:11:30.0 Michael: I think so too. It doesn't feel like an Alito opinion.</p>
                        <p>0:11:33.8 Peter: No, it doesn't. It has some of the indicators of her writing style, but again, we're just guessing. So on to the case itself. The central argument of the majority opinion is very simple, the order in New York limits attendance in religious houses of worship to, for example, 10 people in designated red zones, but it does not apply attendance limits to other businesses in the same zones, so if you're a hardware store in that red zone, you could technically have more than 10 people in the store. And the Court says that that is essentially singling out religious institutions in an unconstitutional fashion. I don't think you need to be a legal genius to see the counterpoint to this, which is that religious services are not really comparable to other businesses, people sit down generally in groups, generally for long periods of time, often singing and chanting and shit, that is uniquely high risk.</p>
                        <p>0:12:30.9 Michael: Speaking in tongues, if you're at one of Coney Barrett's.</p>
                        <p>0:12:34.4 Peter: Who knows what these people do. And the state order entirely prohibits similarly large indoor gatherings like concerts. Like Rhi said, religious services actually get favorable treatment under the law compared to those secular gatherings. Gorsuch files a concurrence here where he is extremely sanctimonious about this point.</p>
                        <p>0:13:01.4 Rhiannon: Gosh.</p>
                        <p>0:13:01.5 Peter: He points out that there are no capacity restrictions on hardware stores or liquor stores or bike shops, so he says, "According to the Governor, it may be unsafe to go to church, but it is always fine to pick up another bottle of wine or shop for a new bike," the paragraph ends with "who knew public health would so perfectly align with secular convenience." That is obviously a complete dodge of the fact that none of those businesses operate anything at all like a church or synagogue.</p>
                        <p>0:13:30.6 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:13:31.3 Peter: No one hangs out in those stores for two hours conversing and belting out hymns and shit. I am a man in my 30s, I drink alcohol, big fan. When I tell you that never in my life has someone tried to talk to me in a liquor store, I am not exaggerating.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:13:48.9 Michael: Absolutely not.</p>
                        <p>0:13:50.1 Peter: If someone who was not an employee approached me in a liquor store, I'm immediately fight or flight. Just high alert right away.</p>
                        <p>0:13:58.3 Rhiannon: This is unnatural.</p>
                        <p>0:14:00.4 Peter: They are not comparable situations. Comparable situations would be public speaking events or concerts, and those are banned.</p>
                        <p>0:14:07.4 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:14:07.9 Peter: So what's the fucking complaint here? I think that Gorsuch just wanted to use this opportunity to make one of those sorts of decay of society points that conservatives always bust out, like, "Oh, you can't go to church, but you can buy a beer. You can't pray in schools anymore, but the substitute teacher will put on Love Actually and you have to watch that." It's just like fodder for small minds.</p>
                        <p>0:14:33.2 Michael: Exactly. It's like Fox News brain. It's playing on the caricature that like a lot of suburban and rural residents have of cities, the same people who would tell you on Twitter or Facebook that New York City's a hell hole during the BLM protests. And you'd be like, "It's not. I'm here. I'm walking in the bodega and nobody's assaulting me." They'd be like, "No. I know for a fact, it's basically a war zone." Those are the people that this is written for. It's like, "Look, they're fucking drinking MD 2020 and not going to church, 'cause they're secular heathens." That's what this opinion is.</p>
                        <p>0:15:18.8 Peter: Absolutely. And so all through one per curiam opinion and two concurrences, the conservatives do not once try to address the fact that religious services involve people sitting, speaking, singing in a closed space for prolonged periods of time, where none of the businesses they call comparable share that feature. And that's sort of the bottom line here, the entire position of the conservatives rests on the idea that religious services are comparable to these other types of businesses, from grocery stores to department stores. And if you accept that those are fundamentally not comparable for purposes of analyzing COVID risk, you have to reject the Court's argument. I think it's as simple as that.</p>
                        <p>0:15:57.4 Rhiannon: Exactly. Yeah. A really important piece of this, I think, is that New York's restrictions are policy decisions made with significant input from experts, and those experts continue to back the restrictions. The district court in this case did extensive fact-finding to establish that the restrictions were backed by medical expertise. The American Medical Association filed a brief that was in support of New York's position, and up against that is basically five dipshits on the Supreme Court, just sort of eye-balling whether they think these restrictions make sense or not. And sorry, that's not the same as what the doctors and scientists are saying.</p>
                        <p>0:16:35.6 Michael: Right. Right. It's like the old Onion article, right? I think war on Iraq will unleash chaos in the Middle East first. No, it won't. [laughter] That's this opinion in a nutshell.</p>
                        <p>0:16:49.0 Peter: So the legal analysis does not end there. The Court has determined that religious institutions are being treated differently, and now they have to evaluate whether that is justified. And they do that by applying a strict scrutiny analysis, meaning they determine whether the restrictions are narrowly tailored to fulfilling a compelling state interest. If that doesn't sound like it actually means anything, congratulations, you are basically a lawyer now.</p>
                        <p>0:17:18.1 Rhiannon: The Court points out that there's no evidence that the churches or synagogues in question have contributed to the spread of COVID. I'm like, "Do you get how fucking viruses work?" Large crowds gathering in close proximity is going to be a high-risk situation pretty much anywhere. So what is it that we're talking about here?</p>
                        <p>0:17:40.2 Peter: Right. If you buy a gun, do you need to see it shoot someone to know it's dangerous or is it enough to know how guns work?</p>
                        <p>0:17:48.7 Rhiannon: Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:17:50.7 Peter: So the Court then says that the order could have been tailored to the size and capacity of the relevant buildings, which I think is fair enough, they could have done capacity restrictions. I think there's a good argument that capacity restrictions make more sense than pure head count caps, so fine. But in my view, that's just sort of an irrelevant argument because there's zero reason to believe that religious institutions are being singled out and unfairly targeted. It would also be fine to just ban them altogether like concert venues, but instead, they were given this sort of additional privilege of, "You can have 10 or 25 or whatever people." So even if you believe that the hard caps on capacity don't make much sense, that as conservatives so often say, doesn't necessarily mean it's unconstitutional.</p>
                        <p>0:18:36.2 Peter: So we noted that two concurrences are filed here, one by Gorsuch, one by Kavanaugh, both of them a little bit crazier than the per curiam opinion. The only thing I'll say about Kavanaugh's concurrence is that it substantively adds almost nothing to the other opinions, and this is like the third or fourth time I've thought that about a Kavanaugh concurrence. My boy just, he loves to file a concurrence.</p>
                        <p>0:19:00.5 Rhiannon: He loves to repeat what we just read and just put his name on it at the top.</p>
                        <p>0:19:06.1 Michael: Yeah. But put it in his own voice. No, that's... Peter made this point when we were prepping for this episode, it was like this moment of clarity for me in understanding Brett Kavanaugh, because like in any fraternity, there's like a dude, who he drinks two beers and then cannot shut the fuck up. He just loves the sound of his voice and will just fucking yammer on, and I know that guy well because it was me in my fraternity.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:19:36.7 Michael: So, no judgment on Brett on that point, but it's like a thing where, once you see it, it's like, "Oh, yeah, I know this guy."</p>
                        <p>0:19:45.2 Rhiannon: That's him.</p>
                        <p>0:19:46.0 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:19:46.3 Rhiannon: And even if you weren't in a fraternity, Brett Kavanaugh is exactly the guy that I had intense culture shock over 1L year. You know this person from 1L con law or civ pro. It's a white man who, for his entire life, has been told things like, "Oh, you're really good at debate, you should go to law school."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:20:08.8 Rhiannon: They've just been stoked with that kind of praise their entire life. And so, they get a platform, and they can't say no.</p>
                        <p>0:20:16.1 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:20:16.3 Peter: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:20:16.9 Michael: That's right. I was told I was good at debate and I should go to law school.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:20:18.7 Rhiannon: Yeah, I know your kind.</p>
                        <p>0:20:24.9 Peter: We already talked a bit about Gorsuch's concurrence, ranting about what he sees as secular privilege. But probably the most notable thing about it is just how sanctimonious it is, generally. The concurrence starts off with the line quote, "Government is not free to disregard the First Amendment in times of crisis."</p>
                        <p>0:20:44.4 Rhiannon: Okay.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:20:47.2 Peter: And the tone of his concurrence is all along the same lines. His position is not just that they're right, but that any other position is clearly disregarding the Constitution. And that's just fucking stupid. You could take that tone if the First Amendment said, "During pandemics, you can't put capacity restrictions on churches." If that's what it said, I'd be like, "You got me, Neil. That's right."</p>
                        <p>0:21:12.0 Rhiannon: Yeah. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:21:13.6 Peter: But the First Amendment says that it protects the free exercise of religion. Every single person who has ever studied it understands that that entails a massive gray area and requires a balancing act between the freedom to engage in specific religious activities and public policy needs. I think the Court's position here is bad and wrong, but even I will tell you that there is no objectively correct answer here. And to act as if there is shows a wild amount of hubris and over-confidence. And I think it's a good sign that we are not about to see a restrained conservative Court.</p>
                        <p>0:21:49.3 Rhiannon: Really good point.</p>
                        <p>0:21:50.0 Michael: I think that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:21:51.0 Rhiannon: Yeah. So, one of the big stories here is that Roberts joined the liberals in dissent. And Roberts' dissent dodges the merits of the constitutional question. He's making the argument that the case is moot because the churches and synagogues in question are no longer in the designated red zones, and therefore, the hard attendance caps no longer even apply to them. Roberts' argument is that we should not be issuing an opinion here where the situation can still be changing day-to-day. This is classic Roberts equivocation, trying to dodge the touchier issue. Sometimes conservatives, and the occasional centrist, criticize us for not giving more credence to the conservative side of the argument. And generally, I would like to respond, "Go fuck yourself." But...</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:22:37.8 Michael: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:22:39.1 Rhiannon: But I'll give you this. I think Roberts is wrong, and this case is not moot. It's true that the churches are no longer in the red zones, but that can easily change at any time. And in any event, the case is relevant to other houses of worship. So, calling this moot is just ticky-tack procedural bullshit. And Roberts is kinda being... Flat-out, he's being cowardly, because he doesn't want to address the real issues here.</p>
                        <p>0:23:03.7 Peter: Right, right. Yeah, Roberts and Gorsuch get into it a little bit in their opinions. Some of it's very technical and dry, but Roberts calls out Gorsuch for the condescending language he uses. Roberts' response is very weak. He just said that dissenters, quote, "View the matter differently, after careful study and analysis, reflecting their best efforts to fulfill their responsibility under the Constitution."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:23:26.9 Peter: And this reminds me very much of the broader Court's interaction with Antonin Scalia, who Gorsuch is trying to emulate to what I would consider to be an embarrassing degree.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:23:38.7 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:23:38.9 Peter: Scalia was famously venomous when he disagreed with his colleagues, veering into outright disrespect without much hesitation at all. And his colleagues' response was generally to ignore his histrionics and maintain a measured tone no matter what he said. In my view, that approach was catastrophic, leading to a generation of conservative attorneys like Neil Gorsuch, who believed that Scalia was untouchable, that he was intellectually superior, that he was revered and feared by his colleagues. His sort of like boisterous over-confidence went unaddressed for the duration of his career, and it helped build a marketable brand, not just around him, but around his type of conservative jurisprudence. Scalia was never as sharp as he thought he was. Gorsuch is even less sharp. I would suggest that someone on the Court put him in his place before history repeats itself here.</p>
                        <p>0:24:36.1 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:24:37.0 Michael: I think that's right. I do want to say, I think Roberts is being a little pragmatic in here, and that he is looking at the imminence of a vaccine and saying, "Look, we can just wait this out." [chuckle] "Just let the public health officials do what they want to do for a few more months, and then all these issues will be gone. And we won't potentially be responsible for tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths." Like, "We can take that hit. We can grit our teeth and bear it, and let the church restrictions go on till April." It's not the end of the fucking world. And he's saying, "If I have to engage in some legal bullshit and say this is moot, that's fine."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:25:17.0 Michael: It's better than the alternative, which is, making it much harder to control the pandemic.</p>
                        <p>0:25:23.1 Rhiannon: Yeah, totally. So, turning to the other dissent... So Justice Sotomayor writes a dissent. And predictably, it's well-written, it's smart, it goes through an easy to follow logical process. And she uses accessible language to explain why this case is basically turning doctrine on its head. She highlights how religious institutions are being singled out here for preferential treatment, like we said before, which is why the Court has no grounds for applying heightened levels of scrutiny to these laws. She says, quote, "Free religious exercise is one of our most treasured and jealously guarded constitutional rights. States may not discriminate against religious institutions even when faced with a crisis as deadly as this one. But those principles are not at stake today, the Constitution does not forbid states from responding to public health crises through regulations that treat religious institutions equally or more favorably than comparable secular institutions, particularly when those regulations save lives."</p>
                        <p>0:26:27.0 Michael: Right, and I'm especially glad that she points out that the conservatives here are entirely full of shit on a particular issue which is related to statements from public officials, because one thing the majority tries to do here is it cites to statements from Andrew Cuomo talking about the spread of COVID in Hasidic communities, and the majority wants to say this is the evidence that the regulations and the red zones and the orange zones were designed to target religious groups, and Sotomayor rightly notes that, look, there's a case directly on point about this question, Trump v. Hawaii, the Muslim ban case, in which the conservatives flat out said that Donald Trump saying that they're trying to ban all Muslims from entering the country shouldn't in fact, make the Court suspicious that there's religious discrimination going on. That was the holding of that case.</p>
                        <p>0:27:24.7 Michael: If you haven't listened to our episode on Trump v. Hawaii I suggest you go back and do so now and then have a heart attack when your blood pressure just skyrockets, knowing how they're going to do a complete about-face on this issue. I think calling people hypocrites is kind of weak sometimes, but in this case, it's just like you can't avoid how obviously, bullshit it is. I do want to say also, though, that I thought her dissent was a little weak on what I think is an important point, which is that a lot of people are going to undoubtedly die because of this decision. If she had said that, I'm sure the majority and concurrences would have lambasted her as engaging in overheated rhetoric and demagoguery and saying it's all speculation and blah, blah, blah...</p>
                        <p>0:28:13.0 Michael: But it's not any of those things. It's just a fact and she should have stated it plainly, conservatives are killing people with this decision. And if they think that's the price we pay for religious freedom, you know, they should say so openly and honestly. Instead, she sort of dances around the point twice, once in the line Rhi quoted above about the regulations "saving lives" and also when she says Justices for this court play a deadly game in second-guessing the expert judgment of health officials, blah, blah, blah, blah blah. And it's like, come on, don't say it's a deadly game, just fucking say it, say what everybody knows. I just think it's weak. I think this is just going to cost a lot of people their lives, many of whom didn't attend religious services, but just got stuck ringing up some reckless asshole getting groceries a couple of days after going to a crowded church, and those people deserve something more from the dissent.</p>
                        <p>0:29:11.4 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's a great point. And I want to make a point too about the politicization of the shadow docket. I said up top that it's significant that this is a shadow docket case, because it could be that the Justices are hearing criticism about all these important decisions coming down without any sort of written rationalization or explanation of who comprise the majority, but I don't want to discount like Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch. This is a victory lap.</p>
                        <p>0:29:40.5 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:29:42.0 Rhiannon: They are deeply religiously conservative and they've switched the make up of the Court, and they won here, and there's no reason for three separate opinions saying the same thing, and so we shouldn't discount like the extent to which these weirdos who represent a deeply and idiosyncratically conservative legal mindset took advantage of an opportunity to do culture war theatrics on a shadow docket case on which they didn't hear the merits. In fact, it's unusual to have even one written opinion in a case like this, so the usual procedure for a case on the shadow docket is that the Court just gives a thumbs up or a thumbs down based on whether the case when it is heard is likely to win or lose on the merits. These are mini Scalia freaks who consider themselves genius little proteges or whatever, and they're just flexing, they're just flexing in the same way that Donald Trump might give some sort of token speech or a photo opportunity in front of a church to speak to his base.</p>
                        <p>0:30:44.0 Peter: Right, right. They're stunting on the liberals...</p>
                        <p>0:30:47.1 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:30:47.6 Michael: You write those two concurrences to say, and fuck you too.</p>
                        <p>0:30:52.4 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:30:52.8 Peter: I want to talk a little bit about the First Amendment more broadly. This is a case about the free exercise of religion, but that's only one of two clauses in the First Amendment concerning religion. The other is the establishment clause, which says that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, and there's sort of an inherent tension between these two clauses, because they are requiring that the government afford people the right to engage in religious practices, but not go so far as to actively endorse or facilitate those practices. And the irony is that the Court's holding here borders on requesting that states violate the establishment clause by going out of their way to cater to religious institutions.</p>
                        <p>0:31:35.1 Peter: New York made an active effort to treat religious services equally or better than what it felt were comparable businesses and venues, and the Court found that that still wasn't enough, and that's where I think we're going to see First Amendment jurisprudence go where the Court champions the free exercise clause while marginalizing the establishment clause, forcing governments to consistently draft laws that are overtly designed to accommodate religion rather than drafting laws that are indifferent to religion, which is what the First Amendment should require. And I don't want to get too deep in this, but there was a case that was written by Scalia himself.</p>
                        <p>0:32:12.6 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:32:13.9 Peter: Employment Division v. Smith, I think, from 1990 or so, where the Court held this, again, this is Scalia writing it, saying that laws are supposed to be indifferent to religion. If something just so happens to coincidentally negatively impact a religion, that's not against the First Amendment. I believe that there is a good chance that we see that functionally overturned by the Court over the span of the next several years.</p>
                        <p>0:32:39.5 Michael: I think that's right. And switching gears a little, Peter and Rhiannon have laid out the law really well, and at the danger of just reiterating what they've said, I'm just not convinced that the First Amendment has anything meaningful to tell us here. Like if houses of worship were being outright shuttered while people were out at concerts and shit or there were stricter limits for Hasidic Jews than for Christians, sure, okay, yeah, that sounds like the right scenario for the First Amendment, but what we're talking about here is whether the capacity limits, which are presumptively legitimate, are too strict, and whether they should have used a percentage of total capacity rather than a hard count. The Court is literally micro-managing the Governor of New York's response to a catastrophic pandemic, that at the time of this recording afflicted over 650,000 New Yorkers, killing over 34,000 of them, and what they're saying is, we get to nitpick that response to the pandemic. It's profoundly anti-federalist, it's profoundly anti-democratic, it's just absurd, and I think doing it under the guise of the First Amendment is a joke.</p>
                        <p>0:33:56.5 Peter: Absolutely. So final thoughts, one of the best things about this for me, was that the Pope immediately published an op-ed supporting restrictions like these...</p>
                        <p>0:34:07.0 Michael: Yeah, it ruled. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:34:07.1 Peter: And very expectedly, the reaction of conservative Catholics has mostly been to reject the Pope. You are an adult in a religion where the central principle is that there's this one dude who is essentially the infallible mouthpiece of God, part of a line of succession that started with Jesus's appointment of St. Peter himself, and then that dude's like, "Hey, maybe try not to get other people sick," and the Republicans are like, "Who's this fucking guy?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:34:39.9 Rhiannon: "Who died and made you king?" and it was like, "Ah, literally Jesus."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:34:50.0 Peter: Literally, you could just watch on Twitter and in op-eds, etcetera, all of these conservative Catholics just slowly crawling towards Protestantism because the fucking Pope didn't fully endorse the conservative political position on this. I think that touches on something that's very important to this country's conception of freedom of religion, and that is the merger of institutionalized religion and politics in this country. This is something that has been researched and written about and talked about fairly extensively, but even a casual observer can see how many hot button political issues are intertwined with religion, to a point where disentangling them almost seems like a fool's errand, it's nonsensical.</p>
                        <p>0:35:37.3 Peter: You can't have a discussion about abortion or LGBT rights that is either partisan or religious, it's inherently both. And this stems at least in part, from a concerted effort by monied interests on the right to push religious issues in the political sphere and political issues in the religious sphere, and the result is a milieu where the basic conservative position is that the First Amendment's protection of religious practices functions to protect their political viewpoints.</p>
                        <p>0:36:09.0 Peter: When you see someone say that they don't want to bake a cake for a gay couple, or that they're concerned about working with trans people, or in this case, thinks that their right to go to church in the pandemic should not be mitigated, is that really about religion? To use the religion at issue here, as an example, all of those beliefs are certainly held by some Catholics. They might be shared by many or most conservative Catholics, but are they shared by all Catholics? Or is it more accurate to say that it's the shared belief of a subset of Catholics who are, not coincidentally, politically conservative?</p>
                        <p>0:36:45.3 Rhiannon: Ding, ding, ding.</p>
                        <p>0:36:46.5 Peter: Isn't the determinative factor, then, their politics rather than their religion? And look, I'm not saying that as if it's definitively true, this is a gray area for sure, but the Court has essentially allowed many almost nakedly partisan beliefs to parade themselves around as if they are purely the manifestation of religion, when anyone who's looking closely can see that the truth is not that simple.</p>
                        <p>0:37:11.3 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:37:12.2 Peter: So if you doubt us about the sort of potential scope of this decision, know that a case has already been filed in Kentucky challenging the closure of religious schools due to COVID. Note that all schools are closed in Kentucky and they are simply saying, "Well, that shouldn't include religious schools." And to me, that signals that the conservative bar is strategizing and thinking about how far they can stretch this, and that is clearly dangerous.</p>
                        <p>0:37:48.2 Rhiannon: Right, and a more concerning case came out of California where a church was asking the Supreme Court for emergency relief against the California COVID restrictions, and that case actually has already been sent back from the Supreme Court to California, basically in light of this opinion, which signals that the Supreme Court is telling lower courts in California to side with religious organizations like they have here.</p>
                        <p>0:38:15.9 Michael: It's sending a signal to churches, to lawyers, to conservative advocacy groups, and most importantly to lower courts that the Court no longer has much appetite for regulations at all on religious institutions. And this case is in a lot of ways an easier case than the more neutral regulations that were upheld back in the spring. And so I think we should consider this a green light for right-wing conservative religious groups to challenge COVID restrictions anywhere, and a clear signal to courts that they should be entertaining those challenges seriously. And that's going to result in a lot more people getting sick in and a lot more people dying. And I'll also just say, I feel like there's more urgency to this stuff now that the vaccine is imminent.</p>
                        <p>0:39:16.6 Michael: So it's not like every single day you can delay opening up of establishments like churches and synagogues or gyms, if you can, or whatever. I just feel like district court judges should just be like, "Fuck you." Like, alright, we'll reconsider in light of it, and then make some fine distinctions between these regulations and the regulations in New York and just say, "These are fine," even in light of that decision, and I'm sure there's going to be like expedited review and all that stuff, but that stuff still takes time, and they should just delay, delay, delay. And that could save lives.</p>
                        <p>0:39:57.1 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:39:57.4 Peter: Absolutely. And, to take a step further back here and talk about the implications of these broad conservative conception of the First Amendment protections of their religion and speech rights, the Eleventh Circuit just a couple of weeks ago struck down bans on conversion therapy. Conversion therapy is, if you don't know, the extremely anti-scientific and deeply morally disgusting practice of trying to convert gay children to become straight using what is essentially psychological torture. The Eleventh Circuit said that conversion therapy was protected as free speech under the First Amendment, and, that's not a freedom of religion thing, at least in this case, but, it goes to show exactly how they use the First Amendment as a weapon for their cause, just disgusting shit.</p>
                        <p>0:40:52.7 Michael: You guys ever get sort of maximally solipsistic and be like, "Actually, this is all just a grand experiment to see what it would take to get me to kill someone."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:41:06.3 Rhiannon: We must be in a simulation because... This is... It's just a... It's a test.</p>
                        <p>0:41:11.4 Peter: When that one dropped, I couldn't even process it, I was just sort of like, "I'm going to move on. I'm... "</p>
                        <p>0:41:16.2 Rhiannon: Right. Like I can't... I can't process this right now.</p>
                        <p>0:41:18.8 Michael: Yeah. And a final point, I think the biggest, most important point of all for this episode is that a lot of you thought you were so clever on Twitter and were like, "Are you going to rename to 6-3?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:41:33.0 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:41:34.5 Michael: And I told you all at the fucking time, and I'm going to say it again, there are still going to be 5-4 decisions, and they're going to be worse than ever.</p>
                        <p>0:41:43.3 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:41:43.5 Michael: 'Cause that's what's going to happen, is the conservative bar is going to just keep testing the limits, and they can afford to lose a Roberts or a Gorsuch or a Kavanaugh here and there, and still win.</p>
                        <p>0:41:53.3 Peter: Also, it's a metaphor about the ideological split of the Court, okay? It's not a literal description of every case.</p>
                        <p>0:42:00.3 Rhiannon: Yes. Yes. It is timeless. So fuck off.</p>
                        <p>0:42:02.6 Michael: Yeah, that's right. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:42:05.4 Michael: We love you, listeners.</p>
                        <p>0:42:06.7 Peter: Yes, thank you so much for listening. Buy our merch.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>

                        <p>0:00:00.0 [Archival]: We'll hear argument first this morning, in case, 07-1015, Ashcroft versus Iqbal.</p>
                        <p>0:00:08.5 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Prologue Projects. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Ashcroft v. Iqbal.</p>
                        <p>0:00:18.9 [Archival]: Javaid Iqbal is a Pakistani national, who was picked up in the wake of the September 11 attacks. He was deemed to be an individual of high interest, and was placed in the Special Housing Unit in the federal detention center in Brooklyn, New York. He subsequently alleged that he was beaten and denied medical care.</p>
                        <p>0:00:34.5 Leon Neyfakh: Iqbal made a point in his lawsuit of targeting top Bush Administration officials, not just their subordinates. The Supreme Court throughout the case, arguing that Iqbal had no way of knowing whether the higher-ups were responsible for what happened to him.</p>
                        <p>0:00:48.4 [Archival]: Is it plausible to think that after 9/11, high government officials might have used race as one of the bases for sweeping people up? And this is where the government says, "We don't think that's plausible."</p>
                        <p>0:01:02.7 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4 a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:01:13.8 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have locked out America's sun, like a California brush fire. [chuckle] I am Peter. I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:01:29.7 Rhiannon: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>0:01:30.6 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:01:31.4 Michael: Hi.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:01:32.2 Michael: Hello.</p>
                        <p>0:01:33.7 Rhiannon: Good one. Good human talking.</p>
                        <p>0:01:38.9 Peter: And today's case is Ashcroft v. Iqbal. This is a case about a Pakistani Muslim man living in Long Island, who tried to sue higher-up government officials for the racist treatment he experienced while in custody shortly after 9/11. But it's bigger than that, because what the court held here in a five to four decision, didn't just result in his lawsuit getting tossed out, it also resulted in it being substantially harder for anyone anywhere, but especially poor and less educated people to sue for anything at all.</p>
                        <p>0:02:13.2 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:02:13.6 Peter: I should note we will cover some of the ongoing Trump campaign, coup-adjacent shenanigans at the bottom of the episode. But for now, Ashcroft v. Iqbal. This case is fundamentally about a long-standing divide between the left and the right on just how difficult it should be to bring a lawsuit. Liberals on the court have generally taken the position that bringing a lawsuit should be simple. That if people have a dispute it's their right to have it resolved. Conservatives, however, have generally taken the position that litigation imposes a substantial burden on the people being sued and that steps should be taken to curb cases that they believe are frivolous.</p>
                        <p>0:02:54.2 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:02:54.6 Peter: One thing that we've discussed a few times in this podcast is the extent to which conservatives on the court rely on procedural mechanisms to protect powerful interests. And this is Exhibit A. Every law student in the country learns about this case during week one of civil procedure. And not only is this case, in and of itself a deeply racist product of the post 9/11 atmosphere in this country, it has also shaped, lawsuits are filed in America, and quietly taken its place as one of the most pro-big-business Supreme Court decisions in American history. So this decision is terrible in at least three ways. First, very racist, very racist.</p>
                        <p>0:03:38.0 Rhiannon: Yeah. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:03:38.3 Peter: Second, it makes it exceedingly difficult to hold the higher up government officials liable for the programs that they oversee. And third, it makes it harder to bring any lawsuit, moving forward, by requiring that lawsuits contain a higher level of specificity than was previously allowed. So instead of courts being a venue where someone who has been harmed can ask for, what's essentially an investigation of what happened, this case holds that the plaintiff needs to show in their initial lawsuit that their claims are plausible. Even though the evidentiary phase of the case has not begun. That might sound like a minor or technical thing, but it has completely reshaped litigation in this country with a very devastating impact on plaintiffs.</p>
                        <p>0:04:22.4 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:04:22.5 Michael: Right. And what your idea of plausible is, probably isn't gonna jive with what some federal society goon thinks think is plausible.</p>
                        <p>0:04:32.0 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:04:32.2 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:04:32.5 Michael: Just a reminder.</p>
                        <p>0:04:34.1 Peter: So, Rhi, walk us through the background here.</p>
                        <p>0:04:37.4 Rhiannon: Yeah. So before, maybe, getting into the factual background of the case, I do wanna make a quick note about law school and how law school teaches these cases. The details I have here about what happened to this man, Javaid Iqbal, in the wake of 9/11, in the United States, those facts don't come from the majority opinion in Ashcroft v. Iqbal. The facts don't come from the dissenting opinion, and they certainly don't come from how I was taught the case in Civil Procedure, my first semester of law school. I don't think it's an overstatement to say that the holding of this case had far-reaching consequences, like Peter already said, across all civil litigation. And the fact that it happened while the court and the legal profession sort of ignore, frankly, really important context and facts, it's crazy to me.</p>
                        <p>0:05:29.8 Rhiannon: And one important aspect of the many effects of this decision is how it contributes to our collective memory of how our government responded to 9/11 inside the United States. A lot of us were young, so we didn't pay attention or we didn't know, or if your only understanding of the government detention of immigrants in the wake of the September 11th attacks was from reading this decision, maybe, the US Government's actions would seem fairly limited in scope and maybe even pretty reasonable.</p>
                        <p>0:06:00.0 Michael: I don't think that was actually the case though. Is that where we're going?</p>
                        <p>0:06:04.6 Rhiannon: Yeah, that is actually not the case. So, the opinion, for example, starts with the following two sentences. This is literally how the majority opinion starts. Javaid Iqbal is a citizen of Pakistan and a Muslim. In the wake of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, he was arrested in the United States on criminal charges and detained by federal officials. Okay, so just from that. What is the natural inference here about what Mr. Iqbal is up to that got him arrested? Right?</p>
                        <p>0:06:38.0 Michael: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>0:06:38.1 Peter: It seems like maybe he was involved.</p>
                        <p>0:06:40.6 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:06:41.7 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:06:42.1 Rhiannon: It seems like he's involved. It seems like he's a freaking member of Al-Qaeda, right?</p>
                        <p>0:06:47.0 Michael: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>0:06:47.9 Rhiannon: Like it's something that he's involved in some way. So actually let's talk about the facts, which I had to do some real digging and research to find. So backing it up a little bit, in 1992, Javaid Iqbal arrived in the United States from Faisalabad, Pakistan with a false passport that he got from immigration smugglers. Now, he made a home in Long Island, and Mr. Iqbal worked long hours at multiple jobs for about a decade, and he did so to send money to family back in Pakistan. For example, he worked in Huntington, Long Island as a gas station attendant, sometimes he worked for seven days a week. He opened the gas station at 5:00 AM, he closed it at 10:00 PM. He also worked as a cash register clerk at a 7-Eleven, he made sandwiches at Subway, he washed dishes at a bar, at various times, he also worked graveyard shift as a security guard.</p>
                        <p>0:07:40.3 Michael: And if you don't think that's tough enough, remember, he was living in fucking Long Island.</p>
                        <p>0:07:44.0 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:07:44.6 Michael: As a brown man. Can you imagine?</p>
                        <p>0:07:47.6 Rhiannon: Great point. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:07:48.7 Michael: Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>0:07:50.3 Rhiannon: Yeah, but by his own account, actually, he loved living and working in the United States. His favorite job, according to him, and the one that he had at the time that he was arrested was as a cable repair technician. He called himself the Cable Guy because The Cable Guy is his favorite movie.</p>
                        <p>0:08:09.8 Peter: What kind of Pakistani immigrant is a huge fan of The Cable Guy?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:08:15.6 Rhiannon: One who loves America.</p>
                        <p>0:08:19.7 Michael: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:08:20.8 Peter: Yeah, maybe a little too much.</p>
                        <p>0:08:21.9 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:08:23.8 Rhiannon: He said in an interview that he loved the work because of the people he met, and quote "Every dollar makes a difference. I send money home and I will change my family's life." Mr. Iqbal, in fact, married an American woman and lived with her and her children. The two did end up splitting after about five years of marriage, and it's important to note that for part of his time in the United States, Mr. Iqbal was working using a false identity, because he was undocumented, and doing so, it's a pretty common feature actually of many undocumented immigrants' working life in the United States.</p>
                        <p>0:08:56.9 Peter: Right. 'Cause you need a social security number to get jobs.</p>
                        <p>0:09:00.5 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:09:00.6 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:09:00.7 Rhiannon: But in Mr. Iqbal's case, that false identity ends up factoring pretty heavily into the allegations of criminal activity that lead to his detention here. So, less than two months after September 11th, in November 2001, Mr. Iqbal is unexpectedly... He has no idea that he was being investigated, he was arrested by two men who were wearing civilian clothing, who just show up at his house one night. They accused him of lying about who he was and why he was in the United States, and he was eventually charged with identity fraud. Basically because he had obtained a driver's license with that false name that he had been using for work and for possessing the false Social Security card. Now, that's where his really horrific stay in federal custody begins. Initially, Mr. Iqbal is incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, and he's kept with the general inmate population for a couple of months. But at some point, and actually to this day, it remains unclear why this happened, Mr. Iqbal was added to a list of over 100 of federally detained individuals who were supposedly connected to the September 11th investigation. So for example, there's an FBI list from early 2002 that identifies Mr. Iqbal, but it notes only that he was using a fraudulent passport and was charged with making false statements, and that was in the section that was supposed to provide a factual narrative of the case.</p>
                        <p>0:10:29.0 Rhiannon: So it's really unclear why he was ever attached to the investigation of terrorism from September 11th. So again, without knowing why, but likely related to him being on this list, Mr. Iqbal was transferred in January 2002 to the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit that's also as ADMAX SHU, or just The SHU, and he's kept there for the next six months. And what followed was really just awful abuse to him personally, as well as to the group of Muslim men that is detained in the same conditions at this time. So the night he was transferred to this heightened security isolation housing, Mr. Iqbal was severely beaten by multiple officers, they kicked and punched him, they threw him against the wall, he was left bleeding from multiple places on his head and face, and then in March, he was subjected to another severe attack, and this one was in retaliation for Mr. Iqbal protesting the fourth strip and body cavity search of that day. He was left bloody after that attack, after being badly beaten by officers, and an officer also urinated in his cell, and then shut the water off so that Mr. Iqbal couldn't flush until the next day. And Mr. Iqbal's repeated requests for medical attention, because he is severely injured, obviously, those requests are denied for more than two weeks.</p>
                        <p>0:12:01.8 Michael: I just wanna say something, and this isn't really, it's not meant anything towards you, but I just... The term body cavity search sounds so sanitized to me.</p>
                        <p>0:12:11.1 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:12:11.8 Michael: I feel like it's sexual assault, right?</p>
                        <p>0:12:15.5 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:12:16.4 Michael: If you're body cavity searching someone four times a day, that's just fucking assault.</p>
                        <p>0:12:18.7 Peter: Right, that's sexual assault.</p>
                        <p>0:12:19.2 Rhiannon: That's absolutely right. And they do it too to specifically to Muslim detainees, because of the religious conceptions of modesty and stuff like that.</p>
                        <p>0:12:28.1 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:12:29.7 Rhiannon: So that kind of physical abuse, the beatings, that doesn't even really touch the day-to-day harassment and abuse that Mr. Iqbal and other Muslim prisoners received, being caged in The SHU, that means that they lived in lockdown, in isolation for 23 hours a day. The remaining hour that they were permitted to be outside their cells, they were handcuffed and had leg irons on them, and they were always accompanied by a four-officer escort team. On rainy days, Mr. Iqbal was left outside until he was drenched, soaking wet, and then when he was brought back to his cell, guards would turn the air conditioning up so that he would be really cold. On cold winter mornings, the jailers would take groups of Muslim prisoners outside without clothes and they made fun of them while they tried to keep warm. Like I said, strip and body cavity searches. I mean, what is actually sexual assault were routine to all of these prisoners. And Mr. Iqbal was also deprived of adequate food and subjected to such harsh treatment that he lost more than 40 pounds over just a few months.</p>
                        <p>0:13:38.5 Rhiannon: Jailers routinely refused to let him and other Muslim prisoners pray, saying that they don't allow terrorists to pray, and other verbal abuse was super common. Using dehumanizing and pejorative language, saying two Muslim detainees, stuff like, "This facility is where terrorists come to die. You're never gonna go home. Your family, your country is going to be decimated. This is what you get for attacking America." Those kinds of things.</p>
                        <p>0:14:07.7 Michael: These guys are also from Long Island, apparently.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:14:13.0 Peter: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:14:14.2 Rhiannon: Yeah. Eventually, Mr. Iqbal pleads guilty to one count of using the false Social Security card, and after he finishes his sentence, he is deported to Pakistan and he signs voluntary removal paperwork where he agrees basically that he will not come back to the United States for at least 10 years.</p>
                        <p>0:14:39.7 Peter: Wait. Wait. The guy who was, what? Shackled, beaten, starved, raped, and tortured, voluntarily left the country and said, he doesn't wanna come back, that's naïve. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:14:53.0 Rhiannon: Yeah. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:14:53.6 Peter: I'm shocked that guy is not banging down the doors to get back in here.</p>
                        <p>0:14:57.8 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:14:58.4 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:15:00.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, he at that point, didn't... He just didn't believe that the American government would let somebody stay who had been labeled a terrorist or investigated as a terrorist, and he was like, "Yeah, get me out of here."</p>
                        <p>0:15:11.5 Peter: Right, right. I mean, you'd never be safe here again.</p>
                        <p>0:15:13.8 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. So he was like, "Get me out of here." And so once he gets back to Pakistan, Mr. Iqbal sues. He sues based on the racially motivated discrimination and abuse that he suffered while he was in federal custody inside the United States.</p>
                        <p>0:15:31.6 Peter: So more specifically, he sues a couple of higher-up government officials, John Ashcroft and Robert Mueller. I don't know if you guys know about him.</p>
                        <p>0:15:42.6 Rhiannon: Hey, that name sounds familiar.</p>
                        <p>0:15:44.5 Peter: Yeah. Saying that they oversaw and helped implement a discriminatory program that targeted Muslims, right? And targeted people from the Middle East. But the court rejects Iqbal's allegations saying that they aren't plausible because there was no way that Iqbal could be sure that Ashcroft and Mueller had overseen the discrimination in the program. And the fundamental legal question here is very simple. How specific does a lawsuit have to be? In other words, everyone knows you can't file a lawsuit that is purely frivolous. If I sued Michael for wearing a shirt I didn't like, the court would throw it out because that's not illegal. When you file a lawsuit, you need to describe what the person you're suing did that was illegal. But the question, in this case, is how specific do you need to be when you do that?</p>
                        <p>0:16:37.3 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:16:37.5 Peter: Until this point, the courts had always said that it's enough that the allegations you make give the defendant enough information that they could reasonably understand the complaint and respond to it, but this case changes that standard for all future cases and raises the bar for future plaintiffs who wanna bring a case.</p>
                        <p>0:16:56.5 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:16:57.0 Peter: Procedures in the federal courts are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the bane of every first-year law students existence. [chuckle] And all they say about this is that a lawsuit must include a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," and the rule specifically says that "detailed factual allegations are not required." And despite the fact that the rule itself says you don't need anything specific, the Supreme Court holds in a five to four ruling with a majority written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, that federal lawsuits must state what it calls a plausible claim for relief. And the court says that Iqbal who alleged that Ashcroft and Mueller oversaw a discriminatory program, did not do so. So again, Iqbal is arrested in a fraud case in November in 2001. He is deemed a person of high interest in the September 11th attacks, and as a result, is placed in a special maximum security section of a prison where he is physically and verbally and sexually abused, denied medical care, denied his ability to engage in religious activity and denied access to counsel.</p>
                        <p>0:18:07.1 Peter: What he claims in his lawsuit is that being made a person of high interest in 9/11 and subjected to this treatment, was the result of a policy either directed or approved by Bush Administration officials like Ashcroft and Mueller, that discriminates against Muslims and Arabs. And what the court says, first, is basically that high-ranking government officials like them can't be held responsible for the illegal conduct of their subordinates, in this context. And usually, in the law, there's a concept called the respondeat superior, which means that if you are a manager, if you're someone in charge and your employees, the people who work for you, do something illegal, generally speaking, you'll be held responsible. And the court's basically saying "No, that doesn't apply to these government officials," which is a pretty weird position, because as the dissent points out, Ashcroft and Mueller themselves admitted to the court that they could be held responsible. They literally conceded that they could be held liable at least theoretically, but the majority just ignores that, pretends they didn't actually concede the point. So as a result, the opinion is sort of predicated in large part on an idea that even the government admit is false.</p>
                        <p>0:19:14.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. And the court taking on an issue that both parties agreed upon is really like out of bounds, especially for the more formalistic conservatives, right? The only reason they're doing it here is to go to bat for the Bush administration in a circumstance where there might be questions about their liability for their conduct in the war on terror. And we've said before on this podcast that Anthony Kennedy is not the brightest crayon in the box, not the sharpest tool in the shed, and when he's talking, this is just a stupidly needlessly offensive part of the opinion. I think when he's talking about respondeat superior, he defines it in the majority opinion by saying like, it's a part of the law "where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants." Can we think of a single fucking metaphor for explaining something that doesn't like harken back to when people owned slaves, like why? Why are we doing that, Anthony Kennedy?</p>
                        <p>0:20:14.3 Peter: Like why can't he just say subordinates?</p>
                        <p>0:20:15.8 Rhiannon: It doesn't make sense. He's just so stupid.</p>
                        <p>0:20:18.2 Michael: Masters and servants is just classic conservative legal-scholar type language.</p>
                        <p>0:20:24.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:20:24.5 Michael: Where they can like pretend that they're using sort of terms of art, but in reality, they just enjoy saying it.</p>
                        <p>0:20:29.5 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. It just has a nice ring to it.</p>
                        <p>0:20:32.7 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:20:33.0 Michael: So, the court then says, "Look, even if Ashcroft and Mueller could be held responsible, you're saying that they knew about this discriminatory policy, but you don't know that, you're just guessing.</p>
                        <p>0:20:43.6 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:20:43.9 Michael: And the court says that that's not enough for a lawsuit.</p>
                        <p>0:20:47.5 Peter: Which raises a big issue, which is of course he fucking doesn't know, right? No one's ever gonna know for certain what the higher-up government officials are engaging in, especially when they're engaging in wrong doing. They're not gonna be like... Well, in the Trump era maybe, they will be airing that publicly.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:21:04.9 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:21:05.9 Rhiannon: Lots of smoking guns in this administration.</p>
                        <p>0:21:08.5 Michael: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:21:09.7 Peter: Yeah, but for the most part, it's a pretty safe bet that you're just not gonna know what's happening. And since there's no real way to have access to that, this decision serves as functional immunity from civil lawsuit for higher-up government officials.</p>
                        <p>0:21:24.2 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:21:24.3 Michael: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:21:24.4 Peter: All they have to do is basically cover their tracks. And when you think about the other legal immunities available to them, like qualified immunity, which we've talked about, it's essentially impossible for a citizen to hold them accountable under this rubric.</p>
                        <p>0:21:37.2 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:21:38.4 Michael: So this creates a problem where someone can experience the output of a racist system, in this case, his discriminatory treatment in federal prison, but they can't do anything about it because they have no vision into the system to see who is ultimately responsible. The Court is basically saying that if government officials can, yeah, cover their tracks well enough, there's nothing you can do because you're just sort of guessing about what the government officials did.</p>
                        <p>0:22:03.4 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:22:03.8 Michael: But also, it's pretty fucking obvious that this dude was subjected to a racist policy of some kind, right?</p>
                        <p>0:22:09.5 Rhiannon: Exactly, yes.</p>
                        <p>0:22:10.1 Peter: He's not really guessing.</p>
                        <p>0:22:11.4 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:22:11.5 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:22:11.7 Peter: This guy was originally jailed for using a false Social Security Number when he was like working at 7-Eleven.</p>
                        <p>0:22:17.3 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:22:18.8 Peter: He's then deemed a person of high interest in 9/11.</p>
                        <p>0:22:22.8 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:22:23.2 Peter: And by the way, as far as I'm aware, the government has never explained why that was the case, and I think we would have heard about it if there was a real good reason.</p>
                        <p>0:22:29.9 Rhiannon: Right. If he planned 9/11, I think they would have said that, right, like there would be a story.</p>
                        <p>0:22:35.1 Michael: Yeah. He would still be in fucking Guantanamo Bay if he was actually involved in 9/11.</p>
                        <p>0:22:38.9 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:22:39.9 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:22:40.9 Peter: Yeah, of course. The most likely explanation for what happened here is they saw a Muslim guy committing identity fraud in the general vicinity of 9/11 and figured, "Fuck it. Better safe than sorry. Let's lock this guy up."</p>
                        <p>0:22:53.2 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:22:53.7 Peter: Which is absolutely discrimination on the basis of his race and religion, like no question.</p>
                        <p>0:22:58.0 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:22:58.9 Rhiannon: Exactly. We also know that shortly, after 9/11, the government was extremely frivolous with its designations of quote-unquote, "persons of high interest" in the September 11th attacks. So like in 2003, the Department of Justice published a report on the detention center that Mr. Iqbal was being held in, and that report found that the FBI and INS made little attempt to differentiate between detainees who were and were not affiliated with terrorism. And also, that the methods the government used to identify persons of high interest were both imprecise and inconsistent.</p>
                        <p>0:23:34.9 Peter: Right, and yeah, the court does not address any of this.</p>
                        <p>0:23:39.4 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:23:39.5 Peter: Instead, Kennedy does his own sort of half-baked analysis where he basically says, in so many words, "Look, obviously, anti-terrorism efforts are going to disproportionally impact Muslims because Muslims did it."</p>
                        <p>0:23:52.3 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:23:53.1 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:23:54.3 Peter: To make an anti-terrorism omelet, you gotta break a few Muslim civil rights eggs.</p>
                        <p>0:24:00.7 Michael: That's some class.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:24:00.8 Michael: That's the gist.</p>
                        <p>0:24:03.2 Peter: That's the message, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:24:04.6 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:24:05.6 Peter: That's basically as close to like a Fox News talking point as you can get. The general philosophy of the conservative movement at the time was just like, "Let's get them all. Fuck it, we're going absolutely nuts at these people."</p>
                        <p>0:24:19.5 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:24:19.6 Michael: Who was it? Who said like the sand was gonna be glowing green or whatever?</p>
                        <p>0:24:23.6 Peter: Yeah, like the conservative position after 9/11 was, "Nuke the entire Middle East."</p>
                        <p>0:24:30.8 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:24:30.9 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:24:31.0 Peter: The moderate conservative position was like, "Just Afghanistan." And then it goes down from there.</p>
                        <p>0:24:33.1 Michael: And then invade the entire Middle East. That was me, the middle guy.</p>
                        <p>0:24:35.0 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:24:35.1 Peter: Yeah, George W. Bush was taking the leftmost position of the Republican party when he just invaded two countries.</p>
                        <p>0:24:42.5 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:24:43.3 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:24:44.7 Peter: So the court's position is a total dodge. The question isn't whether this disproportionately impacts Muslims, it's whether it's targeting Muslims regardless of any tangible connection to terrorism, which of course it is, 100% no questions asked.</p>
                        <p>0:24:58.6 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:25:00.3 Peter: This guy was a fucking 7-Eleven clerk that got thrown into a federal prison right after 9/11 and is being called a terrorist by guards. We don't need to pretend that we don't know what this is about.</p>
                        <p>0:25:10.6 Rhiannon: Exactly, right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:11.9 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:11.9 Peter: It's also important from a legal perspective to understand that what Kennedy is doing is questioning the accuracy of the lawsuit that Iqbal filed but that is sort of procedurally improper. The court, when litigation is first filed is supposed to assume that the allegations are true. So you take the example I provided earlier where I'm suing Micheal for wearing a shirt I don't like, the court dismisses that, because even if you assume it's true, he's still not breaking the law.</p>
                        <p>0:25:38.8 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:38.9 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:25:39.0 Peter: But the key is that they still have to assume that it's true.</p>
                        <p>0:25:42.9 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:25:44.0 Peter: Kennedy isn't doing that. He's sort of interrogating whether or not the allegations are correct, but that's not the court's role. That's what discovery is for. Discovery is the stage of litigation where you identify and review evidence and the court is even letting it get to that stage.</p>
                        <p>0:25:58.7 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, and something that just occurred to me is that Kennedy and the conservative majority, they're not just not taking the allegations as true, they're not just sort of questioning the accuracy or veracity of Mr. Iqbal's allegations. They are questioning those things, but then giving the benefit of the doubt to the government's reasons for picking up, for detaining all of these immigrants.</p>
                        <p>0:26:22.8 Michael: Right, their justifications, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:26:24.3 Rhiannon: Exactly, and you can see this in the opinion, right? There is a part of the opinion that's particularly sort of... Wait, what? Are you a Fox News commentator? It goes like this, "The September 11th attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers, who counted themselves members in good standing of Al-Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist group. Al-Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim, Osama Bin Laden, and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples. It should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks, would produce a disparate incidental impact on Arab Muslims."</p>
                        <p>0:27:09.1 Peter: Incidental, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:27:09.9 Rhiannon: Incidental, yeah. And he goes on. "On the facts that Mr. Iqbal alleges, the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by a non-discriminatory intent."</p>
                        <p>0:27:23.8 Michael: I'm so angry.</p>
                        <p>0:27:24.9 Peter: I love that they keep saying, "Arab Muslim" when everyone involved is Saudi. That's because the sponsors of the next cocktail party that the Federalist Society was hosting was some collection of Saudi princes. But also this guy is Pakistani, which they mentioned in the first line and never again, it's like very fucking bizarre.</p>
                        <p>0:27:44.3 Rhiannon: Right, this man is not Arab.</p>
                        <p>0:27:45.5 Peter: Yeah, for our less educated listeners, Pakistan is South Asia, not considered an Arab country.</p>
                        <p>0:27:51.5 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. Ethnically different. So that quote to me, just goes to show how much work the court is doing for the government when actually they're supposed to be taking Mr. Iqbal's allegations as true.</p>
                        <p>0:28:05.9 Michael: Right, they call it a legitimate policy, when whether or not it's legitimate is precisely what's in question, in the lawsuit.</p>
                        <p>0:28:12.7 Rhiannon: Exactly. That's the question, if whether this policy was legitimate or discriminatory.</p>
                        <p>0:28:16.3 Michael: Right. And look, this outcome isn't really surprising, that this is where we land. Obviously, like Peter was saying, this is a period of anti-Muslim hysteria generally, and especially on the right, but across the ideological spectrum. And it's very consonant with our history as a country. We've seen discrimination claims go right out the window during wartime many times in the recent past, most infamously, when the Supreme Court blessed Japanese internment during World War II. We've also talked on the podcast about harsh anti-communist immigration decisions during the Cold War. And this is all, I think, part of a larger phenomenon in conservative politics generally, and in conservative legal circles as well. The technical term for it is "boot-licking".</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:29:14.1 Michael: The output of boot-licking is effectively giving up on the rule of law, in times of quote-unquote "Emergency in war time." It doesn't happen by accident. There are some prominent conservative academics, Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule.</p>
                        <p>0:29:30.7 Rhiannon: Perfect villain name.</p>
                        <p>0:29:31.3 Peter: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:29:31.5 Michael: Well, they are both freaks in their own special ways. But so they wrote a book after 9/11 called "Terror in the Balance", where they argued, in emergencies... Look, the executive is well suited to gauge the appropriate balance between civil liberties and security, and courts are ill-suited to second-guess that judgment. And so basically, the courts should just let the fucking president do whatever he wants, like, just go wild, man.</p>
                        <p>0:30:00.2 Rhiannon: Right, yeah. They love this.</p>
                        <p>0:30:01.5 Peter: Conservatives always pose this hypothetical where they say like, "Do you really want the courts making national security decisions?" And they try to suggest that the executive branch is better suited to it, but that's missing the point. Which is, we should avoid placing excessive discretion in the hands of any one branch of government. And they should be pushing and pulling at each other to avoid abuse of their own power. And the other aspect of this is, they are saying, "Do you really want the courts making national security decisions?" It's like, "Well, do you want some fucking moron like George W. Bush or Donald Trump making them?" Because that's the alternative.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:30:34.2 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:30:35.9 Peter: It's no great answer here, right?</p>
                        <p>0:30:39.4 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:30:40.0 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:30:40.4 Peter: But the real question is, do you want a check on the power of those morons? And, yes, yes I do.</p>
                        <p>0:30:45.0 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:30:45.2 Michael: Right, but these guys don't. And they believe so strongly in that, that they wrote a fucking book about it. I find the idea offensive in general, but it's hard for me to wrap my head around being so possessed with the idea that the government should be able to just trample everyone's civil liberties, that you write a fucking book about it. Then you're like, "This idea needs to be out in the world with my name on it, everybody needs to know this."</p>
                        <p>0:31:11.0 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:31:11.2 Michael: Oh, by the way, Vermeule is currently serving in the Trump Administration. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:31:14.7 Rhiannon: Great.</p>
                        <p>0:31:16.0 Michael: Like somebody that oversees the entire administrative state. So... No biggie. These guys are leading conservative intellectuals.</p>
                        <p>0:31:24.1 Peter: Yeah, it's as good as you're gonna get. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:31:25.3 Michael: Yes, it really is.</p>
                        <p>0:31:26.3 Rhiannon: This is the best and brightest of them.</p>
                        <p>0:31:28.2 Michael: The cream of the crop. And so they shrug off the idea... There's a common complaint here, you see, which is that like, "Look, if you sacrifice civil liberties during times of war, you'll never get them back." Once they're gone, they won't come back. And they shrug it off and say, "No, that's not fucking true." Just as the emergency fades, things will get better, courts won't defer to the Executive as much.</p>
                        <p>0:31:47.9 Peter: That's why airports are great now, and you can just walk right through.</p>
                        <p>0:31:52.8 Michael: Right. Exactly. Right. The last two decades put the lie to that thesis, so comprehensively. Our entire society has been restructured around a permanent war footing and it'll take decades to undo it if we can do that.</p>
                        <p>0:32:06.3 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:32:07.3 Michael: And so circling back to this case, this is a perfect example of how fucking wrong they are and how fucking wrong Conservatives are on this point. The court is doing what they say, it's eliminating itself from the discussion about what is and isn't appropriate executive behavior in a time of national emergency. And saying, "Look, you don't even get to look into this." We don't even get to hear this lawsuit, because you need to have fucking ESP and be able to read the minds of John Ashcroft and Bob Mueller before you can sue them for this shit. Which effectively makes it impossible to sue. And this insurmountable bar has stayed in place for over a decade now, it didn't fade, it hasn't gotten better, and it hits on every corner of the law. Like we were saying before, it goes everywhere. It's civil rights litigation in all respects, not just discrimination and war. And this is precisely how this shit works. Civil liberties just get eroded the longer we're on this war footing. And this is maybe the quintessential example of that.</p>
                        <p>0:33:13.8 Peter: Yeah. And so this is where this case goes from being about the mistreatment of Iqbal himself, to something that transformed the litigation in this country in a way that benefits large corporations and other powerful interests.</p>
                        <p>0:33:25.7 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:33:27.6 Peter: In simple terms. This case made the bar for how detailed your lawsuits allegations have to be quite a bit higher than it was, which makes it harder to bring a successful lawsuit. More specifically, it gave the courts the greenlight to do what Kennedy is doing and sort of like question the allegations of the complaint before any evidence has actually been gathered, and this has resulted in courts dismissing lawsuits with a substantially higher frequency than they used to. Plaintiffs like Iqbal don't always have all of the facts at their disposal when the lawsuit is filed, and the standard that the court is creating here essentially leverages that against them. A good example of how this works is in discrimination cases, so let's say you were fired and you think it's because you were black or a woman, and you wanna file a lawsuit, 90% of the time, you're not gonna have specific evidence that that was the case, right? No one's gonna say, Oh, I'm firing you because you're black, I'm firing you because you're a woman, that's not how discrimination works in reality. The purpose of having a court case is to determine the truth of the matter, to figure out what actually happened, but because of this case, courts will often toss out cases that aren't specific enough about how they were discriminated against when the lawsuit's filed, so companies can often get these cases tossed out before the court even sees any evidence.</p>
                        <p>0:34:45.2 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:34:46.5 Peter: So if you're not a lawyer, you might be wondering like, who does this help? Who does this hurt? And in simple terms, it helps large companies the most because they defend a lot of lawsuits, and it makes it easier to throw lawsuits out, and when you're consistently defending lawsuits, getting an extra 10 or 20% of them thrown out is worth a fortune. That's why I stated up top that this is maybe on balance one of the most business-friendly decisions in history, and I don't think that's an exaggeration.</p>
                        <p>0:35:13.7 Rhiannon: Yeah, obviously the corollary is that this hurts plaintiffs, but more specifically, it hurts unsophisticated plaintiffs. Wealthier people who have access to more expensive lawyers, they are going to be much less troubled by this standard because those lawyers don't have as much trouble navigating all of this and putting together a lawsuit that can hold up to the higher standard that we get from Ashcroft v. Iqbal, but people who can't afford lawyers or who frankly can't afford good lawyers, run into the most trouble here, it's a really unforgiving rule that basically punishes people who aren't familiar with the legal system, and it also is extra protective of large companies and the government for the reasons that this case makes clear, people have limited vision into big organizations, so it's hard for them to specify in their lawsuits what exactly the organization did.</p>
                        <p>0:36:06.0 Peter: Right, so if you have a large company or the government, you're not in the room with Bob Mueller or John Ashcroft when they're designing some policy that ends up being racist.</p>
                        <p>0:36:17.3 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:36:18.1 Peter: You're not gonna have that sort of access to that information, this case allows your lack of access to result in your case getting tossed out because you're not allowed to get to the stage of litigation where you can actually get evidence and find out what happened. And we should talk for a moment about what a better system would look like, there's a very reasonable middle ground here, which to be frank, is where the courts were before the Supreme Court changed the standard. The question is, how specific does your lawsuit have to be? And it used to be specific enough that the other party would have notice about what you were talking about, and now...</p>
                        <p>0:36:51.7 Michael: It is pretty specific.</p>
                        <p>0:36:51.8 Peter: Is it plausible? That's completely different. That's a much higher bar. Basically, my view is that if a lawsuit seems to identify illegal activity and is not completely speculation, it should be allowed to continue period, that should be really the end of it. The legal system is supposed to be a way for us to address wrongdoing among private parties, so why should the courts stand in the way of that? The whole point of litigation is for evidence to be found and reviewed and analyzed so that people can draw conclusions, and this case has allowed Courts to essentially draw conclusions before any evidence is presented.</p>
                        <p>0:37:26.2 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:37:27.0 Michael: And I wanna take a minute to call out an underrated way in which the conservatives are just full of shit here. This isn't a constitutional decision, it's not a statutory interpretation decision, this is a case supposedly interpreting the rules governing the federal courts, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which that is all technically under Congress's legislative powers, but there's a law about this called the Rules Enabling Act, which basically gives that power to write these rules to this committee of judges called the Standing Committee, and everybody agrees that this case changed that standard. There's a reason why it's cited 85,000 times, it's the way it's taught in law school, it's the way everyone understands it, it was the entire fucking point, they rewrote the rule. And here's the thing, there's a process for rewriting the rules of civil procedure, and it's used regularly there's an advisory committee to the standing committee, and they take suggestions from academics and lawyers, they review them, they maybe propose publicly a draft, they take comments from activist groups and academics again, and then they move that up the ladder and then the standing committee.</p>
                        <p>0:38:36.9 Michael: If they like the rule, then they move it up the ladder to the Judicial Conference, and if they like it, and that's like the heads of all the circuit courts of the appeals, and a bunch of district judges, if they like it, it goes to the Supreme Court and then the Supreme Court can veto it, and if they like it, then it goes to Congress, and if Congress doesn't veto it, then it becomes a rule, this is a long process that requires broad buy-in across the ideological spectrum, a ton of public comment, a ton of advance notice and the supreme court is like well yeah fuck that though. Fuck you guys, fuck everyone, we're rewriting this rule the way we want it, and there's nothing you can do about it, because courts have to listen to us and we have veto power, if the standing committee wants to come and re-write the rule and say, No, actually you guys got it wrong, we can just fucking veto it.</p>
                        <p>0:39:27.2 Rhiannon: Right, it's pure, pure, purely gatekeeping. That's it.</p>
                        <p>0:39:31.1 Michael: Yeah, exactly. They are leveraging their position in this whole fucking system to bypass this elaborate process and enact their own agenda. It's pure policy making, and a pure exercise of political power. On a bright side to this though, that means that it can be overturned very simply. Legislation can overturn it. There was actually legislation to overturn it in 2009 in both houses of Congress, I don't know why they died, and I don't know if there's any movement, like if Democrats take the Senate, they're not really talking about Iqbal anymore, like they were back then, so who knows?</p>
                        <p>0:40:07.5 Peter: Right. So we should talk about what's driving this. We've mentioned once before, I think, that conservatives sincerely believe that the legal system is unfair to corporations and powerful people because they are often stuck in litigation. And so, you know, they're constantly defending against lawsuits and that's expensive, and they just think that's bullshit. They hate it.</p>
                        <p>0:40:26.3 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:40:26.8 Peter: So what conservatives have done is engage in what is essentially a PR campaign. We've talked about this a bit in the past too. How many times have you heard that America is an overly litigious society? Where there are too many frivolous lawsuits.</p>
                        <p>0:40:40.0 Rhiannon: Yes, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:40:40.5 Michael: God.</p>
                        <p>0:40:40.7 Rhiannon: And we're in need of tort reform and...</p>
                        <p>0:40:42.2 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:40:43.3 Rhiannon: Yeah, right.</p>
                        <p>0:40:44.1 Peter: That is based on an orchestrated PR effort by the right. They latch on to specific lawsuits, distort the facts to make them seem more frivolous than they are, and use them to promote the idea that litigation in this country is out of control. They did it...</p>
                        <p>0:40:57.7 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:40:57.9 Peter: Maybe most famously with the McDonald's hot coffee lawsuit, which was, when you look into the details, an incredibly legitimate case that still stood out in the popular consciousness for decades as sort of the exemplar of frivolous litigation. There's also this famous story, which you've probably heard in some form or another, of the burglar who fell through a skylight and sues for his injury.</p>
                        <p>0:41:21.6 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:41:22.6 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:41:22.7 Peter: That occurred in the early '80s. It was substantially more nuanced than it first sounds. There was a kid on the roof of his high school, fell through and these windows that were just... I think they were like painted on, literally. So, it's just some nonsense. They were very poorly maintained windows that should have been maintained better legally, and the school settled for money. This is still being used 40 years later to promote the idea that lawsuits in this country are out of control.</p>
                        <p>0:41:48.9 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:41:49.3 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:41:49.7 Peter: So what conservatives have done, is promulgate and leverage this idea of an overly litigious society to suppress one of the only avenues of redress that ordinary people have against powerful interests. To corporations, lawsuits are just part of the balance sheet. They're a financial nuisance. For a lot of people though, they're the only way to obtain some justice, to recover what they've lost.</p>
                        <p>0:42:13.5 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:42:13.9 Peter: But conservatives on the court treat that as if it's just petty, as if every lawsuit is simply a business transaction, because if you spent your career representing powerful interests, that is all you've ever understood lawsuits to be.</p>
                        <p>0:42:26.4 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:42:26.7 Peter: That's the disconnect that can't be repaired. Their idea of what is fair will always be tainted by the power they hold, that's why they can sneer at the plate of Javaid Iqbal, who was tortured by the federal government because of his race and religion, and at the same time, express this deep concern for the desire of the government and big business to operate as smoothly as they would like to operate.</p>
                        <p>0:42:49.0 Rhiannon: Yeah, you know something that that connects to, too, is another idea we've talked a lot about on the pod, which is that the conservatives couched these decisions as purely procedural decisions, not substantive, this isn't about this person's rights, this isn't about vindicating somebody who has been harmed. This is just procedure, sorry. And I've just been really moved by learning more about Mr. Iqbal's story and finding those facts that were not included in the opinion. It just reminds me that procedural decisions really contribute to shaping broader narratives that ultimately influence substantive rights. So when you hold as the Supreme Court, that pleadings have to be plausible and that Mr. Iqbal's pleadings here are not plausible, they're not specific enough, what you're saying is that this discrimination on the basis of race and religion by high ranking officials in the US government is implausible. It's just not believable.</p>
                        <p>0:43:45.0 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:43:45.3 Rhiannon: And that contributes to broad understandings of what happened, whether people's rights were violated, what it is people can be upset at the government for, all of that. It legitimizes the government practices that were at issue. And for the thousands of Muslims who were interrogated or questioned or detained across the US after 9/11, many without cause or connection to any terrorism allegations, that's a really big deal. What the Supreme Court says and does, it's incorporated into legal canon, often uncritically so, and this means that the narrative of what this case is about, a narrative that minimizes racist violence perpetrated by the government, that narrative is perpetuated in legal practice across the country now.</p>
                        <p>0:44:27.8 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:44:28.5 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:44:29.9 Peter: Next week... [chuckle] So, I don't think this episode would be complete if we didn't check in on the Trump campaign's tiny little coup.</p>
                        <p>0:44:41.7 Michael: Ongoing soft coup.</p>
                        <p>0:44:43.2 Peter: Little baby coup going on. We've got a few things happening. Rudy Giuliani's humiliation in the Pennsylvania case, the sort of potential for some electoral college shenanigans and the Sidney Powell complaint in Georgia, all of it looking very, very pathetic in my view.</p>
                        <p>0:45:04.8 Michael: Right. You may have thought the coup was off when they started to formally recognize the Joe Biden transition, but the coup is still on and still pathetic.</p>
                        <p>0:45:13.9 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right. Still a joke.</p>
                        <p>0:45:17.6 Peter: Yeah. It's been an interesting couple of weeks. We've had quite a bit of flailing on the part of the Trump campaign. Rudy Giuliani just absolutely tanking what was left of his career. At this point, like 50-50 shot he just gets too far when this is all done.</p>
                        <p>0:45:36.0 Rhiannon: You can't even do fascism, bro?</p>
                        <p>0:45:37.8 Peter: It was very embarrassing. His performance at oral argument, just the stuff of legends. One of the worst performances you're gonna hear, out of an attorney that has that kind of experience. Sidney Powell, the Trump campaign distanced themselves from her, and then she filed... I shouldn't even say one of... The worst complaints I have ever read in my life, in Georgia. Spelled the name of the court wrong multiple times in the header, which should be a copy and paste situation for most attorneys. And then, it was literally just like a conspiracy theory Facebook post except like extrapolated out to 100 pages. Just one of the wildest things I've ever read. Nothing even resembling a real solid complaint.</p>
                        <p>0:46:23.9 Rhiannon: No.</p>
                        <p>0:46:24.4 Michael: It also looked like parts of it were copy pasted off like a website or something. Where like the formatting was weird. So one line would have three words with massive spaces between them, and the next line would have 30 words all mushed together in one word, literally just like... And as you can see from the affidavits attached with it... [laughter] Like it's just one long line of words. Very weird. I've never seen anything like that, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:46:52.9 Rhiannon: Listen, when you're vibing, when it's 3:00 AM and you're trying to meet a deadline and you're just vibing, you just gotta let it flow.</p>
                        <p>0:47:00.1 Michael: Yeah, just like... Who needs the fucking space bar? That's for clowns.</p>
                        <p>0:47:03.7 Peter: Yeah, and the only evidence, by the way, they didn't attach a lot of real evidence to the complaint. The only evidence they attached were affidavits, which are just sworn statements by people. So just like random fucking morons who were like they're poll watchers being like, "Yeah, I saw some shady stuff when I was watching the polls. You can read the affidavits." And none of them seem to come close to concrete allegations that make sense. Most of them involve what is clearly a hyperbole. They all say like, "All of the ballots were tainted," and stuff that's just like not something that I would describe as a factual statement. All of this extra funny, mostly because, if you've been deep in the right-wing hive mind ever since the election, which I have been, one of the big themes was like, "Look, this all seems like it's not going well now, but wait until Sidney and Rudy really get going."</p>
                        <p>0:48:00.1 Michael: The secret evidence.</p>
                        <p>0:48:01.4 Peter: When they drop their case, you'll see, and the tides are gonna turn. And these fucking just like wine and Xanax addled morons, just toss a bunch of papers at the court and they're like, "Here it is." [laughter] And that's it. And it's just the most incoherent bullshit you've ever seen. It's a pleasure to watch, I gotta say.</p>
                        <p>0:48:28.2 Rhiannon: You know, it's a basic and kind of short thing that as a lawyer you're taught, but you see in circumstances like this, like how important it actually is. The party that makes it kind of easier for the judge to do what they're asking for, is going to win. But they can't even do that because their pleading's on their face, it's just a mess.</p>
                        <p>0:48:50.6 Peter: Yeah, and maybe... 'Cause this is our Iqbal case, and maybe it's worth noting, the Giuliani case, which at the time of recording, has been dismissed by the Third Circuit, and it might go to the Supreme Court, that's a case about the pleadings, about the specificity of the pleadings and whether they have alleged something plausible. So I think the funniest outcome here is that the Supreme Court overturns Iqbal, just so that Rudy Giuliani can win. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:49:16.9 Michael: It would be incredible.</p>
                        <p>0:49:18.6 Peter: It would.</p>
                        <p>0:49:19.2 Michael: I do wanna note that in Pennsylvania, at the time of this recording at least, the next phase, if you can't get relief from the court is like what we discussed in our episode on the Electoral College, like state legislatures just appointing electors or trying to, at the very least. And there's some indication in Pennsylvania that they might do that. Senator Doug Mastriano tweeted that he was going to introduce a bill for them to appoint their own slate of electors. To highlight how much this is a clown show as well, he tweeted that there were some numbers posted on the Department of State dashboard that have since been deleted, showing Pennsylvania official votes that would show Donald Trump winning the election and only 2.5 million mail ballots being mailed out. And he says, "Well, like Joe Biden, supposedly there were like three million mail ballots in the general election tally, and so clearly, there are all these votes being manufactured out of thin air." The issue being that he tweeted numbers from the primaries.</p>
                        <p>0:50:30.1 Rhiannon: Beautiful. Beautiful.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:50:36.0 Michael: This is precisely this sort of how disconnected from reality it is, but at least at the time of this recording, it does seem like they're going full steam ahead, they don't care.</p>
                        <p>0:50:45.7 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:50:46.2 Peter: Yeah, I mean, they need it to pass the state legislature, which my guess is, would be a tough hurdle.</p>
                        <p>0:50:53.3 Michael: I don't think this is gonna happen. I think this will fizzle out just like the court cases have.</p>
                        <p>0:50:57.1 Peter: If they did, though... I mean, if it passed the state legislature, then all of a sudden, we have a very interesting issue. I just don't think it gets there.</p>
                        <p>0:51:03.8 Michael: Right. Can the governor even veto it? That would be a Supreme Court case, I think.</p>
                        <p>0:51:09.0 Peter: Yeah, that would be a Supreme Court case, and I think the legislature wins, just sort of eye-balling it. It would depend on what exactly the arguments are, but based on my understanding of their understanding of the Constitution, it feels like something the Republican state legislature would win. I don't think we'll get there, but...</p>
                        <p>0:51:27.4 Michael: There are a number of judges who've said specifically, they think they hold a special place in a constitutional order on this stuff. And then we would get into madness. It's not really clear under the law what happens when there are two slates of electors.</p>
                        <p>0:51:42.1 Peter: It would be extremely funny to me if this goes to the Supreme Court and there's just this massive constitutional crisis, but at the end of the day, Joe Biden has 286 electoral college voters, just like...</p>
                        <p>0:51:53.3 Rhiannon: Right, it's like for what?</p>
                        <p>0:51:56.0 Michael: Yeah, I don't see this happening in enough states. It does also highlight another point I wanna make, which is after our last episode, we got a lot of comments from people who thought we are a little too blithely optimistic, actually. A more cynical take on the court than us, which is surprising, of course. And how do we square this? How do we square the idea that we always say it's all politics at bottom and it's about the exercise of power with sort of just assuming the courts are gonna toss all these cases out and laughing about it? And a point I wanna make on that goes back to our very first episode, when we discussed why we wanted to do this. And I think all three of us said... At the very least, I know I said, and I'm pretty sure Rhi did, that we felt the court puts up a facade. A facade that gives it legitimacy. Part of that is like the way they format their opinions and the citations that make them opaque and impenetrable to lay people and give them an air of legitimacy. And we felt like we had to do something like this in order to strip away that facade, so people can see the brute power that underlies it.</p>
                        <p>0:53:13.8 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:53:14.5 Michael: You wouldn't need an hour-long 5-4 episode. You wouldn't need a season of Fiasco to understand that the Supreme Court giving Donald Trump this election is a raw exercise of power. It would fully de-legitimize the entire 40-year project of the federal society. It would be done. There would be nothing left. And again, it's not even clear that they would still be able to do this, even if the court ruled that way, you'd still have to have Congress counting the electoral votes and there would be riots and violence, and it's totally antithetical to their purpose. What they're trying to do here is do this under the cover of law.</p>
                        <p>0:53:57.8 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:53:58.4 Peter: Right, I think one thing that sometimes people don't get is, cynicism doesn't always mean the worst thing happens. Think about the ways in which power intersects with the law and the practice of law, and think about what the most likely scenarios are. And in this case, it is very, very unlikely that you see something like state legislatures rising up for the cause of Donald Trump. Even if you have these nutjob true believers all throughout their ranks, it's just not something that makes sense for the Republican Party as a whole, for the courts, etcetera, and that's why we are optimistic, if you can use that word to describe us in any real sense.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <div>
                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We'll hear argument first this morning in case 10-238, Arizona Free Enterprise Club Freedom Club PAC versus Bennett and the consolidated case.</p>
                        <p>00:12 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about a campaign finance case you probably haven't heard of: Arizona Free Enterprise Club PAC v. Bennett. In 2011, the Supreme Court struck down an Arizona program that provided matching funds for political candidates who opted out of private fundraising. The ruling effectively killed publicly-funded campaigning.</p>
                        <p>00:39 [Archival]: When elected officials are beholden to big donors, they may act to serve those special interests. By supplanting private cash in elections, public financing eliminates the source of political corruption.</p>
                        <p>00:58 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:03 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have infiltrated American life like an invasive species. I am Peter. I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:19 Rhiannon: Hi, there.</p>
                        <p>01:21 Peter: And today's case is Arizona Free Enterprise Club v. Bennett. We're coming off a spate of election-related episodes, and it's been a while since we just sort of did a case. We want to try to return to normal in the hopes that doing so will distract you from the ongoing soft coup, which we'll talk about a little bit at the bottom of this episode.</p>
                        <p>01:42 Rhiannon: The incompetent coup.</p>
                        <p>01:44 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:44 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:46 Peter: So let's talk about some fun election facts, 'cause this case, it is sort of about the election. It is estimated that the aggregate spending on this election was about $14 billion.</p>
                        <p>01:57 Rhiannon: Jesus!</p>
                        <p>01:58 Michael: Jesus!</p>
                        <p>01:58 Peter: Which is a twice 2016, more than the last two presidential election cycles combined.</p>
                        <p>02:04 Rhiannon: That's wild.</p>
                        <p>02:05 Peter: Also, apparently, $3 billion or so of that came in the last few weeks and was driven at least in part by the campaign-related fights over Amy Coney Barrett's nomination. Maybe those numbers set the vibe here. This case is a tale about the lengths the Supreme Court will go to ensure that our Constitution doesn't just operate to the benefit of the wealthy and powerful, but does so in a way that expressly excludes the weak and marginalized. Seeing as we just had an election and the world's biggest idiots are talking about how it was unfair to them, we thought we might talk about one of the many ways in which it actually was unfair.</p>
                        <p>02:45 Peter: We've done episodes on cases like Buckley v. Valeo, which established that money is speech, and Citizens United, which protected the ability of corporations to spend endlessly on campaigns, but this is a story about how some states tried to stem the influence of big money in elections, and how the Supreme Court stepped in to make sure they didn't. So in 1998, the state of Arizona, seeing how big money in elections was becoming a problem, came up with a pretty novel solution. If a wealthy candidate was spending big money in an election, the state itself would provide matching public funds to their opponent, as long as the opponent was garnering sufficient support. That would ensure that wealthy candidates could not drown out the voices of their opponents. It sounds cool enough, right? It seems pretty reasonable.</p>
                        <p>03:36 Michael: That's smart, creative.</p>
                        <p>03:38 Peter: But in this case, the Supreme Court struck that law down, claiming that it somehow infringed the First Amendment rights of the wealthier, private-financed candidates. Essentially, the Court held that the state funding other candidates was watering down the speech of the wealthier candidates. And by the way, the Court refers to the candidates as privately-financed, but I will just be calling them the rich candidates from here on in.</p>
                        <p>04:03 Michael: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>04:04 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, I think that's perfect.</p>
                        <p>04:05 Peter: We're talking about candidates that have access to money, their own bank-rolling of their own campaigns, or it might be. PAC funding or whatever. But regardless, these are either people that are rich or representing the interests of rich people.</p>
                        <p>04:18 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>04:19 Peter: I think that this case is more egregious than Citizens United, and when I say that I'm serious, but I don't mean that its impact is more egregious. What I mean is that this case is just transparently the Court granting favor to the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. It's hard to believe that it's real. It is symbolic and symptomatic of the same anti-democratic tendencies of the Court that have marched us to the precipice of fascism, which we are very much teetering on at this very moment. So Rhi, give us a little background here. How did we get here?</p>
                        <p>04:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah. Peter, you've touched on it already, but this case, I think is particularly relevant in this moment, because we just experienced an election, actually not past tense, it's fucking ongoing. We are experiencing an election that had more fundraising and spending than any other election in history, like you said.</p>
                        <p>05:11 Michael: I feel like prior to this year, we'd say we held an election or we're in the middle of an election, but experiencing an election feels like it captures the trauma of this one accurately. It's the right way to describe it. It's like we are experiencing the 2020 election in our full bodies.</p>
                        <p>05:30 Rhiannon: This is happening to us.</p>
                        <p>05:31 Michael: Yeah, it's something that is being put upon us in a way that we feel at a very fundamental level.</p>
                        <p>05:39 Rhiannon: Totally. Right. Something to highlight even within those massive numbers is that the spending in this election cycle was really unprecedented, specifically in the Presidential contest, which is expected by the end of all of this, to see over $6 billion in total spending alone, that's up from $2.4 billion in the 2016 race.</p>
                        <p>06:03 Michael: Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>06:04 Rhiannon: Yeah, so we're going to say it over and over on this podcast, and this is actually an obvious problem that people on both the left and the right want to fix, and so someone should really do something about this. But when states or Congress try to rein in this poisonous shit, the Supreme Court says, psych, we're not going to do that. So, moving to Arizona and this case specifically, and first of all, Arizona is a weird state, I'm just going to say it. My understanding is that the climate there makes it uninhabitable and yet people still habitate it.</p>
                        <p>06:39 Peter: Yeah, I believe it was Peggy Hill on King of the Hill, who described Phoenix as a monument to man's arrogance.</p>
                        <p>06:46 Rhiannon: That's right, yeah. And don't DM me on Twitter about how living in the desert is great and cool.</p>
                        <p>06:51 Peter: No, it's awful.</p>
                        <p>06:52 Rhiannon: Yeah, you're not supposed to be living there.</p>
                        <p>06:53 Peter: Those places, they're just funneling in water from inhabitable parts of the country, right?</p>
                        <p>07:00 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:00 Peter: It's like Las Vegas.</p>
                        <p>07:01 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>07:02 Peter: If you stopped shipping water to Las Vegas from other parts of the country, everyone there would die within three days.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:10 Rhiannon: Exactly, you're not supposed to have a manicured lawn, Scottsdale. So the good people of Arizona, after a string of political scandals throughout the '80s and '90s, including multiple governors being criminally indicted or impeached or recalled from office, or actually all of the above, shout out to this guy, Mecham, who appears to have been the Governor of Arizona for like five minutes before he became the first US Governor to ever face removal from office, simultaneously through a criminal indictment, an impeachment and a scheduled recall election.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:51 Peter: Hell, yes.</p>
                        <p>07:53 Michael: That guy... incredible levels of corrupted.</p>
                        <p>07:57 Rhiannon: Right. So after dealing with all of this bullshit, citizens of Arizona passed the Citizens Clean Elections Act in 1998. And the purpose of the act, according to its language, was to restore citizen participation and confidence in the political system, to improve the integrity of Arizona State Government and to promote freedom of speech. Now, the act did that by establishing a sort of a new system for voter education, clean funding for candidate campaigns, and also setting up mechanisms for campaign finance enforcement. The most important provision of the Act for our purposes today was providing public funding for legislative and statewide candidates who opted into this public financing system. And if you opted in to get public funds, you give up private fundraising. In addition, there was a unique aspect of the public funding of campaigns that sought to make campaign spending schemes more fair in Arizona.</p>
                        <p>08:58 Rhiannon: So if a candidate opted in to have their campaign publicly funded, the law contained a provision for triggered matching funds, which would be distributed to the publicly-funded candidates, if they had an opponent who was rich and privately financing their own campaign and who spent over a threshold trigger amount in that campaign. So say that you're a candidate for office in Arizona and you opt in to have your campaign publicly-funded. There are some conditions, like giving up private fundraising, like I mentioned, but also that you participate in a certain number of public debates, that you limit your expenditure of personal funds in your own campaign, you agree to adhere to an overall spending cap.</p>
                        <p>09:38 Rhiannon: These are things that the people of Arizona said they wanted to clean up the campaign and election process in their state. And so to just give an example of how the matching funds provision works, imagine that as a publicly-funded candidate, you get $10,000 from the state to run your campaign. It wasn't $10,000 in real life, but just so we have a kind of round number. So you get $10,000 from the state to run your campaign. If your opponent was a privately-funded, read rich person, who did not agree to public funding, then for every dollar the rich person candidate spent on their campaign over that $10,000, you'd get a dollar from the state to spend on your campaign. So they match that amount. For purposes of calculating the total sum that rich candidates were spending in their campaigns, the law included spending by independent expenditure organizations too. So the state gives you $10,000 and maybe the privately-funded, the rich candidate might spend $10,000 of their own, but if expenditures by an independent group in support of the rich candidate was like another $10,000, then you, as the publicly-funded candidate would get matched those funds also.</p>
                        <p>10:51 Michael: Right, so I just want to say really quick why this is important. Public funding is basically dead at this point, and a big reason is because you can just raise more money privately. So this sort of sought to address that concern. The idea was, "Well, look, like, if we just set a number like $20,000 or $50,000, privately-funded candidates are going to out-raise that, and so nobody's going to want to go into the public system, but if we set it an obscenely large number like $3 million, yeah, nobody's going to out-raise that, but we as the state are going to be on the hook for an obscenely large amount of money for all these elections." And so this was a creative and elegant way of meeting that challenge, saying, "Well, we'll you a baseline amount of money, but then if the race is more expensive, if being competitive in the race costs more than that, we'll give you some more money so that you can be competitive."</p>
                        <p>11:51 Rhiannon: Right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>11:51 Michael: And so that there isn't a major drawback to taking public funds. And this is a way to encourage people to take public funds and ignore private funding altogether and engage in a more corruption-free form of campaigning, free of the influence of monied interests.</p>
                        <p>12:09 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>12:10 Michael: Obviously, as we'll discuss, the Supreme Court did not like that one bit.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:14 Rhiannon: Yeah, so petitioners in this case, the people who brought the suit, were five past and future candidates for office in Arizona, as well as two independent expenditure groups. And what they're saying is that this matching funds provision of the law was unconstitutional because it penalized their speech and it burdened their ability to exercise their First Amendment rights. Now, Peter, you get to talk about the law.</p>
                        <p>12:42 Peter: Yeah, yeah, so this is a free speech case, and so we should talk about the relevant free speech law here. It's pretty much uncontested at this point that campaign spending is speech, so that's not the issue before the Court here. The issue is whether the State of Arizona providing matching funds to the non-wealthy candidates somehow burdens the free speech of the wealthy candidates, and the Court in a 5-4 decision, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts...</p>
                        <p>13:13 Michael: Pod favorite.</p>
                        <p>13:14 Peter: Says that, yes, it does, in a decision that is almost devoid of any meaningful analysis. So the Court starts off by saying that this matching funds law "imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises his First Amendment rights." And I was waiting with baited breath. Like, okay, what's the penalty? So the law doesn't limit how much a wealthy candidate or a PAC spends it all, it just provides matching campaign funds to other candidates, so how does that penalize anyone? And when I tell you that the Court never really answers that question, I'm not lying. Robert says, "the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech," to describe like rich people funding their campaigns, and he's like, when they do that, when they vigorously exercise their right to use personal funds, that leads to advantages for opponents because then the state provides matching funds, and it's like, okay.</p>
                        <p>14:18 Rhiannon: This is so stupid.</p>
                        <p>14:22 Michael: You're penalized by not being able to drown out your opponent.</p>
                        <p>14:25 Peter: Right. Yeah, so that might "penalize" the rich guy in the sense that it makes his campaign harder to win, but winning your election is not guaranteed under the First Amendment. The Court's primary argument is basically, well, this isn't fair. Which is a matter of opinion, but has very, very little to do with whether it is legal, which is the question the Court is supposed to be answering. The question isn't just generally, well, this doesn't seem fair. These other people are getting in the money from the government. The question is, does that violate the First Amendment.</p>
                        <p>14:58 Michael: Right. And I think you're right, that Roberts' opinion sort of is infused with this idea that this isn't fair, but he phrases it differently, they use fairness derogatorily later on. And I think that ties back into other cases we've discussed, like Rucho, which was the gerrymandering case, where the entire opinion seemed to be like, look, politics isn't always fair and elections aren't always played cleanly and all that, but all they're really doing is re-casting their ideas of fairness as constitutional, it's not fair that when I spend more money, my opponent also gets more money. So that's a burden. Your concerns are "fairness concerns," my concerns are constitutional burdens, that's how they frame this and it's just transparent bullshit. It is.</p>
                        <p>15:55 Rhiannon: Yeah. Yeah, and to just underscore Roberts using fair in sort of a derogatory way, there's a quote where he says "leveling the playing field can sound like a good thing, but in a democracy, campaigning for office is not a game. The First Amendment embodies our choice as a nation, that when it comes to such speech, the guiding principle is freedom, not whatever the state may view as fair." Okay, you're deciding what is fair, this is your idea of fair, it's your opinion.</p>
                        <p>16:26 Peter: Well, he's also deciding what freedom means, right?</p>
                        <p>16:30 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>16:31 Michael: Right. At no point does this law prohibit anyone from spending any money of their own on their own campaign or somebody else's.</p>
                        <p>16:39 Peter: That's the fundamental issue. The question is supposed to be whether this burdens the speech of the rich guy spending his money. He still gets to spend as much as he wants, spread his message, as much as he wants, that's his speech. It's not inhibited at all. There's no restriction on his spending, on his ads, on the content of his speech, absolutely no restriction on his ability to get his message out. All this does is allow other candidates to spread their message as well. An analogy would be like if I said I have a First Amendment right to hold up a sign, and also no one should be allowed to hold up a sign near mine because that would take attention away from me, right? To make the analogy more accurate and get the government involved, if I get a permit to hold a protest and my political opponents get a permit to counter protest nearby, which happens all the time, can I claim that they are burdening my freedom of speech, and therefore shouldn't have been granted a permit?</p>
                        <p>17:31 Peter: It's the same logic. Any judge would laugh at the idea that your speech is somehow burdened by the mere presence of someone else's speech nearby, but here is the Supreme Court treating that idea as if it's common sense. It's fucking crazy.</p>
                        <p>17:46 Rhiannon: Yeah, it absolutely is. And Michael sort of touched on with a matching funds program really embodied earlier in the episode, the way I think about this is it's an incentive program. Arizona wanted to clean up election spending in campaigning because they had experienced what happens when this stuff is played dirty and wealthy people have too much influence over campaigns, and so they're incentivizing public funding. If you agree to some clean campaign conditions, we will give you the money to run your campaign. That's good for voters in Arizona and the political process. And if you don't do that, well, the more and more money you spend, it's going to be matched and given to your public-funded opponent, so consider carefully what amount you're spending and what you're spending it on. This is encouraging good governance and accountability in campaign finance, it's encouraging people to opt in to a public-funded program, it's like inexplicably so stupid and absurd to say that somehow that's actually unfair for rich people.</p>
                        <p>18:49 Peter: The dissent argued something that I think is pretty obvious, they're like, doesn't this just increase overall speech, we're giving funds to opposing candidates, which results in more ideas being shared and more overall public debate, like that's promoting speech, that's not inhibiting speech. And the Court's like, well, yeah, maybe, but that doesn't matter because you are still burdening speech of the "privately-financed" candidate, but again, the Court just fails to articulate how one person's speech is penalized by the presence of another person's speech. And I'll keep coming back to that because it is central to the case and it's never adequately addressed, never once in the opinion does Roberts clearly state why that is true, it's just sort of assumed throughout.</p>
                        <p>19:33 Peter: And this brought us to a discussion we had when we were discussing this case, which is like I feel like Roberts is sort of dumb in a way that he doesn't eat a lot of flak for. Obviously, he's very savvy in some ways, he's a consensus builder, he appears to be talented at that, but I think because of that, people have given him credit for being sharp in general, and he actually has some of the weakest opinions of the conservative bunch just from a pure legal reasoning, legal analysis perspective.</p>
                        <p>20:02 Peter: We talked in Shelby County about how he never explained what the Court's constitutional basis for interfering with the Voting Rights Act actually was, and then we have the same problem here where he's just never laying out the central premise of the case. This is the sort of opposite of what Clarence Thomas does. Roberts gets a lot of credit for taking more moderate positions every now and then, too much credit, of course, we believe, but he actually can't articulate his positions effectively at all. The opposite of that is someone like Clarence Thomas, who takes insanely radical positions constantly, but is actually pretty good at laying out the sort of internal logical consistency.</p>
                        <p>20:36 Rhiannon: Right. There's a legal framework that you can track when Thomas is right.</p>
                        <p>20:39 Michael: There's a clarity of thought and writing that sort of shines through and it's very forceful and it can be persuasive.</p>
                        <p>20:46 Peter: Yeah, and it flows from insane premises, but it still flows. So the Court then goes on to talk about how the government does not have an interest in "leveling the playing field" between different types of speech, which is something we mentioned earlier. This is something that conservatives on the Court have long held. They say like, look, it's not the government's responsibility to make sure that speech is fair, which is a very convenient position to take if you are looking to justify the fact that wealthy interests have access to vastly speech than everyone else.</p>
                        <p>21:17 Rhiannon: Exactly, and Justice Kagan points out in her dissent that the citizens of the state of Arizona have a strong interest in preventing wealthy donors from controlling their government by proxy, and this law was designed exactly to fight against that. And that reasoning is really compelling, but it just doesn't fly with conservatives. 'cause they don't give a shit.</p>
                        <p>21:39 Peter: Yeah, a core part of the conservative philosophy, and maybe the central part of conservative philosophy, as we've discussed before, is the idea that people generally deserve their lot in life. The wealthy have earned their wealth, the poor have failed to achieve and therefore deserve their poverty. The idea that it's unfair to purchase influence just does not comport with the conservative brain, because to them, those outcomes are inherently fair. They believe that the wealthy deserve to enjoy the fruits of their hard-earned wealth, and that includes influence over the government, it's as simple and twisted as that. Like you will never be able to convince them that the powerful should not be powerful, because that premise is the very core of conservatism.</p>
                        <p>22:23 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>22:24 Michael: Right. And I think we've hit on the ways this is like pro-wealthy very clearly and I think that's good, but I do want to highlight that it's not just in favor of Republican donors. It's also very anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic. Rhi mentioned that the citizens passed this, this was an initiative. This was a referenda, it wasn't passed by the Arizona legislature, this was literally passed by the citizens on the ballot. This is a popular legislation in the most pure sense of the word, in response to real documented ongoing corruption concerns.</p>
                        <p>23:05 Michael: And you have the Supreme Court stepping in saying, well, you gotta fucking live with the corruption, you don't get to decide, people of Arizona, how fair your elections are, you don't get to make these decisions, we do. It's transparently anti-majoritarian, and it ties into the larger Republican anti-majoritarian project in that way. I think it's important to think about it from that perspective as well, and remember that there's a real disdain here for the voting public.</p>
                        <p>23:37 Peter: Absolutely. I think it's worth noting, like when you take a step back here, what's happening. People within Arizona, average citizens, are saying, okay, corporations, rich people, whoever, have too much control and influence over our government, so let us pool our money together to combat that influence.</p>
                        <p>23:57 Rhiannon: Yeah, we'll pony up the funds.</p>
                        <p>24:00 Peter: How do we do that? Through the most natural vessel, the government, the public financing system.</p>
                        <p>24:05 Michael: Our tax dollars.</p>
                        <p>24:06 Peter: Right. And the Court is saying, no, you're not allowed to do that, you're not allowed to all agree, by referendum, to pool your funds to combat that. That is fucking crazy. And by the way, not once are the speech implications for that voting public referenced in this opinion, not once.</p>
                        <p>24:22 Michael: No, no.</p>
                        <p>24:24 Rhiannon: A glaring omission, for sure.</p>
                        <p>24:26 Michael: Yeah. I think it is important to note that the Justices are sort of just doing what they want here, this is a bare assertion of their policy preferences. As much as they want to act like they are bound by precedent in all this, the First Amendment at its inception, was very limited, and our earliest presidents were jailing newspapermen and political opponents for criticizing them. And you had Supreme Court Justices saying that was totally constitutional and above board. And the ideas that now sort infuse our First Amendment jurisprudence are all sort of 20th century inventions of the Supreme Court. And I think that's a good thing, but it's important to sort of remember that the Court here is sort of on its own, doing its own policymaking, and the First Amendment, more so than pretty much any other area, and the campaign finance environment that we live in should be properly understood as the Court's creation.</p>
                        <p>25:28 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>25:29 Michael: We have time and time again seen Congress trying to rein in campaign spending decade after decade after decade in cases we've discussed and the courts striking it down and picking and choosing what they think is okay and what is not. And so if you think campaign finance is broken and if you think money in politics is disgusting and all our politicians are corrupt, the people to thank are the Supreme Court Justices. Period.</p>
                        <p>25:57 Rhiannon: That's right here. Oh, guys, I had a really important thing to say. We need to go to an ad.</p>
                        <p>26:05 Peter: So we've complained about the Court's speech doctrine before, but it bears repeating. These doctrines are layers and layers of precedent that don't make sense. First, you have the idea that money is speech. You have the idea that governments can't "level the playing field." You have the idea that money and politics does not lead to corruption, which is established in Citizens United. All of those things are bizarre and detached from reality, but they're all settled precedent when this case is being decided in 2011. And at that point, you're talking about something that is so distant from what actual speech is, that the boundaries of the doctrine become very hazy and unclear, and that sort of a gray area gives conservatives the wiggle room to hold that somehow not only can candidates and corporations and whoever spend as much as they want, but public financing that helps balance that out is illegal.</p>
                        <p>27:00 Michael: Right, and I think this opinion sort of drives home how abstract and disconnected these discussions are, because this wasn't enacted in a vacuum. This was enacted in response to real documented corruption that was taking place in the presence of federal campaign finance laws, pre-existing campaign finance laws and spending caps and all the stuff that the Supreme Court has already said was okay. This was in response to corruption surviving despite those limits, and instead of an engagement with that reality, what you have are these citations to cases where they cite Citizens United, and they're like, "As we held in Citizens United, independent expenditures cannot be corruption or create the appearance of corruption."</p>
                        <p>27:47 Michael: That's not a legal determination. That's like saying, "As we held in Citizens United, the world is flat." Either they can or they can't, but you don't get to hold that. If somebody accepts a quid pro quo from independent expenditures, it happened, whether or not you intoned that it cannot. But they want to make this so abstract because they know the second you get into the facts, there's no, no justifying their position here at all, because it's blatantly obvious what's going on, why people are spending $14 billion on federal elections. They're not doing that because they expect to get nothing in return.</p>
                        <p>28:27 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly. Reading these cases, reading Roberts' writing in particular on this stuff, it's sometimes hard to discern whether they actually believe this bullshit that they're saying and writing. John Roberts is either straight up lying or he lives on a completely different planet and is deeply disconnected from the reality of how our alleged democracy works. Both of those are really concerning, right? Like the Chief Justice lying to us about how this works, or the Chief Justice completely not understanding how this works in real life.</p>
                        <p>29:02 Rhiannon: There's a quote later on that gets, I think, Peter, to your point about how abstracted this discussion is and these concepts are in a way that just builds on their assumed premises from precedent, from shitty precedent. Roberts writes, "This sort of beggar thy neighbor approach to free speech, restricting the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others, is wholly foreign to the First Amendment." So that's stupid and incorrect, but what's he actually talking about right now? You're not even talking about speech, you're talking about fucking money. That's what you're talking about, but because y'all held a few years before this that money is speech, then you get to these even more absurd conclusions.</p>
                        <p>29:50 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:51 Michael: Right. And because you've assumed that somebody else speaking is a restriction, you can say, here's somebody who is not being restricted in spending at all, and that somehow has been converted into their speech being restricted.</p>
                        <p>30:06 Peter: Yeah, I mean, what they really mean when they say this is, like, interfering with or restricting the wealthy candidate's speech, what they really mean is like you are interfering with the natural order. There is a hierarchy that exists and you are fucking with it. There's this idea called the just world fallacy or the just world hypothesis or something. It's a bias held by people where you believe that people reap the just rewards for their actions. So if someone acts in a good or noble manner, they will be rewarded, and if they act in a evil or negative manner, they will be punished. That's the fallacy, and I feel like conservatism sometimes is just that fallacy extrapolated to all of human existence, and that just explains 95% of conservative positions.</p>
                        <p>30:50 Rhiannon: Right. And how illogical it is with how things work in the real world. In the real world, it's okay to have rules about how people do something. There's a rule in soccer about not being off sides, not passing to a player who is off sides, and there's a reason why we have that rule, right? It prevents you from cherry-picking, from having an unfair advantage. It forces you to meet an opponent and win. You earn your goal, right? And everybody accepts restrictions and rules on daily life because it makes things more fair. Here, what they're saying is the First Amendment gives you a right to just unrestricted speech, and since speech is money, if you have unrestricted money, you got all the speech in the world, right?</p>
                        <p>31:35 Peter: Now that you've made that analogy, Rhi, I am 100% positive that there's a Federalist Society dipshit somewhere who has written an article about how the off-sides rule is unfair. [laughter] It penalizes the fastest players.</p>
                        <p>31:49 Rhiannon: We don't like it.</p>
                        <p>31:50 Michael: Right. I do want to say, earlier, I think one of you, I think it was Peter, it may have been Rhiannon, said something about how this opinion says that it's not government's responsibility to make sure that speech is fair. And I think that's a good articulation of the opinion, but I just wanted to make the point that I do think it's the government's responsibility to make sure that elections are fair. I think the foundation of any democracy is a free and fair election, and that's like a pretty uncontroversial idea, and that's what campaign finance laws have been about since the start. And that's what they take umbrage with, the idea of free and fair elections is ultimately what bothers conservatives. The foundation of their electoral project is making sure that elections are as unfree and unfair as possible, and I think that's been never more ably demonstrated than this year.</p>
                        <p>32:45 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:46 Rhiannon: And they couch this in a so-called principled legal stance. Conservatives act like this is the only logical result because we are... Like, "I'm sorry, this is what the First Amendment says." Right? "And y'all can do what you want in your little democracy, but these certain lines are off limits," or whatever, and they make it seem like, well, this is the only thing we can do, we're sorry, our hands are tied because this is what the Constitution says. That ends up being weaponized against people, because what they're not saying is that our most important principle is democracy. There's language in the opinion where they say, well, we're not seating an opinion, Roberts says, on public financing of campaigns. Public financing of campaigns is fine, but after this decision, public financing...</p>
                        <p>33:35 Peter: Public financing of campaigns is fine, you just can't do it.</p>
                        <p>33:38 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>33:39 Michael: In any way that's useful or meaningful.</p>
                        <p>33:44 Peter: If you come up with a way to do it effectively, they will strike it down, that's the basic premise.</p>
                        <p>33:46 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. I wonder what a constitutional public finance scheme would look like after this.</p>
                        <p>33:51 Peter: Using this logic, you could strike down any public financing scheme.</p>
                        <p>33:54 Rhiannon: Exactly, right.</p>
                        <p>33:55 Peter: The end result of this opinion is that the Court is holding functionally, that the First Amendment protects not only your right to speech, but the relative power of your speech. In other words, the First Amendment protects your right to drown out the message of your opponents. When you take a step back, what you have here is a law passed by the citizens of the state directly, allowing those citizens to ensure that they maintain influence over the government, and the Supreme Court steps in to say, no, that's unfair to the powerful interests who are using their hard-earned money to buy that influence. They've taken the First Amendment and essentially held that it gives the wealthy not just a right to speech, but a right to power, and that is self-evidently dangerous and untenable.</p>
                        <p>34:42 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>34:45 Rhiannon: Correct.</p>
                        <p>34:46 Peter: Alright, so we mentioned we would talk a little bit about the soft coup currently currently under way in the United States. As we're recording this, things are sort of still unclear, but it's fairly clear that A, Donald Trump is not able to admit that he has been defeated and will never openly admit it, and B, that the Republican Party is, with some small but notable exceptions, essentially standing behind him, but in a way that's sort of a hedge, right, sort of a, well, let's see how this pans out.</p>
                        <p>35:22 Michael: We don't want to rule out a coup just yet, we're not diving head first either.</p>
                        <p>35:28 Peter: Right. There's going to be recounts in several states. A recount has been ordered in Georgia, which is like in and of itself sort of crazy, because it almost certainly would not have been ordered if not for just the political pressure, like politicians in Georgia very much want to appease the GOP base by acting like they're all in here, right, they're going for it. So the next step here is that the states would certify their electors to the Electoral College, and the question is whether something can be done by the states that were won by Biden, by the legislatures in those states, for example, to either refuse to certify results or try to appoint Republican electors that would actually vote for Trump rather than Biden, despite the fact that Biden has won the state.</p>
                        <p>36:12 Peter: So that's what's sort of hanging in the ether, like the extent to which that could happen, obviously it technically can happen, but whether there's really like they have the political capital and motivation to do it, that's what's sort of outstanding right now. And it's an impossible question to answer, but I think we can say it feels very unlikely. It feels very unlikely. Much more likely than it should, no question about that, but it still feels like we're in a situation where that is a very low probability.</p>
                        <p>36:39 Peter: Now, we mentioned last week that there was a lawsuit in Pennsylvania basically attacking all mail-in ballots. I don't think they're going to get anywhere with that, but they sort of showed what their move might be because what they were asking for in that lawsuit is an injunction preventing the certification of electors in Pennsylvania. They are never going to fucking... If they get that it, it's over.</p>
                        <p>37:03 Michael: Right at the Supreme Court and at every state house.</p>
                        <p>37:06 Peter: Just a campaign saying, well, look, this all looks a little bit shady, this state doesn't count, that's functionally the end of democracy. I don't think they're going to get it. I've had people online like, you really don't think there's five conservatives on the Court that would buy that? No, I don't.</p>
                        <p>37:21 Michael: I don't either.</p>
                        <p>37:21 Peter: I mean, it's genuinely something that might lose 9-0 in the Supreme Court, I wouldn't really guarantee that, but there's a real shot that it would get 9-0, that's how bad it is.</p>
                        <p>37:27 Michael: Yeah, it's a pretty laughable lawsuit. I read it.</p>
                        <p>37:33 Peter: Yeah, it's garbage, it's just garbage. Like we said last time, it has this sort of scope to maybe, at least it's trying to flip Pennsylvania or at least get rid of Pennsylvania, but it's even worse on the merits then all of the other lawsuits. There is still one avenue, which is that the state legislatures that are controlled by Republicans could band together and refuse to certify the election for Joe Biden. I don't think they have the sort of unanimity that is necessary to do it, it doesn't feel like they have, there's already dissent being voiced publicly by Republicans in Pennsylvania, but it is fun. I know you guys are dreading this. I on the other hand am sort of excited because I've been more or less a leftist, at the very least on and off since I was about 15, and when you're a leftist in 2001, trying to explain to people that the United States is a fascist dystopia, everyone's like what the fuck are talking about, you idiot. And here I am, 20 years later, I'm like, see? Now you see, motherfuckers.</p>
                        <p>38:37 Rhiannon: I'm just exhausted. I'm like same, right. But I don't know how...</p>
                        <p>38:41 Peter: But this is energizing me. This is giving me energy.</p>
                        <p>38:44 Michael: I wish our listeners could see us, because Rhi and I are both just like ground into dust by the past few months, and Peter is like, man, I could go for a fucking run, I'm going to clean my apartment, I think. Guys, there's a coup coming, I'm feeling good. He's like shadow boxing.</p>
                        <p>39:03 Rhiannon: And I am breaking out in hives.</p>
                        <p>39:07 Peter: Do not mistake me, I am sleeping five hours a night tops. I feel like garbage. However, yeah, I do have to say that something about the fascism in this country becoming undeniably transparent is sort of refreshing to me in a way that gives me energy. Of course, that'll wear off after a week and I'll be like, well, now you just live in a dictatorship, but I... For now, it feels like I'm winning an argument that I've been having my whole life, you know what I mean?</p>
                        <p>39:39 Michael: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:40 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>39:41 Peter: And what's better than winning an argument, baby?</p>
                        <p>39:44 Rhiannon: The podcaster's creed.</p>
                        <p>39:45 Michael: I cannot wait to tell @Jeet_here to eat shit for saying that we were indecent for wishing Trump to die of COVID. See, motherfucker? It would have been better. I told you.</p>
                        <p>40:00 Peter: That's true. Michael, in our Trump got COVID episode said... He said outright, it'll be smoother if Trump dies, than if the election actually happens. And you've gotta take credit bro, you gotta pat yourself on the back for that one.</p>
                        <p>40:13 Rhiannon: That's why you tune in to 5-4.</p>
                        <p>40:16 Michael: That take nailed it. Fucking nailed it.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>40:21 Peter: So like brass tacks on the coup stuff, certification for electors in most of these states is a late November, early December thing, so as those dates approach, you're going to start to understand one way or another which way it's tilting, and we don't have that insight right now. I still feel like the avenues are very narrow, but a lot of this... People keep asking me, "Can you explain the legal sides of this?" And it's like, this is not about law, this is about the coalescence of power around a position. If every conservative institution, from the media through the Executive Branch to the Federal Congress and state legislatures, takes the position that this election belongs to Trump, that is a very different story than a situation where you only have fractured support across those institutions.</p>
                        <p>41:14 Rhiannon: Right, and it's also a very different story than saying the Constitution allows this. The point is, is that power says what the law is and what the legal conclusions are.</p>
                        <p>41:24 Peter: By the way, even if the state legislatures certify the results either to nobody or to Donald Trump, if that happens, if there is sort of a fight over it, it almost certainly ends up in Congress, and although Democrats don't have a firm grip on Congress, someone like Mitt Romney is not about to throw the election to Trump. Republicans would really struggle to get a majority in the Senate, for example. And I don't think that they think it's worth the fight. We talked about that last time too, is they've done so much damage that it really feels like to some degree they need to step back and say, "Alright, mission accomplished, let Biden enter power," and that will be that.</p>
                        <p>42:00 Michael: And Kelly, in Arizona, I think he already has the temporary senate office and he assumes office soon, since that was a special election. He doesn't have to wait till January. And the Georgia runoffs, those would also be seated the first week of January and would be involved in the electoral count. So I also don't think that the Republican Party wants to make the Georgia runoffs and control of the Senate about whether or not they're going to do a soft coup and seat Donald Trump as President despite losing the election handily, which is what it would very quickly turn into, if this was the route they took, was like, "Look, Democrats need to control the Senate if you want American democracy to continue going forward."</p>
                        <p>42:47 Peter: I think there's a sort of question of just like how far can Trump's stubbornness get him? What if he just holds out, he refuses? I think the answer to that is that just results in him being kicked out of the White House, which is just way too embarrassing for him to tolerate, which is why at some point he's going to voluntarily leave, sort of a Nixonian peace with honor sort of thing, like, "I do not admit defeat, but I admit that everyone else agrees and thinks I was defeated and I'm leaving." Or alternative, if you guys remember the end of Parasite where the dad just stays in the basement of the house, [laughter] and then Donald Trump Jr has the dream about becoming the President himself and freeing Trump from the basement. But then the final shot is a cut to Donald Trump Jr, bleary-eyed on a couch somewhere.</p>
                        <p>43:37 Michael: Like coke spread out in front of him.</p>
                        <p>43:42 Rhiannon: Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>43:49 Peter: Alright, next week, we are taking off 'cause it's Thanksgiving. It's not Thanksgiving on Tuesday, but just let us take a fucking break. For the love of God.</p>
                        <p>43:57 Rhiannon: For once. For once.</p>
                        <p>44:00 Peter: And in very important news...</p>
                        <p>44:02 Rhiannon: So exciting.</p>
                        <p>44:03 Peter: We have launched a merch store.</p>
                        <p>44:06 Rhiannon: Yes!</p>

                        <p>00:03 Speaker 1: Hey, everyone. This is Leon from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael look back at the results of last week's election.</p>
                        <p>00:13 Speaker 2: The people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory.</p>
                        <p>00:20 S1: They scrutinize the complaints of voting irregularities that the Trump campaign has attempted to bring forward since November 3rd.</p>
                        <p>00:26 Speaker 3: Millions and millions of people voted for us tonight and a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people.</p>
                        <p>00:38 S1: They also discuss the state of play in the Senate and what the Democrats failure to achieve a majority means for the prospect of court reform. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>00:54 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have left America flailing and helpless, like an outgoing president who is emotionally incapable of admitting defeat. I am Peter, I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:11 Rhiannon: Hi, good morning, Sunday morning.</p>
                        <p>01:13 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:14 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:17 Peter: Oh man. This is a special episode. The election was a few days ago, it has now been called by every major media organization for Joseph Robinette Biden.</p>
                        <p>01:31 Rhiannon: Robinette.</p>
                        <p>01:32 Peter: And I think I speak for everyone when I say, this was a weird one.</p>
                        <p>01:36 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:36 Michael: Yeah, yes.</p>
                        <p>01:37 Peter: We're a Supreme Court podcast, we're gonna get to the implications for the Court and courts generally in just a few, but first, general reactions. I think for me, in the beginning this felt like a loss. A, the initial results looked bad. He lost Florida immediately.</p>
                        <p>01:53 Rhiannon: Right. Florida being on the East Coast really fucked the vibe of the whole thing because that was coming in early and I just thought we were fucked.</p>
                        <p>01:58 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:00 Michael: Yeah, it really did.</p>
                        <p>02:03 Peter: Right. Even once the results started looking a little better, Biden winning is moderately good news, Trump losing, fantastic news.</p>
                        <p>02:10 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>02:11 Peter: But I think having it be this close, losing seats in the House, not winning the Senate, all of which is very embarrassing, together it adds up to what I think is generally speaking, bad news for the Democrats, and maybe even worse news for the American Left. Without the Senate, McConnell's gonna block everything. No real hope of substantial progressive legislation. And the Dems maybe at high risk of getting wiped out in 2022 and 2024 because they won't have any accomplishments to hang their hat on, and they won't have anti-Trump animists to drive turnout.</p>
                        <p>02:43 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>02:44 Peter: And that was sort of dragging me down but as the days have passed I've been feeling better mostly because we've all gotten to bear witness to the pathetic whining of Donald Trump and his cronies who have never sounded more like losers than they have in the past few days.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>03:01 Michael: Yes, it's hilarious.</p>
                        <p>03:03 Rhiannon: So many dirty diapers.</p>
                        <p>03:06 Peter: All these fucking morons who spent the past four years openly gloating, and wearing the hats, and flying their fucking Trump flags on their 10-year payment plan boats, these people are now exclusively in two camps. Most of them are screaming about widespread fraud without anything really resembling solid evidence, and the rest are sort of shifting to a very somber Gore/Lieberman 2000-style, like calls for counting all the votes which is just mwaah, just fucking incredible. Go fuck yourselves, go fuck yourselves you fucking losers.</p>
                        <p>03:43 Rhiannon: Yeah, either way, I love this song, I'm jamming, too. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:46 Peter: Yeah, it's good.</p>
                        <p>03:47 Michael: Yeah, it's fantastic. It's fantastic.</p>
                        <p>03:50 Peter: I really feel like this is one of the first times, if not the first time in his political career, that Trump's bullshit has really run up against reality in a meaningful way. He can still bullshit, he's still tweeting that he won, but he can't bullshit his way out of it. Barring something really unprecedented, at some point in the next three months, he has to admit to himself that he's gotta pack up his shit and leave.</p>
                        <p>04:14 Michael: Right. World leaders around the globe are just congratulating President-elect Biden. At some point you can't ignore that, it's happening whether or not you want it to.</p>
                        <p>04:24 Rhiannon: Yeah. I heard stuff about the Secret Service, and US marshals and other sort of federal law enforcement.</p>
                        <p>04:30 Michael: Just going about the normal thing?</p>
                        <p>04:32 Rhiannon: Right, going about the normal thing, doing what they usually do in preparation for a presidential transition. But in addition, maybe prepping themselves also to do a little eviction.</p>
                        <p>04:42 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:42 Michael: Oh, really? Awesome.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:45 Peter: If Trump refuses to leave the Oval Office, that's a direct threat to Joe Biden and the Secret Service has to kill him. That's how it goes.</p>
                        <p>04:52 Rhiannon: Right, those are the rules. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:54 Michael: Those are the rules.</p>
                        <p>04:55 Peter: I don't make them.</p>
                        <p>04:56 Rhiannon: How's that for a little procedure, bitch?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:02 Michael: I'm gonna call into the FBI with a hot tip about a plot against the president.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:06 Rhiannon: There's a plot against the president, and it's coming from inside the House. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:14 Michael: In terms of the election week, the real monkey's paw where we talked about how cool it would be to have an election week and then we had an election week and it was truly awful. I'm kind of a data nerd, I taught math at one point in time in my life, in a past life. And so I felt very comfortable about this Tuesday night, when the AP called Arizona, and then certainly Wednesday morning, I was feeling very good. So for this whole week, I think there was this very frustrating divide between me and a lot of my family who were freaking out and who did not have this sense of calm and peace that I did about where this was going inevitably because things seemed very uncertain. And the people to blame for that are, obviously, the Republican Party in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, in Wisconsin who rebuffed efforts to start pre-canvassing mail-in ballots because they thought they would benefit from this period of uncertainty because they thought that that would create the conditions for legal challenges and de-legitimizing mail ballots that while the vote was changing several days after the election, this would be a chance for them to make a case for throwing out mail ballots.</p>
                        <p>06:31 Michael: And we had to live through that stress. And also later on, it was some bullshit from the networks. And I think they should take some heat for that. They sat on this for a long time. Well past the point where their own people on air, were basically saying like, "We haven't called it, but it's pretty much over." Kornacki is sitting there begging the Decision Desk on air, to finally just fucking call Pennsylvania...</p>
                        <p>06:54 Rhiannon: Right. So he could go to sleep.</p>
                        <p>06:55 Michael: Yeah, and it was irresponsible. It was a disservice to its viewers. It's a disservice to the public, and it dragged out this period much longer than it needed to. The explanation was like, "We'll let the conspiracy theorists say that the votes aren't getting counted." And all this shit. The conspiracy theorists are gonna say whatever they want. What we saw happen... It was inevitably what happened once they called it, which is an outpouring of support in normalization of President Elect Biden, from world leaders, from other institutions, things that would normalize the loss and start moving...</p>
                        <p>07:27 Rhiannon: From the streets, yeah.</p>
                        <p>07:29 Michael: Yeah. Start moving us to the next phase. And they delayed that at least 24 hours, probably 36.</p>
                        <p>07:36 Peter: But I'm glad they waited for like a Saturday afternoon, 'cause it was just good vibes.</p>
                        <p>07:40 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>07:40 Rhiannon: Yeah, that way we could really get lit. Yeah, no. I spent the week absolutely way more stressed out than I needed to be, even though I knew those objective realities and objective... Certain eventualities. You guys know. I was checking in with you, because I would be like, "Michael, can you calm me down? Michael, what's gonna happen again? Can you please remind me that it's okay?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:04 Rhiannon: And yeah, I put a lot of that on the media. I don't understand why... I do understand, because it's for ratings, it's for making it look like it's close, it's for making it look stressful, but in terms of the media talking about it like, "Oh, Trump has gained on Biden in this state. Or, Biden just lost a lead in Florida in... " Whatever. "In Arizona, in Georgia." When that's not... There's a total number of votes, it's already there.</p>
                        <p>08:31 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>08:32 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>08:33 Peter: It's not like an actual foot race.</p>
                        <p>08:33 Rhiannon: Right. We're not watching people race right now. The votes are done.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>08:37 S1: Yeah, Right.</p>
                        <p>08:37 S1: Right.</p>
                        <p>08:40 S1: There's no more coming in...</p>
                        <p>08:40 Michael: Right. We're just [08:40] ____ it.</p>
                        <p>08:40 S1: There's a total and we're counting them.</p>
                        <p>08:42 Peter: Yeah, but you have to imagine... I sort of agree in a vacuum, that it does seem like the horse race, ongoing coverage of the election is awful, but I need you to envision the alternative, which is that you're stressing out for a week and then the next Sunday CNN's like, "Trump wins." And you're like, "Oh, fuck."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:00 Peter: And it all hits you a once. I don't want that.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:07 Rhiannon: To be honest, my emotions were so up and down that right now, the memory of this past week isn't even super there, and I wonder in years to come, if I'm trying to recall this awful week, if I'm just gonna black it out because it's too stressful and wild.</p>
                        <p>09:25 Michael: It's very surreal.</p>
                        <p>09:26 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:27 Michael: It was.</p>
                        <p>09:28 Peter: Yeah. So we don't wanna get too deep into the politics, but to me, politically, the real lesson of this election was that we are in a new era of politics and political engagement. Even to a greater extent than everyone understood. A lot of key assumptions about politics appear to be plainly untrue at this stage in history. And a big one that's long been held on the left, is that most people lean left on key issues but are not politically engaged, and that if you could just engage them, the left would win a lot more. And we've even talked about that here in the context of this election, that if you really drove turnout, Trump's loss would be inevitable. The more people you get out, the larger the margin becomes. But I think that the 2018 mid-terms, and Biden's under performance, make it clear that's not inherently true. Right-wing engagement with politics has reached a point where it's at a perpetual fever pitch and is capable of rising to meet the effective get out the vote efforts of the left. Last year, Biden said that Republicans would, quote, "Snap out of it once Trump was gone."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>10:37 Peter: That's even more clearly wrong now than it was when he said it, because as many people have observed, this is in a lot of ways, a victory for Trumpism, a narrow loss in a year with a global pandemic, tanked economy, racial tensions and riots, every single person's lived experience of this year was miserable and they barely lost. Barely. I think there's only one way to explain that. The right wing's engagement in politics is driven by a vast and deep network of propaganda that consists in large part of outright misinformation. We all knew that to some degree, politics had changed with Trump, but it was still assumed that things that really impact people's material reality, like the economy tanking, would hurt a sitting president badly. But, I think that this deeply entrenched propaganda network has in a lot of ways changed people's... Like their day-to-day experience of reality. It colors their perception so deeply that their own literal suffering is re-framed as anger and grievance and redirected at pre-defined out groups. And that perseverance of that manufactured reality in the face of real and tangible failures of the state, is a victory for Trump's brand of reactionary politics. And I think the only lingering long-term question to me, is whether that politics can survive without Trump himself.</p>
                        <p>12:03 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>12:03 Michael: Right. And so something I've been thinking about, and it's like, I'm reticent to do too much in-depth analysis right now when we don't even have complete vote counts and demographic data, what the elector looked like and all that stuff, but at a preliminary glance at least, Wisconsin seems to have been much closer than you'd expect given its demographically similar states. Like Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania. Those states generally, they're sort of akin, they move together. And the question is, Why is it much closer than Pennsylvania is going to be and Michigan was, and there's one explanation that sticks out, which is that it had an awful COVID outbreak in October. The worst in the country since New York.</p>
                        <p>12:53 Michael: And going into this, you would have thought that would have benefited Biden. How do you even reconcile the idea that having an awful COVID outbreak in fucking October helped Trump and the Republicans? What do you even do with that information? I don't wanna say this is definitely what happened, I think it's too early to state that with certainty, but it's concerning, it's something that's been on my mind a lot, the last few days. I don't even know how your politics goes forward, in light of that. That's something that requires a lot of soul searching and a lot of reflection on who you can reach and how you can reach them. That was one big thought I've had, another is that it's very hard to disentangle Biden's performance from the Democrats performance. Democrats did worse than Biden. When all is said and done, it seems like he's gonna have a result that if you told me a year ago Democrats would win by five points nationally and get 300 electoral votes, you'd be like, "All right, great. That's a successful campaign."</p>
                        <p>13:54 Michael: But what do you do with that when they lose ground in the house and they only pick up one seat in the Senate? They could still pick up two more, I don't wanna write off Georgia just yet. I think for sure, Warnock could win that race, Ossoff has a harder challenge. But in these conditions too, anybody who has claims they have answers right now about where to go, who's to blame, what to do next, I think is full of shit, but I'm concerned that those answers are gonna be hard to come by. And there's a lot of uncertainty, like Peter said, about what this is gonna look like when Trump is no longer a public figure, whether crazy QAnon freaks are still turning out but Democrats are not, or vice versa, or what. It's just a period of a lot of uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>14:38 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:39 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I think a lot hinges on what kind of role Trump takes after this. People talking about him leaving the public space and not being a public figure anymore, this man isn't gonna give up the attention, which is what drives him, the attention and the power. So as a media figure, starting his own channel, whatever that is, he's still going to be around and I think that it will depend a lot on what he builds his role as. Peter made the point about Biden saying last year that Republicans would just snap out of it if somebody else wins. Look, nobody snapped out of it after eight years of George W. Bush and then Obama, that's not how people's politics works, just the next day they up and they're like, "Okay... "</p>
                        <p>15:26 Peter: It's also not how cults work.</p>
                        <p>15:28 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. That's not how...</p>
                        <p>15:29 Michael: It's not.</p>
                        <p>15:29 Rhiannon: In particular, Trump's base works. I was watching especially the early results come back, seeing that this race was going to be closer than any of the polls indicated, all of that stuff. I think it's shocking to a lot of us that Trump actually grew his base, got more people to vote for him. Michael, I think you're right, that there isn't a lot of clarity about what to do to address that growing base, but I think you have to start with the understanding that these people, in their politics, approach politics, approach government, from a completely different premise.</p>
                        <p>16:09 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>16:10 Rhiannon: We're not talking about, "Joe Biden will do better on this policy than Trump has been able to deliver for you." They're not at that level of engagement with politics. Where they're at is, "All of this is corrupt, I reject all of it."</p>
                        <p>16:24 Michael: They're all crooks.</p>
                        <p>16:25 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. "They're all crooks, and so I have to choose the crook that speaks to me the best."</p>
                        <p>16:32 Peter: Yeah, and they're living on a diet of fucking Facebook posts.</p>
                        <p>16:35 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>16:38 Peter: It's a completely different type of media consumer than we've seen in political history.</p>
                        <p>16:43 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:43 Michael: Yeah. When I worked on campaigns, we often had vote targets, educated guesses about what we need in a specific precinct or a specific county to win. And I would not be surprised if a lot of these losing Democratic campaigns hit their vote targets. Biden basically matched Hillary's turn out in Miami-Dade County, which was his big loser county in Florida, but Trump got 200,000 more votes there. There are 200,000 people in Miami-Dade who spent four years living in Trump's America and were like, "Fuck yeah, now I'm ready. Now I'm coming out and I'm voting for the President."</p>
                        <p>17:19 Rhiannon: "I want more of this, baby."</p>
                        <p>17:20 Peter: They were mad about LeBron supporting Biden. This all makes sense.</p>
                        <p>17:25 Michael: Yeah that's right. So it's like...</p>
                        <p>17:26 Rhiannon: But I think, at the same time, it's really important... It's a little early to bring it into the conversation, but in Florida, a referendum on the minimum wage, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, passed in Florida with over 60% support.</p>
                        <p>17:41 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>17:41 Michael: Which was a policy supported by Joe Biden, it was on his platform. I believe he even cut ads about it.</p>
                        <p>17:46 Rhiannon: Yeah, these are the same people voting for Trump on the one hand, and also to raise the minimum wage to $15.</p>
                        <p>17:55 Peter: Fucking crazy.</p>
                        <p>17:56 Rhiannon: So, that's what I'm talking about. There's a disconnect there.</p>
                        <p>17:58 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:58 Peter: A massive failure of the Democratic Party. If the distance between the policy that is on their platform...</p>
                        <p>18:04 Rhiannon: Yes, yeah.</p>
                        <p>18:05 S1: And the votes garnered by the actual candidate, if there's a, whatever, 15 point gap almost, that is just a massive political failure.</p>
                        <p>18:14 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>18:15 Peter: The one thing, before we start talking about the legal shit going on, I wanna end on a slightly optimistic note. Initially, I was very pessimistic about the future, but you can already sort of see that there's a potential rift in the GOP between Trump and non-Trump.</p>
                        <p>18:31 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>18:32 Peter: If Trump refuses to concede in any meaningful way and the GOP tries to move on, you can see a real material divide forming, where the GOP is sort of split between these party loyalists and Trump loyalists. Trump probably has the upper hand in that fight frankly, but hard to imagine that a real political split in the GOP wouldn't be a disaster for them. If they don't sort it out by the mid-terms they'd be fucked.</p>
                        <p>19:01 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:01 Peter: Alright, let's talk about the law.</p>
                        <p>19:04 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>19:05 Peter: Obviously, the major concern that we voiced, going into this, was that maybe it's about to be Bush v. Gore 2.0, we've talked about that extensively, and legal challenges are ongoing, and so the question that we keep getting asked is, "Is there a chance that Trump can wriggle his way out of this through the courts?" And I think to be flatly honest, the answer is almost certainly no. I think that there is less than a 2% chance that you even see a really meaningful challenge get to the Supreme Court, let alone that he wins one. And that's a real 2%, not like Quinnipiac 2%.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:45 Rhiannon: Right. At the end of this, can you guys explain to me like why polls are so wrong?</p>
                        <p>19:49 Peter: Yeah. We can talk about polls being wrong. I think the real answer is that the current system for polling is just like, "Well, what if we sent everyone a fax and they fax back their preferred president."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:01 Rhiannon: Okay. So it's like in the outreach, they're not reaching people.</p>
                        <p>20:03 Peter: Yeah. A buddy of mine on Twitter was like, "It's obviously they're under-counting. Polls are under-counting Republicans." He was like, "What they should do is add the polling questions to telemarketing scams." So it's like, those Indian guys that call you claiming that they're Tom from Microsoft and then they throw in like, "And who are you voting for?" And those people will be like, "Trump." But what is wrong with my computer?" I think that will work.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:29 Peter: Yeah. So look the reason that we can be so confident that the courts aren't a realistic avenue for Trump is that there's only really two ways to use courts to win an election. One is like in Bush v. Gore sue to stop the vote counting. That's not gonna work here because Biden is ahead across all of the relevant swing states. The other option is to find a basis for challenging batches of ballots in the hopes that they are thrown out. That is still technically on the table but the GOP just has not found a color-able legal hook here. And that's mostly because the margins are just too big.</p>
                        <p>21:06 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>21:07 S1: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>21:07 Peter: The states appear to have just generally done a good job running the elections and as a result Trump's team has been litigious to some degree, but it's been really sort of ticky tack shit that won't really get them anywhere. Most of the Republican complaints about this stuff... And I've been by the way digging very deep into Republican media as you guys know for the past few days just to see what they're saying.</p>
                        <p>21:29 Rhiannon: Yeah, your poor brain.</p>
                        <p>21:29 Peter: Most of it is just sort of almost conceptual. They have a general sense that some fraud was occurring. They have no exact idea as to what that entails or how it's done and of course they can't articulate how they know that it's happening.</p>
                        <p>21:42 Michael: But they know that this can't be right.</p>
                        <p>21:43 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:45 Peter: Yeah. That's it. They just parrot the Trump line that mail-in ballots are shady. And then they latch on to every sort of error or singular instance of fraud that they can as evidence that something is afoot even though they have no real idea what that is. And some as always, just the biggest fucking bunch of morons on the planet.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:07 Rhiannon: No. That's it. And that tracks with this idea of a general sort of skepticism. You can tell me whatever the numbers are but I just don't think it's right. That's how the Trump base reacts when you talk to them about policy. Whatever it is you're telling me, I just think that's wrong.</p>
                        <p>22:23 Peter: Yeah. I think it would be useful though to just go state by state and touch on some of the legal challenges and explain why they're all pretty much just dumb bullshit.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Rhiannon: Yeah. Yeah. So the most substantive lawsuit out of the Trump campaign so far, probably the one in Nevada. So the Trump campaign there have alleged that thousands of ballots cast in Nevada were cast by people who are no longer living in the state or people who died and they have not up to this point provided any real evidence of fraud except [chuckle] for one 78-year-old woman who claims that she showed up at the polls on Tuesday on election day, but she was told that her vote had already been cast by mail. And she was told that the signature on the mail-in it matched her signature. She was offered the opportunity to challenge the ballot and she declined doing that. So if you're following the only specific instance of alleged fraud in Nevada that they have, is definitely just some lady who forgot that she voted by mail.</p>
                        <p>23:36 Peter: Yeah. 100%.</p>
                        <p>23:37 Michael: See that old lady.</p>
                        <p>23:37 Peter: The only reason that this has any teeth... So first of all they are challenging batches of ballots and that's important. It's definitely not gonna be enough at this point to flip Nevada but that was what made it a departure from the other states. The other thing is people do vote from out of state when they shouldn't. That happens all the time. Right?</p>
                        <p>23:55 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>23:55 Peter: People leave the state and if they... Especially if they want their vote to matter in a swing state. It's never gonna flip Nevada. They're never gonna be able to actually track this stuff down.</p>
                        <p>24:04 Michael: They're walking into a PR issue too because there was a thing that leaked that they had called out specific geographic tags or whatever, it turns out they were for Armed Services posted in Europe and Asia and stuff. And so they're gonna sit here and start saying that the military can't vote. The collateral damage here, if they start trying to challenge everyone who voted out of state is gonna be not pretty for them.</p>
                        <p>24:26 Rhiannon: Right. Exactly. This thing I think to keep in mind when we're talking about all of these legal challenges is two things. One is that they are dog shit stupid and the Trump campaign is getting dunked on in court left and right. That's great. But number two, the other thing is, no one of these lawsuits or even if they won altogether, it just doesn't matter. The numbers are not there. It's not gonna change the result.</p>
                        <p>24:52 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:52 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:52 Peter: Right. Okay, there's no pertinent legal challenge in Wisconsin. The bottom line there is there's gonna be a recount. The Trump campaign has requested a recount, although Wisconsin law requires that they pay for the recount which cost $3,000,000 and there are rumors that they have not ponied up.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:09 Rhiannon: Broke-ass, sorry-ass, punk-ass, dumbass bitches.</p>
                        <p>25:13 Michael: Right. Tell 'em.</p>
                        <p>25:14 Peter: Also it was a 20,000 vote margin. A recount changing that would be unprecedented just completely bizarre.</p>
                        <p>25:21 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>25:21 Michael: Yeah. Florida is a much bigger state their recount changed like 1000 votes I think.</p>
                        <p>25:26 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>25:26 Michael: And there was a recount recently in Wisconsin for Scott Walker and it only changed a few hundred votes.</p>
                        <p>25:31 Rhiannon: Right. Right. To get into the five-digit range on a recount in terms of the margin of error, it's unheard of. It just doesn't happen.</p>
                        <p>25:38 Peter: So Michigan is a done deal. It's interesting because I think a lot of people think that Michigan was close just because of the way the Trump campaign and the news media played it. The margin in Michigan is over 150,000 votes right now.</p>
                        <p>25:51 Michael: Yeah. It's comfortable.</p>
                        <p>25:53 Peter: Yeah. There was some drama there. Essentially, when Michigan began to swing to Biden... This is when Republicans started freaking out. And there were calls for Republican poll workers to converge on the Detroit polling locations to watch the count. Trump sued, claiming that his poll watchers weren't being granted access which the judge quickly surmised was bullshit and threw out. The GOP poll watchers then engage in a number of bad faith attempts to challenge ballots, including at least one request that a ballot be thrown out because "It looks sticky," by some poll watcher.</p>
                        <p>26:28 Rhiannon: Love that.</p>
                        <p>26:28 Peter: Yeah. At some point, the GOP strategy openly shifted to challenging literally every single ballot, so poll-watchers would be like, "I challenge that one, I challenge that one," and they would all have to be reviewed. All of this slowed down the count, but did nothing to change the outcome. Michigan was also the location of a reporting glitch that briefly showed Biden getting over 100,000 votes, without Trump getting any, which was quickly corrected, but of course, corrections mean nothing in the right-wing media world, and that is still being talked about, in right-wing circles as evidence that some fraud is occurring. And I think this brings us to Pennsylvania, which is where most of the drama is, currently. Most of the substantive issues in Pennsylvania unfolded before the election, which we've talked about...</p>
                        <p>27:16 Rhiannon: That's right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:18 Peter: When the GOP challenged late arriving ballots, as a result... Well, the Supreme Court didn't rule one way or another on whether they would toss out the late arriving ballots, they did request that the state set aside those ballots, in case a later ruling on their validity was necessary. But the gap in Pennsylvania is too big for those ballots to matter, so it's sort of moot and despite a whole lot of whining about unfairness, Trump's campaign hasn't really found another substantial legal hook in the state.</p>
                        <p>27:43 Michael: Right. And I think this highlights that Trump's legal operation writ large, prior to the election, was really effective, and it was everywhere, it was in a bunch of different states, literally hundreds of lawsuits, they racked up a ton of wins, very hack-ish job by a lot of Republican judges, coming down on the side of the GOP, time and time again, on the side of the Trump campaign.</p>
                        <p>28:09 Rhiannon: Right. You could see it was a concerted effort, right? They were organized.</p>
                        <p>28:13 Michael: Right. But the flip side of that has been, that they essentially put everybody on notice about what they were planning to do after the election, and as a result, this has been one of the best run elections in memory, leaving them almost nothing to challenge. And two, left the situation, like in Pennsylvania, where the best ballots for them to challenge, have been segregated. If all those late arriving ballots had been mixed in and counted with the rest of the mail ballots, the GOP could now be arguing, "Hey, those shouldn't be counted." And we could have a big debate about, "Oh, you should have said this months ago, weeks ago, whatever, and that should be barred and that we know how many arrived and it wouldn't have made a difference," but that would all be hypothetical, you could see how this would work...</p>
                        <p>29:01 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, totally.</p>
                        <p>29:03 Michael: To make this seem not legit, but instead, what they've done is helped Pennsylvania do this in a way, where the results are unassailable.</p>
                        <p>29:11 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, so their over-litigiousness, pre-election, fucked them for all of these challenges in the past week, after the votes were in.</p>
                        <p>29:19 Peter: Right, they did their best to cheat. But what are you gonna do, when you're cheating and your opponent's beating you?</p>
                        <p>29:23 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>29:23 Peter: "Well, that was that."</p>
                        <p>29:27 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>29:27 Rhiannon: We gave it the good college try, y'all.</p>
                        <p>29:31 Michael: And so I do think who deserve some praise are one, all the people involved in the actual administration of these elections.</p>
                        <p>29:38 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:39 Michael: And I think, Democratic party made a real big effort in the last few months, to educate voters about...</p>
                        <p>29:42 Peter: I think that's right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:44 Michael: The best ways to vote, and when to do it. As a result, there are very few ballots even in the segregated population in Pennsylvania, 'cause most people voted on time, or if their mail ballots were late, they went and cast provisionals in person instead and people got it right. And then the states did their part to count right. And as a result, Trump has nowhere to go.</p>
                        <p>30:05 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>30:06 Michael: The courts aren't gonna be very receptive to their arguments.</p>
                        <p>30:08 Peter: Yeah, the campaign also publicly claimed that their poll watchers were not being given access to the counting in Philly. Unfortunately, that blew up, when a federal judge asked their lawyers straight up, if it was true, and they had to admit that it was not.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:27 Michael: Yeah, exactly. They didn't have nothing, they're literally like, "They're not letting us in." "Well, are they really not letting... "</p>
                        <p>30:33 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:33 Michael: "Well, they're letting us in."</p>
                        <p>30:36 Peter: Yeah, right.</p>
                        <p>30:37 Michael: "I got to admit."</p>
                        <p>30:37 Peter: There are some developments in Pennsylvania... 'Cause again, I'm deep in Breitbart world right now. The current move is that they have a supposed whistleblower, who works for USPS, who is claiming that he overheard someone planning to back date mail-in ballots that arrived late, which of course would be against the law. They also stated in their press conference at a landscaping company off of I-95, that they have identified a few dead people who voted. One lady apparently died on October 22nd, and then applied for and cast a ballot after that date. Which if true, is probably evidence that her grieving husband or something, cast a vote on her behalf, after she died, which is illegal, but that's not gonna give Trump Pennsylvania.</p>
                        <p>31:23 Rhiannon: Right, what I love about this is, "Okay, minus one, Biden." What do you want? Okay. That doesn't do anything, bro. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>31:32 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>31:32 Peter: It has long been the republican position... This is no joke, they think that Democrats are just rounding up the names of dead people and having them vote, in bulk.</p>
                        <p>31:42 Rhiannon: Right, right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>31:43 Peter: They have no real basis for believing that, but every little story like this, adds to that narrative. They also claim that Joe Frazier, the famous boxer, who died in 2011, voted this year, and my genuine best guess is that they saw a dude named Joe Frazier had voted and they were like, "Joe Frazier, the boxer? That guy's dead." My best example of how far right media is handling this, like the Breitbart's of the world, is that there's a story about a... I told you guys about this. A Pennsylvania mailman got caught on the other side of the Canadian border...</p>
                        <p>32:15 Rhiannon: Oh, right.</p>
                        <p>32:16 Peter: With mail, which is against the law. That's against their rules. You can't take mail to another country, I guess. And he claims that he just took a wrong exit.</p>
                        <p>32:25 Rhiannon: Right, he was on the highway.</p>
                        <p>32:25 Peter: But one way or another, he had 800 pieces of mail, among those 800 pieces of mail, there were three absentee ballots. So the headline on every right wing website was like, "USPS worker caught bringing the ballots across the border... "</p>
                        <p>32:40 Rhiannon: Right, right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:42 Peter: And it's like, "Are you fucking kidding me dude?"</p>
                        <p>32:42 Michael: Three ballots.</p>
                        <p>32:44 Peter: This shit is important to some to read, because what they're implicitly accusing Democrats of, is a fraud scheme on par with the greatest crimes in history, in its complexity.</p>
                        <p>32:55 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>32:55 Peter: And what they have as evidence are these just little bullshit instances, of what maybe constitutes voter fraud. Not to mention that democrats didn't win the Pennsylvania state legislature, for example.</p>
                        <p>33:10 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>33:10 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:11 Peter: Meaning that if there were hundreds of thousands of faked ballots, many of them would have had to have votes for Republicans on them. It doesn't seem like that would have been the move.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>33:20 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>33:20 Michael: No. I would have gone big, especially given the polling, you have all this pulling information and all this expectations, Democrats that they could win 53, 54 senate seats.</p>
                        <p>33:30 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:31 Michael: Instead, we're praying that they could, by the skin of their teeth, get to 50.</p>
                        <p>33:36 Rhiannon: Don't you think we would have given ourselves a landslide? Why...</p>
                        <p>33:39 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>33:40 Michael: I do think people have trouble with orders of magnitude, the difference between three ballots and 100,000 is like the difference between zero and 100,000, they're just not even in the same universe and people have trouble even comprehending what 100,000 ballots would look like and what it would take to falsify that.</p>
                        <p>33:58 Rhiannon: I completely, embarrassingly relate, because I don't understand the difference between a million and a billion.</p>
                        <p>34:04 Peter: But that's like a human thing. You don't have to be embarrassed. That's like a normal human...</p>
                        <p>34:07 Michael: Yeah, that's normal.</p>
                        <p>34:08 Peter: You're not supposed to be able to comprehend...</p>
                        <p>34:10 Rhiannon: Okay, well, this part is embarrassing, which is that for a long time, many years, I thought Justin Bieber was a billionaire.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>34:15 Peter: You moron, he's only worth $300 million. Georgia's currently about a 10,000 vote race, tightest of the outstanding states, and as such, seems like a plausible target for litigation. But elsewhere, so far, the GOP has been able to do nothing but stir up rumors about technical glitches that they found suspicious.</p>
                        <p>34:41 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:42 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:42 Peter: Worth noting that just yesterday, the right wing media went nuts about a reporting glitch in Georgia, and then they fixed the glitch and it turned out, the glitch actually helped Trump and now Biden is up by even more.</p>
                        <p>34:52 Rhiannon: Amazing.</p>
                        <p>34:54 Peter: The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit about ballots that arrived after the election deadline, being counted, that was dismissed pretty quickly, when multiple election officials testified that they had actually been received on time. There's stuff being fought about in Georgia. I haven't seen any legal action that would be enough to challenge the legitimacy or validity of a 10,000 ballot gap that now exists between the candidates.</p>
                        <p>35:18 Michael: The Georgia lawsuit, that was the one where the evidence was somebody who's like, "Oh, those came in late." And then when they had to swear that at oath, they were like, "Well, I think that... "</p>
                        <p>35:27 Peter: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:28 Rhiannon: Right, "I'm actually not sure if those came in late."</p>
                        <p>35:31 Michael: They had an aura, a late ballot aura.</p>
                        <p>35:33 Peter: Right. Right, right.</p>
                        <p>35:34 Rhiannon: Now that I read that this says under penalty of perjury, I'm not so sure that I really know when they came in.</p>
                        <p>35:40 Peter: "Your Honor, when you say penalty of perjury, can you be more specific about the penalty?" Yeah, this is a part of a trend in these lawsuits, where someone will speak up in conservative media, like, "I have witnessed this wrong doing." So the lawyers descend on them and they're like, "Will you swear to that?" And they're like, "Oh. Well, maybe."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:07 Rhiannon: "When you put it that way."</p>
                        <p>36:08 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:08 Michael: Yeah, Trump is... They're desperate for anything, to get into court right now. But that's what happens, they're like, "Okay, let's fucking go." And then they're like, "Well, I don't know." And there's like 53 ballots, it wasn't even that many.</p>
                        <p>36:21 Peter: There's just nothing here, and I think that is the story across these states, they've just been finding these tiny little things, but they are not going to set the legal groundwork to find a hook, to investigate tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of ballots across these states, let alone to change the outcome by that sort of margin, it's just not really possible. There is one case in Pennsylvania that just popped up Monday night, that does seem to be a little bit broader in scope, than some of the more ticky tack cases that Trump has brought thus far, and the case is basically saying that mail-in votes are subject to less scrutiny than in-person votes, and that's unconstitutional and violation of the equal protection clause and the electors clause. And what they're looking for, is a holding that mail-in voting is unconstitutional.</p>
                        <p>37:11 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:13 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:14 Peter: They're never gonna get that, but this is the first lawsuit that is broad enough, in scope, that it feels like it would be at least theoretically challenging the validity of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of ballots. I don't think they're gonna get there. I think it's incredibly frivolous bullshit, but it is sort of a lawsuit of the size you would need, to start turning around an election that Trump clearly lost.</p>
                        <p>37:39 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:39 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>37:40 Peter: Alright, before we keep going, let's go to an Ad. One thing we should address... We did an episode, a few weeks back, about an electoral college coup, "Could Trump take advantage of the electoral college rules to somehow get enough electoral votes?" I think the answer to that is just sort of technically, yes, there are a bunch of avenues, but the only real realistic one is that Republican state legislatures in, say Pennsylvania could just reject the outcome, calling it illegitimate and propose a slate of their own electors. That's going to run into problems. Pennsylvania, for example, has a Democratic Governor, who would probably propose his own set of electors under the rules, the Supreme Court probably would just defer to the state legislature. So in a lot of ways, this is just a political question, more than a legal one, "Are the state legislatures ballsy enough to do this or stupid enough to do this?" My instinct is that they're probably not gonna get there. What would be the basis for really rejecting it? They would need the full support of the full Republican delegation, across these states. That would be very difficult.</p>
                        <p>38:46 Michael: I think this stuff has been in the air a little bit, Newt Gingrich mentioned it on Fox News, other politicians have talked about it, and clearly, early on, in election week from hell, there were Republican legislatures talking about the vote tallying being illegitimate and this outcome maybe being on the table, the electoral college coup, and I just think politically, it didn't play out in a way where they feel comfortable doing it. I think they've surveyed the scene at this point and been like, they don't think they could get away with it, or they don't think that it would fly, one way or another. Which is why the head of the delegation in the Pennsylvania House, I think, has said that they're not gonna do it. Which is, I think, basically sort of being like. At the end of the day, they counted the votes in a way that people generally believe the results, and we can't even pretend in a plausible way.</p>
                        <p>39:39 Peter: So let's move in to some sort of interesting down ballot stuff. You could tune in to some nerd ass podcasts, for senate and house stuff, but I feel like there are some actually genuinely good news, in the DA election space. Rhia, are you up on this stuff?</p>
                        <p>39:53 Rhiannon: Yeah, most importantly, really big one is that in Los Angeles County, progressive prosecutor candidate, George Gascon, or Gascon...</p>
                        <p>40:02 Peter: I don't think it's Gascon, that's the beauty and the beast guy.</p>
                        <p>40:05 Rhiannon: Well, it has the accent.</p>
                        <p>40:07 Michael: Gascon?</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>40:09 Rhiannon: In Los Angeles County, the progressive prosecutor candidate, George Gascon won. This race was by the New York Times called, "The most important district attorney race in the country." Gascon is now the district attorney in a jurisdiction over 10 million people, so this is a really big win in sort of the decarceral... Getting rid of cash bail, those kinds of movements and the progressive prosecutor movement across the country, in general. Another huge thing, in terms of applying sort of decarceral logic, Oregon is the first state in the country now, to decriminalize personal possession of all drugs, including heroin, cocaine, meth. So that's really, really huge for Oregon.</p>
                        <p>40:54 Peter: Yeah, also, does anyone know what a one bedroom goes for, over there?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>41:01 Rhiannon: Congrats to Oregon, the coolest state in the country. And decriminalization of drugs, not just marijuana, is really important, in terms of criminal justice reform, because personal possession of drugs, ends up being the sort of mechanism that drives mass incarceration. So that's great. And then marijuana, legalized or medical marijuana use, decriminalized in a bunch of states. Arizona. What up? I'm just excited in saying that, as somebody who lives in Texas. Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, South Dakota, way to go. Texas, get your shit together.</p>
                        <p>41:42 Michael: Did we mention, I think DC decriminalized shrooms, as well.</p>
                        <p>41:46 Rhiannon: Oh, right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>41:47 Michael: Things gonna get weird, in the next legislative session. [chuckle] Control of the Michigan State Supreme Court changed, from Republicans to Democrats.</p>
                        <p>41:58 Rhiannon: That's huge.</p>
                        <p>42:00 Michael: That'll be good, because Michigan is gerrymandered, Michigan should be a fairer state, electorally, going forward, than it has been in the last decade. And that's a good thing.</p>
                        <p>42:10 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>42:11 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>42:12 Peter: A bunch of other stuff happened, there was some good news in wage laws, we mentioned that Florida passed the $15 minimum wage, paid family leave was expanded in Colorado, Louisiana got rid of the Confederate flag, that is on its flag, is just replaced now, with the words, "The white race is the superior race," so small step forward in Louisiana.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:36 Michael: Mississippi got rid of their weird electoral college that they had for state-wide office.</p>
                        <p>42:41 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah.</p>
                        <p>42:42 Michael: Which is good. Which is a real... A legacy of Jim Crow and a step in the right direction, for having more representatives and fair elections at the state level.</p>
                        <p>42:49 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>42:50 Peter: Yeah, both Utah and Nebraska modified their constitutions, to remove slavery as a punishment...</p>
                        <p>42:56 Michael: For crimes, yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:01 Peter: For crimes. Congrats.</p>
                        <p>43:01 Rhiannon: Thanks.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>43:01 Michael: Way to keep up with the times.</p>
                        <p>43:03 Peter: That's a joke about how behind the times Utah and Nebraska are. But that puts them ahead of the United States Constitution...</p>
                        <p>43:11 Rhiannon: Agreed.</p>
                        <p>43:12 Peter: Which still allows for slavery as a punishment.</p>
                        <p>43:12 Rhiannon: That's what the 13th Amendment says.</p>
                        <p>43:15 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>43:15 Peter: So let us talk a bit about the Supreme Court. Obviously, we were banking on this going to the Supreme Court, which would have been bad for America, but just gangbusters for the podcast.</p>
                        <p>43:25 Rhiannon: Just beautiful content. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:27 S3: Obviously, we're not quite there, but we should talk about what this election means for the court, moving forward. Obviously, the clear implication of not winning the Senate, or at least probably not winning the Senate, is that court reform through legislation, is effectively off the table here. It would be hard to get court reform through even a nominally democratic senate, let alone a GOP-controlled one. That does leave one option on the table, which we've discussed, which is ignoring the court. What if Joe Biden's administration simply treats the court's rulings as non-binding? It's an interesting possibility. You can listen more to our court reform episode, to hear us talk about it. We've talked about the trade-offs, and the big one is that it might result in Republican state governments also ignoring federal courts, and it's hard to see that trade-off being worth it, if we don't control the Senate and can't pass meaningful, progressive legislation. It feels like wasting ammunition, to say, "Alright, we're gonna ignore the Supreme Court," when you can't even get meaningful, progressive legislation passed. It's not like Biden can use this to save a green new deal or something that would actually be worth it. He's gonna just be passing executive orders and shit.</p>
                        <p>44:34 Michael: But this does highlight the importance of the Georgia run-offs.</p>
                        <p>44:37 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:39 Michael: Even if Ossoff or Warnock, or both, don't really excite you, they're probably worth your time or your money or something, because the Supreme Court's not getting reformed with a 50 vote, quote unquote, "Majority," with Vice President Kamala Harris providing the tie-breaking vote, but the lower courts might get expanded and the caliber of justice or judge that Joe Biden can nominate and get through the Senate, it would be much higher, in this scenario. The Supreme Court and courts in general, and the judicial system in general, would be much healthier, if they win those run off races.</p>
                        <p>45:14 Peter: I am sort of mentally and emotionally preparing myself for the Democrats to score an own goal here, by passing Ro Khanna's forward-looking, term limits bill, so that the term limits only apply to Biden's appointees.</p>
                        <p>45:28 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, right. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>45:30 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>45:30 Peter: Alright, we should talk about the composition of the court. There's a solid six. The oldest conservatives are Alito and Thomas, who are, I think, both 71. Thomas looks like shit though, he could die.</p>
                        <p>45:43 Rhiannon: Yeah, he's eating...</p>
                        <p>45:43 Michael: He could.</p>
                        <p>45:44 Rhiannon: A lot of cheeseburgers still.</p>
                        <p>45:45 Peter: He's been on the court for so fucking long. One of the really good things about Biden winning, from a court perspective, is that if he hadn't, I think there's a really good shot that Thomas retired at the end of Trump's second term.</p>
                        <p>45:57 Michael: Yeah. And Alito and Thomas are both dumb enough right-wing nuts that I could see them at mask-free, indoor parties or whatever.</p>
                        <p>46:06 Rhiannon: Oh, good point. Yeah. Oh, definitely.</p>
                        <p>46:07 Michael: In two months, when it's 500,000 Coronavirus cases a day, in the middle of this awful surge, they could definitely get sick.</p>
                        <p>46:17 Peter: Yeah. If you're coming home every night, and sharing a bed with Ginni Thomas, you're never safe.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>46:27 Michael: Yeah, and I do think if we assume that Democrats can only win one or none of the Georgia run-offs and Republicans control the Senate, it's worth wondering what that looks like for Joe Biden placing judges and justices. I wouldn't be surprised if McConnell lets him have a Brier replacement on the Supreme Court, it would have to be somebody moderate. I think they would take that as a way that they could prove that they're being bipartisan and good and things are quote, unquote "Returning to normal" while they fend off a young, black, progressive woman and instead end up with Merrick Garland or some other milquetoast white dude who's only gonna be around for 15 years.</p>
                        <p>47:10 Peter: A bluff that I think Biden should call because the optics of the Republicans...</p>
                        <p>47:14 Michael: I agree.</p>
                        <p>47:14 Peter: Holding back on a black female candidate... Which was Biden's promise, would be disastrous I think, for them.</p>
                        <p>47:21 Michael: Absolutely. And after all their shit from Merrick Garland and Coney Barrett, if then in the first year of his term, they're still not giving his nominee a hearing or they're voting them down on party lines, like, fucking do it. I agree, I think the Biden position here has to be sort of picking fights with the Supreme Court and with the Senate on this stuff and highlighting how political it is and keeping it relevant as an issue for the base and not seeming like it's something that they're walking away from.</p>
                        <p>47:55 Peter: I think there really is an open question about whether McConnell continues the Obama era strategy of just stone-walling on lower courts.</p>
                        <p>48:03 Michael: I think that's a tougher... They don't have a huge majority, they can only handle losing one or two votes basically. And Biden has long relationships with a lot of key senators, with Grassley, with Graham. Look, I don't wanna buy into this bullshit that they're gonna snap out of it 'cause they're not, they're gonna do what's best for them. But they might think that what's best for them is for a few years to just say, "Okay," if Biden is nominating moderates. And that might be what we see for the next couple of years, is them trying to reduce the temperature on this. 'Cause they've already won, they have control of major circuits. They control the Fifth Circuit, they control the Eleventh Circuit, they control the Supreme Court. They've dulled the Democrats hold on the Ninth Circuit considerably. These are major circuits that cover Texas and Florida and California, and a lot of the sources... A ton of litigation. So that gives them avenues to make any legal inroads they want. They can just bring cases in Texas pretty much whenever they want and get the ruling they want heading into the Supreme Court where then they have a six vote majority. So why keep it a battle ground if they can make it seem A political again, that might be in their interests.</p>
                        <p>49:21 Peter: I think all the more reason for the Democrats to say, "Fuck that" and not nominate moderates and turn it into a fight. If you don't have Congress and you can't...</p>
                        <p>49:29 Michael: I agree.</p>
                        <p>49:29 Peter: Pass meaningful legislation, what else do you have to do?</p>
                        <p>49:31 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>49:31 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>49:31 Peter: Besides fight over this stuff.</p>
                        <p>49:32 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>49:40 Peter: Alright, next week we're actually doing a case. Arizona Free Enterprise v Bennett case about campaign financing, the lengths that the Supreme Court has gone to ensure the power of big money in politics. And that should just about round out our election themed episodes as we move, thank God, out of election season, into some sort of lame duck session hell. [laughter] The depths of which we cannot possibly prepare you for. [laughter] Follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod. Enjoy the victory, enjoy watching Donald Trump have what I can only imagine is going to be a sustained and lengthy bitch fit over the course of the next week or two.</p>
                        <p>50:35 Rhiannon: I'm gonna very much enjoy that and I'm gonna enjoy screaming at Joe Biden and his administration for the next four years.</p>

                        <p>0:00:02 Leon: Hey everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Slow Burn. This week, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about how the Supreme Court could be fixed through Court packing and other means. They also talk to special guest, California Congressman Ro Khanna. Khanna introduced a House bill to impose term limits on the Supreme Court Justices.</p>
                        <p>0:00:22 Ro Khanna: Well, it's very simple, there shouldn't be Supreme Court Justices who are there for 40, 50 years.</p>
                        <p>0:00:27 Leon: But the hosts think it does not go far enough to reverse decades of conservative judicial activism. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>0:00:47 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have taken control of American life, like that fungus that takes control of ants' brains and turns them into zombies. I am Peter, I'm here with Michael...</p>

                        <p>0:01:08 Peter: You guys know about that fungus?</p>
                        <p>0:01:09 Michael: I do, it's fascinating. I wondered if COVID had that effect when Trump started talking about kissing men as well.</p>
                        <p>0:01:18 Peter: No, he got the ant fungus.</p>
                        <p>0:01:21 Michael: That's what it is.</p>
                        <p>0:01:22 Peter: He's also susceptible.</p>
                        <p>0:01:25 Rhiannon: His brain is the same as an ant's brain.</p>
                        <p>0:01:30 Peter: So today we are talking about Court reform. Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to the Supreme Court is at this point leaving us staring at a 6-3 conservative majority, and that leaves us with the question: What is there to be done about these goddamn people? A couple of weeks ago, we had a listener Q&A episode where we talked a bit about reforming the Court, and we want to expand and expound on some of the ideas we discussed. And we'll also be talking to Congressman Ro Khanna, who has proposed a bill imposing term limits on the Supreme Court, and has openly been discussing more aggressive Court reforms moving forward, and whose PR people have made a terrible, terrible mistake. We are ringing through the halls of power, folks.</p>
                        <p>0:02:22 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:02:23 Peter: So what we want to do with this episode is yes, talk about some possible ways to reform the Court, but also provide you with what we think is a useful lens through which to view possible Court reforms. You've probably seen a bunch of proposals floating around for how to reform the Court, how to fix the Court, and it's not always easy, especially if you're not a lawyer or you're not familiar with the machinations of government to evaluate how effective they would be.</p>
                        <p>0:02:48 Peter: So we want to give you a simple framework to distinguish between two different types of reform. The first is reform that is designed to take political power away from the Court, and the second is reform designed to shift the Court itself toward the left. This is an important distinction to make, because these types of reforms are designed to address very different problems. It's true that the Court currently wields a lot of political power and probably too much, and there are reforms that can sort of serve as a valve to let out some of that pressure and lower the stakes a little bit, and that can be a good thing, but it doesn't in our review solve the real problem.</p>
                        <p>0:03:26 Peter: The real problem with the Court is that it is pervaded with a deeply reactionary ideology. And that's not the fault of a system or a procedural mechanism that can be altered, it's the fault of 6 or soon to be 6 far-right Justices who themselves are reflective of an increasingly reactionary right-wing politics in this country. So we want to provide this analytical framework, A, so you can understand Court reforms a little more clearly, but also so that you can understand that there is only one reform that we think goes far enough: Packing the Court. And we say packing the Court, we mean one way or another, adding Justices to the Court. The time for more moderate institutional reform has long passed, we're at a point where what we really need, what this country really needs is more left-leaning Justices on the Court.</p>
                        <p>0:04:17 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I think we should maybe open up this discussion by talking about the discourse around Court reform right now, because a lot of it is really misguided. A lot of the discourse is centered around the idea that the Court is kind of like too political and needs to be made less political, but that is, if you've listened to this podcast, you know we think that's just nonsense. No matter what you do to the Court, it will be a body that makes decisions about laws that affect millions of people, and as a result, there's no way to remove politics from that.</p>
                        <p>0:04:52 Michael: Right, if you wanted to describe the biggest problem in American politics, it's like huge segments of the population and their representatives are like fucking right-wing freaks who believe in QAnon et al, expressly calling for fascism in this country.</p>
                        <p>0:05:11 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:05:12 Michael: And the courts are just as much a part of that problem as are the other branches of government and the fucking psychos who go to Trump rallies. But nobody's talking about reforming Congress, right? There are, I'm sure, some procedural ways that we could change the Senate to limit like Lindsey Graham's influence and power, but the problem with Lindsey Graham is that he's an amoral piece of shit, that for some reason like the voters of South Carolina continued to send to office, right? That's the problem. And the fix to that is like making him immaterial by putting him in the fucking minority, and we should be willing to talk about the Court in the same way.</p>
                        <p>0:05:56 Peter: Yeah. Yeah, I'm very sympathetic to the idea that the Court wields too much power, 'cause it's true, right, it absolutely does. It's nine unelected elites who are each more powerful than all but maybe a small handful of elected officials in this country. And it would be good to reduce that power a bit. But when the Court is composed of a supermajority of fascists, that's a band-aid on a bullet wound. It's not addressing the real problem. I feel like a lot of dorky journalists and academics like this approach because it feels like non-partisan, but I think their minds have been corrupted by notions of fairness that don't exist in the real world. And it reminds me of movies where there's a super weapon and the good guy's mission is not to get the super weapon and use it against the bad guys, but instead to just destroy the weapon.</p>
                        <p>0:06:44 Michael: Toss the ring into the fire.</p>
                        <p>0:06:47 Peter: Exactly, exactly. Like no one should hold this power, it's too much. Cool and very noble stuff, but maybe it would be a bit more meaningful in a world where we are not in the midst of a world-defining cultural, social and political battle, with immense human stakes. If Democrats seize control of Congress and the Senate this year, they need to use the power, you don't disarm yourselves when you have the upper hand, and this is an opportunity to take that power and wield it for good. So in light of this, while we are pretty supportive in general of various options for reform and we will discuss their merits, there's only one that will really work, and that's packing the fucking Court.</p>
                        <p>0:07:27 Michael: I like the super weapon analogy, because also the super weapon isn't the Court, which is the way it's being sort of put forward by some commentators. The super weapon is having a supermajority of insane fascists on the Court. And if you want to blow up that weapon, what you do is you deprive them of that majority, which means either like you remove them or you just increase the Court until they are like on the fringe. Those are the two options if you want to destroy the super weapon, pack the fucking Court.</p>
                        <p>0:08:02 Rhiannon: Right. One proposal that we're going to be talking about with Congressman Ro Khanna in just a bit, one proposal for reforming the Court is term limits, putting term limits on Supreme Court Justices so that their appointment is not for a lifetime. And the intent obviously of a term limit proposal is pretty clear. If the Justices aren't serving 30 to 40-year terms, the political stakes therefore surrounding the nomination process aren't quite as high, and you're more likely to see an even distribution of Justices across the ideological spectrum. Those are good things, but it should be obvious that they're also sort of tinkering with the institutional machinations of the Court to make them nominally more fair.</p>
                        <p>0:08:49 Peter: So the current proposals to add term limits would likely not change the make-up of the Court for another 10 to 15 years at best. Now, that's assuming that the Democrats would have political power at the time when the current Justices start leaving the Court.</p>
                        <p>0:09:02 Rhiannon: Right, there's also the fact, as we'll discuss with Congressman Khanna in just a bit, that term limits are fairly likely to be held unconstitutional, actually.</p>
                        <p>0:09:13 Michael: Right. The Constitution says that the Supreme Court Justices stay in office in good behavior, which basically is interpreted to mean that it's a life term, unless they do something that's essentially impeachable, so that's basically the only way to get them out of office.</p>
                        <p>0:09:27 Peter: Yeah, not good, not a good feature of a reform. There's also the idea that instead of a Supreme Court, we'd have a rotating panel of justices from the lower courts. Speaking of definitely unconstitutional reforms. This would result in more ideological diversity, and you would also get more judicial restraint; most likely justices may feel like they're not in a position to aggressively rule one way or the other because they're not full-time members of the Court. And you also might see the Court bounce back and forth on key issues depending on who is on the Supreme Court panel at a given time. Again, there's an argument that term limits are constitutional. I genuinely don't know what the argument is that this is constitutional. I guess the President could agree to it, and if the President agreed to it because the President is granted the right to appoint Justices, then maybe it's constitutional then, but what's the point of that when the next President can just get rid of it.</p>
                        <p>0:10:24 Peter: There's also another problem with it, which is Mitch McConnell stonewalled Obama appointees and has pushed Trump's appointees through at an unprecedented rate, meaning the lower courts are not ideologically balanced at all. I think in terms of the sort of reforms that add up to institutional tinkering, this is probably the best, at least in theory, because I think you could actually see a more restrained Court and one that tends towards ideological balance. That feels like a real way to lessen the Court's power. Unfortunately, I think this is like the most pie in the sky in terms of actually getting it done. And maybe we should take this opportunity, since we had mentioned lower courts, to talk about lower court reform. This is a Supreme Court podcast, but certainly if the Democrats are able to muster enough political capital to institute significant Supreme Court reform, it would be a huge mistake not to do the same thing to the lower courts, the most obvious reform being to expand them because you now have a massive number of Trump appointees, vastly disproportionate.</p>
                        <p>0:11:37 Rhiannon: Yeah, a quarter of all federal judges on the bench were appointed by the Trump administration. That's a quarter, 25%. One in four.</p>
                        <p>0:11:47 Michael: It's not right, we gotta get that number down.</p>
                        <p>0:11:49 Peter: Get that down to a solid zero.</p>
                        <p>0:11:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, I like zero more.</p>
                        <p>0:11:54 Michael: Yeah. Unlike the Supreme Court, which has been fixed at nine for a very long time, the lower courts expand all the time, like the 11th Circuit is relatively new. It's younger than me. We added I think 150 district courts in 1981 or something like that, as well as a whole new federal appellate circuit. And the caseload is huge, it's much bigger than it used to be, there should be no controversy, this is just like good governance sort of thing that needs to be done regardless.</p>
                        <p>0:12:20 Peter: Yeah, even if you took away the ideological aspect, everyone knows the federal courts are over-burdened and need to be relieved, and the only way to do that is to add more judges.</p>
                        <p>0:12:30 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I'm glad that we're talking about lower courts, because I think the entire federal court system needs to be reformed. We are hearing words like reform the Court, pack the Court, that kind of thing, but it's always sort of limited to just the Supreme Court and reforming the federal courts to the better has to take into account the lower courts as well. One aspect that I like about making sure that we're talking about the lower courts as well is that right now you see Republicans sort of using deference to the Supreme Court and respect for the institution of the Supreme Court. They're weaponizing that in the dialogue and discourse about Court packing.</p>
                        <p>0:13:10 Rhiannon: So they're saying, it's this untouchable institution, it's been nine, you can't expand it. That kind of thing, basically setting it up to look like Court packing is this radical act that shouldn't be accepted by the public. But when we make sure that we're talking about lower court reform too, you can see that Republicans have been doing just that, packing the courts, for the past few years, that's been Mitch McConnell's thing is making sure that those lower court appointments get through and blocking Democrat appointments to federal appeals courts and federal district courts.</p>
                        <p>0:13:45 Michael: And there's some real fucking monsters in the lower courts.</p>
                        <p>0:13:50 Rhiannon: Absolutely awful, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:13:50 Michael: Just really, really awful judges, ones that like the American Bar Association has been like, they're not qualified. Not qualified to be a judge, sorry.</p>
                        <p>0:14:00 Rhiannon: And these are people denying prisoners rights, denying reproductive rights, denying immigrants rights, they're doing this all of the time, and then you think about the tiny percentage of cases that the Supreme Court actually accepts, and so these are the people, the lower courts, that's where Justice Sotomayor has said, that's where the law is me. So they're really, really important.</p>
                        <p>0:14:21 Peter: Yeah, I mean, look, the Fifth Circuit held last week that Texas has planned to have one ballot dropbox in each county, meaning like one in Houston, and then one in rural counties that have a few thousand people...</p>
                        <p>0:14:35 Rhiannon: For mail-in ballots, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:14:35 Ro Khanna: Doesn't negatively impact anyone's ability to vote. That's one step below the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:14:43 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:14:43 Michael: They also said, just recently, voters have no due process rights in any sort of notification or anything like that, if the state finds a problem with their absentee ballot, like if there's a signature matching issue or whatever, literally the state can just throw out their ballot...</p>
                        <p>0:15:00 Rhiannon: And you would never know.</p>
                        <p>0:15:00 Michael: Without giving them a chance to cure the issue in the name of chasing some imaginary like voter fraud.</p>
                        <p>0:15:07 Peter: It is better for a million ballots to go uncounted than for one instance of voter fraud to go uncaught. That is the official position of the Fifth Circuit. By the way, we're getting in the swing of launching a merch store, so to our listeners, if there's any interest in maybe like a mug that just has the addresses of every Fifth Circuit judge on it, let us know, reach out.</p>
                        <p>0:15:36 Rhiannon: Yeah, we can send that to the artist for a design rendering.</p>
                        <p>0:15:41 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:15:41 Peter: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:15:41 Michael: Floor plans of their houses. Just decorative.</p>
                        <p>0:15:46 Peter: The weak points in their security systems.</p>
                        <p>0:15:50 Michael: All their pets' names, birthdays, kids' birthdays...</p>
                        <p>0:15:54 Peter: Their kids' school schedules and shit. Alright, so let's talk about other types of reform. Rhiannon, you told me that you were looking into jurisdiction stripping, and then I saw you tweeting that you were not doing that, so I'm interested to see whether you can dive into it right now.</p>
                        <p>0:16:12 Rhiannon: You see, some really important news dropped that distracted me, and I promise it was really, really important, like I said, really crucial that I spent time on it. Jeffrey Toobin has been jerking off during Zoom calls...</p>
                        <p>0:16:26 Michael: On Zoom, on Zoom.</p>
                        <p>0:16:27 Rhiannon: So yeah, so you know, I had to... You understand, I had to look at that.</p>
                        <p>0:16:32 Peter: That is important to us, because Toobin's a legal analyst at The New Yorker and appears on CNN, and obviously that could be us, so... It's drama, yes, but it's also a job opportunity.</p>
                        <p>0:16:44 Rhiannon: Yeah, call us up, The New Yorker. So some scholars, notably Samuel Moyn over at Yale, have been talking about Court reform proposals that could be enacted in conjunction with or in lieu of Court packing. One such option would be jurisdiction stripping. Now, this proposal would decrease the power of the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general, by basically writing into new legislation a provision that would say that the federal courts or the Supreme Court do not have jurisdiction to look at cases that come up under these new laws. So for example, if you could imagine a Green New Deal getting passed, somebody who wants to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction would propose that written into the Green New Deal, it would say the Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction to hear any cases that come up under this Green New Deal.</p>
                        <p>0:17:41 Peter: And does this actually work? I mean, I've heard this bounced around, but the sort of alternative position is that they are not meaningful, at least at some percentage of the time.</p>
                        <p>0:17:49 Michael: Yeah, the idea is like, I don't want to get into the details of fed court shit, but it's like the Supreme Court, its appellate jurisdiction and a lot of stuff is not mandatory under the Constitution and the lower courts don't even have to exist, so Congress can definitely strip the lower courts of this jurisdiction to hear this stuff. And then the Supreme Court would have nothing to hear an appeal from, there's no avenue for it to get to the Supreme Court. But I have faith that the committed combined intellect of the Federal Society and the Supreme Court Justices, if they took aim at the Green New Deal could find a way to get it in front of the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:18:29 Peter: That's the thing, like at the end of the day, jurisdiction is, in a lot of ways, theirs to claim. And once they do, you're saddled with the same problem, and that's why this has always sort of rang a little bit hollow to me, although I do find it interesting.</p>
                        <p>0:18:44 Rhiannon: Right. Another proposal for Court reform that would decrease Court power is a supermajority requirement. And what that means is that instead of five members of the Court being required to make a ruling to overturn important legislation from Congress, requiring a supermajority. So something like maybe six or eight members of the Court, or all nine would be required to overturn big bills from Congress. And the idea behind that is that not requiring a supermajority to overturn legislation is really anti-democratic. If the people have elected their representatives and representatives enact legislation that the people want, then it's really anti-democratic and it should be a sort of huge issue that warrants overturning that kind of legislation, not just the whims of just five people.</p>
                        <p>0:19:39 Peter: Yeah... Go ahead.</p>
                        <p>0:19:40 Michael: I was just going to say, I'm just really enjoying the imagery of like this Florida law professor, Jed Shugerman, who's written about this. And he had an article a little while ago about an alternate history of how different things would look if you had a six-vote requirement to overturn legislation, and just like right now, him going back and quietly changing it to like a seven requirement. He'd be like sweating and being like, "Fuck, my big idea. It's no longer that useful at all."</p>
                        <p>0:20:14 Peter: The real problem with the seven vote requirement or an eight vote requirement or a unanimous requirement, is that overturning legislation, meaning invalidating Congressional legislation, is a very, very, very small percentage of what the Supreme Court does. What they're usually doing is interpreting legislation, so if you imposed a supermajority requirement to invalidate a law, what they would do is instead of invalidating it, just interpret it in such a way that functionally invalidates it. Roberts didn't get rid of the ACA, but he got rid of Medicaid expansion. There are all these avenues they can take to hollow out important legislation without actually invalidating it, and that's why I think that this really, at the end of the day, gets us not nowhere, but not so far at all.</p>
                        <p>0:21:03 Michael: Also of questionable constitutional character and something that I think you would get far more pushback on from the Court than even jurisdiction stripping. It would be one of the toughest sells, I think the Court would bristle at Congress dictating to it what it can and can't do.</p>
                        <p>0:21:21 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think it's important to note that both of those reform proposals, jurisdiction stripping and the possible requirement of a supermajority to invalidate legislation, both of those proposals kind of don't work without other reforms. They would need to be in conjunction with other sort of massive Court reforms, namely, again, Court packing. Even scholars like Samuel Moyn recognized that saying, with the inevitable confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, in the short term, the necessity and urgency of Court packing is pretty obvious even to people who are saying, no, we shouldn't just be Court packing, we should be looking at decreasing the overall power of the Court and reforming the Court that way.</p>
                        <p>0:22:06 Rhiannon: I wanted to quote Samuel Moyn and a co-author, Ryan Doerfler, wrote a long piece about Court reform and decreasing Court power from that perspective in The New Republic, and they say: "We must set about reforming the Supreme Court by reducing its authority, not praying that its Justices will somehow refrain from using it. No other course of action is equal to the urgent crises and the democratic imperative of our present." And they kind of note throughout the piece the sort of perilousness and precarity of the welfare state, which has been kind of laid bare with the pandemic and economic inequality, that basically what that is going to require from Democrats as a response is massive sweeping legislation that they argue is basically unprecedented.</p>
                        <p>0:22:58 Rhiannon: And the Court in its current form is literally constructed to invalidate, it's an inherently reactionary institution, and it's an anti-majoritarian institution, so there just has to be a recognition and sort of an incorporation into Court reform measures that we are decreasing the power of the Court along with maybe changing its make-up.</p>
                        <p>0:23:23 Michael: Right, right, and I appreciate that, because one thing that I've been thinking about the entire time we've been recording is this debate in academic and legal and political circles right now about expanding versus disempowering the Court. I just feel like this is a conversation that is like 10 15, 20 years too late, like the time to have this conversation was after five unelected life-tenured politicians said in unequivocal terms that they choose partisan ideology over allegiance to democracy, and the rule of law in Bush v. Gore, literally stopped the vote counting to pick the president. That's what they did. That was the time to be like, maybe we should start thinking about reforming the Court.</p>
                        <p>0:24:10 Peter: What about this, then, Michael, tell me if this changes your mind, 'cause I just thought of a type of reform.</p>
                        <p>0:24:15 Michael: Okay.</p>
                        <p>0:24:16 Peter: Okay, alright. In both chambers and during oral arguments, they have to stand the whole time, no sitting.</p>
                        <p>0:24:23 Rhiannon: The judges do, the Justices do?</p>
                        <p>0:24:26 Peter: Yeah, yeah, if you sit, you're off the case. That's it.</p>
                        <p>0:24:26 Michael: Off the Court.</p>
                        <p>0:24:27 Peter: Well, that would be unconstitutional.</p>
                        <p>0:24:28 Michael: They have life tenure. No, life tenured...</p>
                        <p>0:24:31 Peter: No, okay, under good behavior...</p>
                        <p>0:24:33 Michael: No, life tenured as long as they're in good behavior, but you can just buy legislation, good behavior requires them to be standing.</p>
                        <p>0:24:38 Peter: I think this is a good idea.</p>
                        <p>0:24:41 Michael: They ought to be standing.</p>
                        <p>0:24:42 Peter: This was my second idea. My first was like sort of literal Floor as lava situation. I think the standing thing works, I think it's constitutional.</p>
                        <p>0:24:52 Rhiannon: You could jump these three couches to the bench, and the floor is literally lava, then cool. You get to be on the Court for life.</p>
                        <p>0:25:01 Peter: Imagine Clarence Thomas just having to stand there.</p>
                        <p>0:25:01 Michael: But yeah, so look, obviously Bush v. Gore was a big watershed. I think also 2010, Citizens United was a case that something like 70% to 80% of Republicans dislike, independents dislike. It was hugely controversial. Barack Obama was talking about it in the State of the Union, and Sam Alito was saying, "You lied." There was a time, that was a beautiful time for the academic and legal left to be like, let's talk about Supreme Court, let's have an agenda for disempowering the Supreme Court. But they didn't. And it's fucking cowardly. Nobody wants to be the person who's like first through the gate, saying, we have a real problem and we need to think about making big changes because you could be ridiculed, maybe you're not invited back on CNN, if you're saying that the Supreme Court has abandoned democracy and blah, blah.</p>
                        <p>0:25:54 Michael: But that moment's passed, like too much has happened in the last 15 years, and we've talked a lot about it, Citizens United, the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, just two off the top of my head that are like big issues. But it's no longer the case that we just need to fix the Supreme Court, we have to undo the damage they've done, that's going to require exercising power from the Supreme Court itself as a seat of power. We no longer just need to disempower it, we need to make use of it it. There's just no viable left project without it.</p>
                        <p>0:26:31 Rhiannon: I think that's exactly right, and I also... The lack of intellectual honesty and just intellectual engagement on this issue, I put a lot of that on law schools. I mean, the three of us went to three different law schools.</p>
                        <p>0:26:46 Peter: Yale, Harvard and Stanford for our listeners.</p>
                        <p>0:26:47 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:26:49 Rhiannon: Not true, but okay.</p>
                        <p>0:26:52 Michael: That was me, I transferred from when I... I was never happy.</p>
                        <p>0:26:54 Rhiannon: Yeah, 1L at Harvard,  2L at Yale, 3L at Stanford.</p>
                        <p>0:27:00 Michael: I couldn't find the place that was really challenging enough.</p>
                        <p>0:27:02 Rhiannon: Right, that's right. Michael's only one on the pod for whom that's a halfway believable statement. Anyway, but yeah, I put a lot of this on law schools, we went to law school, we know how this stuff is taught, it's wholesale acceptance of the status quo, and I've only realized now looking back how intellectually lazy that is and how...</p>
                        <p>0:27:26 Peter: It's beyond acceptance of the status quo.</p>
                        <p>0:27:28 Michael: It's reification.</p>
                        <p>0:27:29 Peter: Yes, exactly, and it's treatment of the status quo as if it is sort of...</p>
                        <p>0:27:32 Rhiannon: As if it's the ideal.</p>
                        <p>0:27:34 Peter: Not just the ideal, but as if it's organic, as if it's something that pre-exists and you have to sort of work with it.</p>
                        <p>0:27:41 Rhiannon: Right, right. And that kind of abdication of intellectual responsibility in the legal education system across the board is super concerning too.</p>
                        <p>0:27:52 Michael: Yeah, I think there's a level of like... I don't know if it's cowardice or naivety or both. I'm not saying this about like Moyn, through a lot of the current clever alternatives to Court packing, people who didn't want to own up to what was going on 10 years ago, and don't really want to own up to what's going on now either, but are having to give some ground in the face of reality, kind of like, well, fuck, like the head-in-the-sand routine only works so long, but they're still not ready to fully embrace the facts on the ground, what this project has been from the right wing, from their colleagues that are in the Federal Society, and who they lunch with or whatever.</p>
                        <p>0:28:32 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah, and I'm so glad that you brought up, Michael, that this stuff was obvious, it was obvious 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, and it's a simple thing that we say a lot, which is like, learn from history. When fascism comes to the country, it doesn't announce itself as fascism. It never does, right. And also, I think people assume like, well, if things were bad and this was fascism or whatever, if there's too much power consolidated in the few, then things would be really, really bad for everybody, or I don't know where the line is for some people, right, but just a reminder that fascism leads to good results for a few people, like some people are doing really well.</p>
                        <p>0:29:14 Peter: Sometimes for a plurality of the population.</p>
                        <p>0:29:16 Rhiannon: Right, exactly, exactly. And so I don't know where the line is for people to start being concerned about it and really engage intellectually and creatively in what needs to be done with federal courts, but yeah, it was obvious. The line was passed on for me a long time ago.</p>
                        <p>0:29:34 Peter: Alright, let's circle back to some reforms, and there's one that we had talked about before, which has been floated by a bunch of prominent voices on the left, that you just could ignore the Court. The idea here is that the Constitution doesn't grant the Court the final say on constitutional issues, the Court granted itself that power in Marbury v. Madison, a case from 1803, that leads to a very weird part of law school where early on you learn that the Court doesn't really have the power to bind any one on constitutional issues and its entire role in society is built on what everyone more or less agrees is a false premise. And then you just move on and do the rest of law school like that didn't just happen.</p>
                        <p>0:30:14 Rhiannon: It's like you said before, the Court sort of builds its jurisdiction and then takes it.</p>
                        <p>0:30:18 Peter: Yeah, this is very similar to jurisdiction stripping, but it doesn't require a provision in a law, it just requires that either Congress or the Executive Branch or both ignore the Court's rulings and say thanks for the tips, but no thanks. And the Court has no inherent enforcement powers, those enforcement powers rest within the Executive Branch, so if the Executive Branch isn't playing ball, that's it. The nice part of this is that you sort of side step one of the biggest problems with Court reform, because this doesn't need to be legislation, so you don't need buy-in from congressional Democrats. This can be effectively done without consensus, that's the big plus on this idea.</p>
                        <p>0:30:55 Peter: The Supreme Court strikes down a law or a regulation and people just carry on like it didn't happen, and you don't need to worry about getting every fucking centrist Democratic hack on board. I think that's very alluring, and I always circle back to the Green New Deal as an example of where it would be most effective. Like Congress passes this necessary and urgent legislation and the Court tries to invalidate it or whatever, and there's a point at which we may not have time to fuck around with trying to deal with the Court's bullshit, you need the legislation implemented ASAP, etcetera. I think that's pretty compelling.</p>
                        <p>0:31:29 Michael: Yeah, we can imagine something where the Court strikes down some regulations under the Green New Deal, and then it's hard to imagine actually President Biden doing this, but his EPA or whatever, somebody just being like, okay, and then just reissuing the regulations. And like continuing to enforce them and continuing to fine companies that were not in compliance with them and whatever, just going full steam ahead, and being like, well, what the fuck are you going to do about it, John Roberts?</p>
                        <p>0:31:55 Peter: So yeah, the problems with this are kind of varied and complex, we talked about this in the listener Q&A episode, but one conceptual issue here is that the Court doesn't derive its power from Marbury v. Madison. Power doesn't come from Supreme Court decisions, it comes from a network of norms and institutions embedded in our government and in our society, but yes, the Supreme Court technically doesn't have any enforcement power, it essentially relies on the cooperation of the Executive Branch, so if there's full-fledged consensus within the Executive Branch to ignore the Court, this could be done. If not, though, if not everyone agreed about this, there might be a lot of chaos and internal tension, etcetera.</p>
                        <p>0:32:33 Peter: And I think -- I brought this up in the Q&A episode too -- and I think it's the most important issue, signaling to state governments that they are effectively unconstrained by the federal constitution, that feels like a nightmare. Now, the federal government could try to enforce Court decisions against the states, but if it was also ignoring decisions from the same Court, that feels like an issue, and it feels like the inevitable stand-off between the feds and insane state-level Republican governments, which seems pretty high risk. Like we're talking about people who think Joe Biden is about to do communism in America. If you fucking... If Biden's administration started ignoring the Supreme Court, what would state governments do in response? I think that's something that you need to really seriously consider.</p>
                        <p>z Peter: This brings us to Court packing, or Court expansion, as we're now saying in order to make MSNBC viewers less nervous.</p>
                        <p>0:33:30 Rhiannon: Does that feel better?</p>
                        <p>0:33:31 Peter: Is our preferred reform, because it gets to the heart of the issue. The issue is the Supreme Court is comprised of reactionary nut jobs. The only way to negate their power is to add Justices who have better politics and dilute the influence of the Court's conservatives. You don't tinker with the rules, you don't try to contain the power of the Court, you make it an active and powerful force for good. It takes the power and the political significance of the Court and weaponizes it in favor of left liberal interests. That's why this is by far the best option available to us, everything else is effectively a half-measure. To use a flawless metaphor, there's a conservative Court and it's shooting at you at this very moment. Do you want to pass legislation banning guns, or do you want a Steven Segal to grab that gun and turn it around in the Court and unload? There's a clear choice here.</p>
                        <p>0:34:29 Michael: I metaphorically want to unload the gun.</p>
                        <p>0:34:35 Peter: That was a good metaphor, right?</p>
                        <p>0:34:36 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Total metaphor.</p>
                        <p>0:34:38 Michael: Yeah. And I think sometimes the divide... We've talked about it this way, and I think it's sort of framed this way often by people on both sides as a divide between people who are interested in sort of like a good governance perspective, like, I want government to work right, I want the Court to work well, I want this to be whatever, like things to function well versus like I want robust left power. But I don't think that those two things are mutually exclusive, and I think actually the Court functioning well is thinking about this too myopically. If you want the government to function well, if you want good governance, that also requires things like campaign finance reform, we need to get money back out of politics, and that means like we can't run away from Citizens United, right? Fixing our elections, re-passing the Voting Rights Act, passing a better, more robust Voting Rights Act. What would make the federal government work better requires a Supreme Court that has good politics that is ready to back your Voting Rights Act or campaign finance reform, all your other good governance shit. We're dealing with a Court that has been slowly tilted to the right bit by bit for 40 years, and if we want good government and we want just outcomes, it means filling the Court with people with a clear vision that aligns with ours, and who are willing to act on that vision.</p>
                        <p>0:36:10 Peter: So let's talk about the politics of this a bit. I think the big open question is pretty obvious, can Democrats rally the political support necessary to do any or all of this? Obviously, it'll probably take a bit more to get Court packing through than it would Ro Khanna's term limits proposal, and there's something to be said for a reform that can actually pass, but this is the moment. Republicans openly and shamelessly strong-armed a seat on the Court. They held up Merrick Garland, they put in Neil Gorsuch, they didn't extend the same favor to RBG's seat, so it should be considered fair game to at least get that back. And I think that mainstream Democrats see that, that's a good sign that Biden hasn't ruled it out, though I'm not confident about him driving an openly partisan power grab. Another good sign is that Republicans seem to be incredibly nervous. And I think they've proposed legislation to stop this, which wouldn't work, by the way, it could just be repealed or overridden by subsequent laws.</p>
                        <p>0:37:09 Michael: I do want to say, I think the Republicans are fucking up the politics of this, I know political punditry not our lane.</p>
                        <p>0:37:15 Peter: No, it's not anyone's, it's a fake lane, so let's just hop right in.</p>
                        <p>0:37:19 Michael: It is, so let's fucking do it. Let's do it. Court reform is not something that Joe Biden was excited to get behind. He was comfortably nursing like an 8 point, 9 point lead in the polls and trying to keep the race steady. Court reform was sort of thrust on him in part by circumstances by Amy Coney Barrett and activist Democrats. It doesn't poll that great, it polls roughly when you pair it next to confirming Amy Coney Barrett the same, like people don't think that they should confirm her, and they don't think that they should expand the Court. It's the Republicans are trying to tie Democrats down into this right now, trying to get them on record and harassing Joe Biden about it, 'cause they think maybe it'll help them on the margins electorally, but all they're doing really is putting Democrats in a position where they can't fucking depress their base right now.</p>
                        <p>0:38:14 Michael: So they have to at least nod towards it, they have to at least say it's on the table, if not, come out and be like, you know what, yeah. And they're pushing Democrats into this corner where they have to at least be open to it, and they're creating a situation where Democrats might end up with a very large electoral win because of COVID, because of a recession, because of a lot of things that have nothing to do with the Supreme Court, but nonetheless will have a mandate for reforming and possibly expanding the Court. Like they are putting it front and center in the election right now because they think it might help them on the margin, but all they're doing is creating a situation where there's going to be a mandate for this. I thank them for that.</p>
                        <p>0:38:54 Peter: Yeah, I agree. One thing we can expect if talk of reform gets loud enough is that you may see the Court and Roberts especially try to protect itself by moderating a bit, they side with the liberals on a few key issues, and essentially they say, look, see, nothing to worry. We are the fair and impartial Court that you always dreamed about. Now, a couple of things on that. First of all, it is to some degree obviously a bluff. The vast majority of the Court's rulings will still be conservative and they'll tack harder right if they get the opportunity. Second though, this is why the sincere threat of Court reform is so important, even if it doesn't come to pass, the Court is pressured to start moderating. A lot of people tout the independence of the Court, as if it's like this inherently and unequivocally good thing, but this is an example of how beneficial it could be for the Court to be susceptible to political and institutional pressure. The law has political implications, so some matter of responsiveness to the body politic, no matter how indirect, makes sense.</p>
                        <p>0:39:53 Michael: A perfect example of this, I think, is the case that just at the time of this recording just came down, which was the appeal the Supreme Court heard from the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court. And so this was an issue that had to do with deadlines related to mail-in ballots, and Pennsylvania law required that mail-in ballots be received by election day, and because of delays with the mail and because of the influx of mail ballot requests because of COVID, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said, you gotta extend that, this is burdensome on the right to vote. And so instead of receiving the ballots by election day, what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said was our state constitutional right to vote requires that at the very least they have to be able to send their ballots by election day. Anything received within three days of the election, we'll say was mailed by election day.</p>
                        <p>0:40:48 Michael: And Republicans challenged that 'cause they said that this was an intolerable risk that people will cast ballots on Wednesday or Thursday after the election and have it received on time and counted.</p>
                        <p>0:41:01 Peter: That is the greatest offense to democracy when you cast your vote a day late.</p>
                        <p>0:41:07 Michael: The biggest fear.</p>
                        <p>0:41:07 Peter: After the shock Glock.</p>
                        <p>0:41:11 Michael: And so they were very concerned about this, they appealed it to the Supreme Court, and they put a lot of arguments forward. The most extreme one was that this was an unconstitutional erogation of the legislature's power to set the terms of the election, because the Federal Constitution delegates the power of the time, place and manner of elections to state legislators, and if the Supreme Court came down and put their thumb on the scale and accepted this argument going forward, it would allow for a lot of malfeasance from state legislatures, which are like often gerrymandered to shit by a bunch of craven careerist assholes or idiots, both parties, but especially Republicans, so like putting them in a special place in the constitutional order.</p>
                        <p>0:41:56 Michael: It's very scary. This case, the Supreme Court, they split 4-4. So it's a pretty strong indicator of just how eager Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Alito and Thomas are to step in at the most extreme reaches of their power to help out Republicans in this election. And Amy Coney Barret is ripe to join the Court. But Justice Roberts joined the liberals and realizes that if they had come out right now 5 to 3 and invalidated a Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruling based on Pennsylvania State Supreme Court grounds over Pennsylvania State Law, to make voting more difficult, essentially telegraphing to the Democratic Party that there is no limit to the degree to which the Supreme Court would be unwilling to go to help Republicans win this or any other election, you could basically guarantee that Court reform and probably, I think, Court packing would be happening if Democrats win. There's like no way that you'd get around that.</p>
                        <p>0:43:06 Peter: Right, we've mentioned before, Roberts on voting rights is Roberts at his most conservative, so him deviating here, like immediate red flags, like he's doing something. He's telling people and politicians who may be considering packing the Court, look, don't worry, the Court as it is, is eminently reasonable and moderate.</p>
                        <p>0:43:25 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. We should also though be taking seriously that the four conservatives on the Court, and certainly Amy Coney Barrett when she joins them, are so not concerned with the politics of this moment and the Supreme Court losing power, that they are willing to do something this extreme, right.</p>
                        <p>0:43:42 Michael: Right, I already consider myself like somewhat of a Court packing maximalist, right, who's like, we should expand it to 15, so it'll 9 liberals to 6 conservatives. I was thinking about this today before this case dropped, and I was like, man, if they overturn the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, fuck like 15, it should be like 21, 25, like, fuck these guys, they should be nothing. I was literally like, should I write a Medium post about it, like what should I do to circulate this idea? And I think that Robert gets that, this could be very galvanizing moment.</p>
                        <p>0:44:19 Peter: Yeah, so to wrap this up, these are all the reasons that we side with Court packing, right. It's not about tinkering with the institutional power of the Supreme Court, it should be about gaining power for the left and utilizing it to the best of our ability. So we'll leave it here for now and move on to our interview with Congressman Ro Khanna. We're going to talk about his bill as well as some of these other reform ideas we've been discussing. One quick note about this interview is it was recorded after the confirmation hearings were over, but while the confirmation process was still very much under way, so you might hear some of that in how we talk about the Democrat strategy. So I think we're probably going to take a quick ad break and then we're going to talk to Ro.</p>
                        <p>0:45:07 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:45:07 Peter: Alright, Congressman Ro Khanna, thanks for joining us, man.</p>
                        <p>0:45:15 Ro Khanna: Great to be on.</p>
                        <p>0:45:15 Rhiannon: Yes, thank you for being here.</p>
                        <p>0:45:17 Peter: We do this podcast with the broad goal of critiquing the Court from a left progressive perspective and sort of demystifying the Court and its role in society, and we view the Court as it's currently composed as a very ideologically conservative institution. So we were pleasantly surprised to see calls for reform coming from the halls of Congress. You've proposed an 18-year term limit on future Supreme Court Justices. So first things first, we want you to tell us a little bit about the bill, what it says, and what you're hoping to accomplish with it.</p>
                        <p>0:45:54 Ro Khanna: Well, Peter, thanks for having me. Our Framers never intended people to be on the Court for 30 or 40 years, and what we currently have is a previous generation making laws for a contemporary generation, it's actually quite anti-democratic. The Framers' intent when they said people should be there for life was an assumption that people would go on the Court at the end of their careers for five years, 10 years as sort of a capstone to their service, not that there would be gaming in terms of getting people on at a very young age so that they could have a long tenure. And the Constitution says that a judge has to be there for life so that you don't have the whims of politics influencing them, but the Constitution nowhere says that a judge has to be on the Supreme Court for life.</p>
                        <p>0:46:43 Ro Khanna: So what our bill says is that a judge can be a Justice for 18 years. After they've done their service, they can then go on to a circuit court or a lower court and continue to be a judge. They just don't have to continue on the Supreme Court. And every president would get two appointments in their term, so you wouldn't have this oddity where some presidents get zero appointments and other presidents get three appointments, and you wouldn't have a national drama every time we have a Supreme Court vacancy. The idea is actually not to be partisan, it's just to be common sense and to restore the Court to what its original purpose was.</p>
                        <p>0:47:22 Peter: Right, and so I want to talk about the constitutionality of it just a little bit, at least. So the Constitution says that they shall hold "their offices during good behavior," meaning essentially for life. I think when you read that, it seems to imply a single office. I imagine that your argument is that because the bill applies only the future Justices, the term "their office" is a little more flexible than that, that it could mean something that involves them stepping down to a lower court at a given time. We don't have to get into the details of the constitutionality, but there is sort of a tension here, because this might have to get 5 votes at the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:48:00 Ro Khanna: It might be 7.</p>
                        <p>0:48:04 Peter: I guess my question is, is there a real concern in your mind that the five Justices of the Supreme Court just strike this down?</p>
                        <p>0:48:10 Ro Khanna: Well, there is a concern, of course, about what the Court would do. Your point about the office, one other option is that you could have someone go senior on the Supreme Court, not be able to actually adjudicate on the Supreme Court decisions, but from senior status get to choose what circuit court they want to sit on, so there are ways of framing this that would, in my view, pass constitutional muster.</p>
                        <p>0:48:33 Ro Khanna: Now, John Roberts, the Chief Justice, in 1983 actually came out for term limits, and here's my view, I think many more people on the Court would be amenable to term limits then they would to the expansion of the Court, so you could see the pressure building on them to say, okay, let's take this option, this option is better than the calls for expansion. And maybe that leads to them holding it constitutional; though, no one knows what they would find until it was actually litigated.</p>
                        <p>0:49:06 Rhiannon: Right, yeah. And Congressman, I'm going to jump in, I think, I'm glad that you brought up the proposal of term limits sort of decreasing the political whims and the politicization currently of Supreme Court nominees. A big benefit, I think, in the idea of term limits is that it creates predictable institutional norms. Right now, lifetime appointments mean that there's literally life and death urgency sometimes around appointments to the Supreme Court and the confirmation process being this politicized and frenzied, it leads to a lot of norm breaking. Predictable vacancies definitely cut against that, but I'm also thinking about a potential pitfall that the term limit proposal actually might have, which is increased politicization.</p>
                        <p>0:49:48 Rhiannon: We can foresee then, for instance, a Supreme Court Justice planning to run for political office after the end of their term. For example, former Supreme Court Justice Peter plans to run for governor, right? So towards the end of the Justices' terms, we would need to be looking out for campaigning in their decision-making, conflicts of interest, that kind of thing. What do you think about the potential of creating this whole new moral hazard in politicizing the work of being a Justice?</p>
                        <p>0:50:16 Ro Khanna: Rhiannon, that's actually an excellent point, and one could look at whether you could prevent someone from seeking political office after being on the Court. Of course, nothing would prevent someone from doing that today. You could see Justice Roberts saying, I want to resign and run for governor or president, so you would have that option today. I guess you would aggravate it if people didn't think that being a senior status would allow for sufficient prestige, you'd want to have a culture where that was very much frowned upon. And then if people really were doing it, then one could look at some legislation saying you have to have some time of separation before doing that and being on the Court, and you would have to look at the constitutionality of it.</p>
                        <p>0:51:10 Michael: Right, it sounds like what you're saying is that these are political questions that demand political answers, legislation and congressional involvement, which I think philosophically we agree with.</p>
                        <p>0:51:22 Peter: Yeah, our general position on term limits is they would be nice, but they don't solve a larger and more immediate problem, the immediate problem being that we're right now on the verge of a 6-3 conservative majority with the six conservatives ranging from young to not particularly old, and your bill proposes that future justices would have the limit applied to them. But the conservative Court right now and for the next 10 to 15 years or so is poised to undo reproductive choice protections, continue to assault voting rights, undermine progressive legislation like a potential Green New Deal, dismantle workers' rights, on and on and on. So I think term limits are a very viable and sensible reform, but even if you snapped your fingers and pass edit, we're saddled with this Court.</p>
                        <p>0:52:10 Peter: So there's a question of what reforms could actually tackle that issue more directly. Are you sort of supportive of other options and the big one that you mentioned is Court expansion. Is that something you consider to be on the table in your view or is that a step too far?</p>
                        <p>0:52:26 Ro Khanna: Well, Peter, first, there are other proposals on term limits, for example, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who's a constitutional scholar, was working on term limits that actually would apply to the current Justices, and he has an argument for why he thinks that could be constitutional. I think it's a harder argument, but a possible argument, and I haven't studied it enough, but that could be one way of going, is to say then, no, it should apply to the current Justices. And again, you could see a Justice Roberts who cares so much about the legitimacy of the Court preferring that to potential expansion. I think Court reform has to be open to all considerations, but I don't think that that means Court packing, I don't think that you just have a Democratic president get in and then say, okay, we're going to pack the Court with ideological people who we like.</p>
                        <p>0:53:17 Ro Khanna: I think that what a Democratic president can do is appoint a commission to study all of the different Court reform options and look at the different scholars who have proposed different options for Court reform, and then should make a decision that could lead to a more legitimate depoliticized Court that also is capable of dealing with the increased caseload and see where things lead. But I think that's very different than the Court packing that Roosevelt tried in the 1930s.</p>
                        <p>0:53:46 Peter: Yeah, I think there's a distinction to be made here between different types of Court reform. Some, like term limits, are sort of tinkering with the machinations of the Court to make them fairer and maybe less susceptible to politics in the general sense. But I think that's separate from reforms that address the fact that as it stands right now, the Court is too conservative. I think in our view, in my view, the only real fix to that is one way or another, more left-leaning Justices. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean Court packing, but it certainly would mean either Court packing or the replacement of current conservative Justices with left-leaning Justices. I think the question is, when it comes to more timid institutional reforms is, do we have that kind of time in the next five years if Roe v. Wade is really at stake, which it seems like it is.</p>
                        <p>0:54:37 Peter: If we have a Green New Deal that has the potential to be gutted by a conservative Court, we don't know exactly how yet, but certainly it's something that could happen, do you think that we should be looking to increase the number of left-leaning liberal Justices on the Court? Is the real problem in your view that the Court is inherently institutionally unfair or is it that the Court is too conservative?</p>
                        <p>0:55:00 Ro Khanna: Well, they're two different issues. One is that it's institutionally problematic, and that needs to be solved, and the second issue is, as a person of my own political persuasion, what do I think of the Court? And obviously, I think that the Court is too conservative. I guess the one thing I would say is that with the Lochner Court in the 1930s, there was a change in the Court, and that change came because the Court itself didn't want to lose its legitimacy and be deeply out of step with public opinion, and that they realized where the New Deal was going, and they did not want to be an anti-majoritarian body. And so the question is, if you have a conversation about Court reform and making sure that the Court is legitimate and responsive in some sense to the popular will, though, of course, adhering to the Constitution, does that give sufficient pause to Justices that they would blatantly exercise anti-democratic unconstitutional interpretations?</p>
                        <p>0:56:02 Ro Khanna: I think it's an open question, 'cause you've seen with Roberts that he has been unwilling to strike down the ACA, unwilling to take the certain measures, very much concerned about the legitimacy of the Court. So could it be that you would have a Court totally indifferent to being anti-majoritarian? You could, and in which case, you may need to have other remedies. But I guess I would first approach things with a genuine effort at Court reform that did have commission, that did have a bipartisan buy-in or some sense of fairness that was beyond ideological, and see if that works and see where that leads us.</p>
                        <p>0:56:43 Michael: So when I hear that, I get kind of flashbacks to 2009, which to me was like a time when Barack Obama just won this big convincing victory, Democrats had the supermajority in the Senate and massive majorities in the House and spent months trying to convince a few Republicans whose whole legislative platform had been resoundingly rejected at the polls to get on board with their healthcare plan and give it some bipartisan support and make it look legitimate and make the process seem fair, and in the process, diluted the bill, made it less strong and less faithful to what the party had run on, and the result was a weaker bill with benefits that were delayed, it hurt the party politically. We didn't get a single Republican vote for it. So the lesson I took from that was, when you have power, you gotta use it, you gotta use it to do things to make people's lives better.</p>
                        <p>0:57:42 Peter: Right, if I can build on this, 'cause I think the Court in the '30s is kind of instructive here. It's true that the Court saw the risk of really aggressive institutional reform and then sort of moderated on FDR's New Deal policies, but that came with the real serious and sincere threat by FDR of packing the Court. Isn't there a risk, if you go at this with an approach of sort of starting from a non-partisan perspective, that the Court doesn't really feel that same pressure, they're not at the barrel of a gun like the Court in the '30s was.</p>
                        <p>0:58:16 Ro Khanna: Both very thoughtful counter-arguments, Michael and Peter. Let me say a couple of things. First, I agree with you, Michael, in terms of that we should have gone bigger in 2009, we needed double the stimulus, and Paul Krugman was screaming about that, Christina Romer was screaming about that, and Rahm Emanuel saying, well, find me the 60 votes in the Senate was a mistake, we should have just done that on 51 votes. I have no doubt that if we win and we can get policies passed on 51 votes, we should do that and we should go bold and we should try to get the American people the help they need. And of course, I'm for Medicare for All and free public college, and for the Green New Deal and bold policies.</p>
                        <p>0:58:52 Ro Khanna: I think, though, that is a different question than the question of the Supreme Court, because the Supreme Court, I think people see that as not just ordinary politics, but to the interpretation of the Constitution. And the question is, okay, well, are we going to have an FDR-like victory? Perhaps if we have an FDR-like victory, and then the Court is acting in an anti-democratic way, the argument becomes very clear. But let's say we have a victory where you have a 20-person majority in the House, and a two-person majority in the Senate and a president, that's not quite an FDR landslide, I guess my inclination would be pursue a policy that could get Court reform with the buy-in of a larger number of people, so you just don't have the loss of that reform four years later.</p>
                        <p>0:59:45 Ro Khanna: Let's see if that works. If it doesn't work, and if you have the Congress passing Medicare for All, or the Congress passing some policy that the Court is striking down, or the Court over-ruling Roe v. Wade in a way that strikes people as totally unjust, then you can always look at other options.</p>
                        <p>1:00:04 Rhiannon: I'm glad that you brought in sort of the buy-in from the party, 'cause I'd like to zoom out maybe just a little bit. We know how you feel about this, we know about your bill, but just thinking about the party maybe a little bit more. It's clear that Republicans have played what is most politely described as hard ball with Supreme Court seats. And I think there's a lot of concern on the left that Democrats just don't have the same level of gamesmanship in them. Between the Merrick Garland debacle, the Kavanaugh hearings, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's rapid replacement now, a lot of people seem to be eyeing more aggressive response from Democrats. Do you have a sense that there's really an appetite among the Democrats for Court expansion, for the whole host of options on the table for aggressive Court reform?</p>
                        <p>1:00:52 Ro Khanna: Well, first, I definitely think we need to be more aggressive in the opposition of Amy Coney Barrett. Senator Feinstein is giving Judge Barrett a hug at the end of the hearings and asking her to speak about her family. I just don't think that that's reflective of the sentiment in our country, it's not that I... Look, Judge Barrett is a perfectly decent person and probably a very thoughtful professor, but she's coming to the Senate in a process that most of us believe is illegitimate, and those kind of gestures I think legitimize her presence, and I believe we should have either boycotted the hearing or done things to make it clearer that this was an illegitimate power grab.</p>
                        <p>1:01:46 Ro Khanna: Going forward, I think there are going to be many, many people in the party, moderates, progressives, even centrists, who are going to be committed to Court reform. Now, what that looks like, I think remains to be seen. I believe one of the key voices on this question is going to be Eric Holder, he's done a lot of thinking about the issue, he's highly respected among progressives, he's highly respected amongst people who served in the Obama administration, he doesn't have any particular agenda, he's sort of already served at the highest levels of government, and I could see someone like him, I can see the Vice President Biden tasking him with presenting options for Court reform and seeing how he can build broad consensus among the party.</p>
                        <p>1:02:29 Peter: Yeah, we don't agree that Amy Coney Barret is a great person.</p>
                        <p>1:02:33 Michael: But otherwise, preach.</p>
                        <p>1:02:35 Peter: Otherwise, we're right there with you, yeah.</p>
                        <p>1:02:39 Michael: So something you mentioned about personalizing this to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell especially, and the hypocrisy and just this conversation in general has me thinking about, is that talking about term limits and reforms in general, sometimes we talk about the legitimacy of the institution, and I think that's right, but it also seems like we're also talking about Republican reform in a way, like how can we get them to stop acting like insane assholes about the Court. That's what it feels like this conversation is about, at least at some level. But isn't the answer to that just that you gotta just beat them really, really resoundingly and lock them out of power until they're... Find a better way? I don't know.</p>
                        <p>1:03:18 Ro Khanna: Michael, it's not an irrational response of why the Republicans are so focused on the Court. If you believe that we have demographic change in this country, which I do, if you believe that we're moving towards a multi-cultural, multi-racial democracy, which I do, if you believe that young people are for progressive policies like Medicare for All, like the Green New Deal, and you're a conservative and you see that coming, what can you do? You know that you're probably not going to be able to win presidential elections on a conservative platform, you're probably not going to be able to win the House or Senate on a conservative platform, so the one check to progressive advancement is the Court, and I think that that is why they have been so focused on that to try to entrench the current ideology of the nation, or even an ideology going back 20, 30 years, for this century, despite the Democratic will.</p>
                        <p>1:04:18 Ro Khanna: Now, I believe, I guess I have enough faith in American democracy that I think it would be very, very hard for a Court to have legitimacy if they actually start striking down popular legislation, and so far, they haven't done that with the Affordable Care Act, though they may with a 6-3 vote. And I do think that a crisis could emerge and we have to be prepared for that.</p>
                        <p>1:04:40 Michael: Yeah. I think for us, we look at something like Shelby County and the Voting Rights Act and see already the start of striking down a different sort of popular legislation, maybe one that doesn't hit people's pocket books in the same way.</p>
                        <p>1:04:53 Peter: And maybe this goes to another issue, which is just that if you leave the conservatives on the Court and hope that they will be influenced by reform, there's a risk that what they do is rule in such a way that functionally guts, for example, a lot of progressive legislation, but optically isn't so bad. The Shelby County decision is hard to explain to the average person. What they have done to undermine the ACA without dismantling it entirely is hard to explain to the average person and has given John Roberts a lot of leeway and maybe the ability to say that he's operating in good faith to a degree that he might not be. This isn't really a question as much as I will say that if what seems to be happening in the next year or so, over the next term, especially if Biden wins, is at the Court shifts center very nominally in a way that it appears to be designed by John Roberts to be for optics. Please don't buy that, please.</p>
                        <p>1:05:49 Rhiannon: Begging you.</p>
                        <p>1:05:49 Ro Khanna: No, I hear that, no I hear that. And you're right. Look, the gutting of voting rights is a huge deal, because again, this is part of the effort to forestall the emerging new majority in this country, and you have, I think, strategists who understand that issues of getting people off the voter rolls that these are essential strategies to hold on to power.</p>
                        <p>1:06:17 Michael: Absolutely. So we're a Supreme Court-focused podcast, and we've been talking about Supreme Court reform, obviously, but would be remiss if we didn't at least ask about lower court reform. It's been about 40 years since the lower courts have been expanded last. I think it was 1980 and 1982. It seems like they're due... It seems like it's both good housekeeping at this point, given the loads a lot of these district and appellate courts have and good ideologically, given how much, like Mitch McConnell, how many vacancies he held open at the lower levels. Do you have any sense that there's any appetite for that sort of reform as well, adding a new circuit or two and expanding the district courts, adding 100, 150 district courts, that sort of thing?</p>
                        <p>1:07:01 Ro Khanna: Yes, I think that there's an administrative need to look at the caseload on district courts, to look at the case load on circuit courts. That's something that happens all the time in Congress. Frankly, some of the scariest appointments in this Trump administration have been to district courts and circuit courts, where you have people who are literally cronies, who have not had any academic background, though that's not always as important as your moral compass, but you literally have political hacks in some of these positions, which is a real, real concern. And so I definitely think that we need to look at where that expansion makes sense, and we also have to keep an eye on judges who are blatantly lawless, if they are not doing their basic jobs. It's one thing to disagree on interpretation of case law, and we should fight that, it's another thing if people are just not applying the law.</p>
                        <p>1:08:02 Michael: Right, yeah, absolutely. It's hard to explain the current Affordable Care Act case to the layman, but it is... I think it's like lawless. I think it's crazy that any judge has signed on to it, and the fact that there probably will be at least be a few conservative Supreme Court Justices who set out to is frightening.</p>
                        <p>1:08:19 Peter: Okay, so before we wrap up, I've gotta float this to a government official here. So I've got a proposal. Obviously, there is some concern about the constitutionality of term limits, the Constitution mandates lifetime terms, so my proposal is simple: Instead of term limits, lifespan limits on Justices, mandatory death around 75. I'm not committed to a given number, you don't have to commit to it, alright, I know you're a politician, but I just want you to think about it, something to float to your colleagues, see if there's anything for it.</p>
                        <p>1:08:53 Ro Khanna: Well, I just have to formally say I'm opposed to that, 'cause I don't want to be a clip on a late night tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>1:09:01 Peter: You're on Tucker Carlson after that, right, in that clip, I apologize. But I think that's it. We really appreciate you coming on, Congressman, and...</p>
                        <p>1:09:09 Ro Khanna: Appreciate your podcast, appreciate the depth of discussing these issues. One of the things I think your podcast is really doing is helping our side realize the stakes of the Court. For some reason, we have never realized that, and the conservatives for the past 40 years have realized that. I remember when I was in law school, how seriously people took the Federalist Society and how they were recruiting people back then in my law school class, grooming them on their ideology and their career path, and there was never anything really like that on the liberal side. So the fact that you're now making people realize that this is an equally important fight as who controls Congress or who controls the presidency, arguably the most important fight, I think is a real public service.</p>
                        <p>1:09:55 Peter: Thank you, we appreciate that.</p>
                        <p>1:09:56 Rhiannon: Thank you so much, we love that.</p>
                        <p>1:09:56 Michael: Thank you so much, that means a lot.</p>
                        <p>1:09:57 Ro Khanna: Thank you.</p>

Leon is off this week but Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are here, and they're talking about gerrymandering, the practice of drawing voting districts to favor a particular political party. The hosts are discussing Rucho versus Common Cause, a 2019 opinion that said no courts could rule on partisan gerrymandering going forward.</p>

And today, we are looking at gerrymandering, the process of dividing up congressional districts to favor a specific party. But first, we have to talk about the elephant in the room, the extremely wide-eyed elephant in the room, Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing. It's been ongoing and...</p>

                        <p>02:23 Peter: Oh, god. It's been arduous. Like, if there was any part of your mind that felt like the confirmation process is meant to be an open and honest inquiry into the competency or intellectual ability of the nominee, I hope you have shed that by now. It has been several days at this point of absolutely nothing but political theater and some of the most unbelievably hollow non-answers I've ever heard.</p>
                        <p>02:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah. Maybe even more egregious than usual. I mean, it is all political bullshit, it is all political theater. We expect the nominees to say stuff like, "I'm gonna respect the President," and not specify more about their jurisprudence, etcetera. But this one in particular, man, this past week. Her saying she can't answer hypotheticals? What?</p>
                        <p>03:13 Michael: Oh, god.</p>
                        <p>03:13 Peter: Yeah. Easily the most entertaining answer she gave, which was... She said she could not apply the law to a hypothetical set of facts, which is literally what like... All of legal practice is. So...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:25 Rhiannon: Right. It's really sad really.</p>
                        <p>03:27 Peter: Pretty disconcerting that she said she couldn't do it. She dodged every substantive question, she dodged questions about Roe v. Wade, about Obamacare and Medicare, dodged questions about whether the President could delay the election, which isn't even something you need to dodge.</p>
                        <p>03:43 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>03:44 Peter: You could just say, "No, he can't do it."</p>
                        <p>03:45 Michael: Peaceful transfer of power?</p>
                        <p>03:46 Rhiannon: Exactly. Would not say that Medicare was constitutional.</p>
                        <p>03:49 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>03:50 Rhiannon: Like, come on.</p>
                        <p>03:51 Peter: Dodged questions about whether she believes in climate change. She was like, "That's a hot button issue."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:58 Peter: Every scientist thinks it's happening, and it's human-caused, and everyone I hang out with says the opposite so who knows?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:06 Peter: The only thing that Democrats can really do in confirmation hearings is build enough political pressure that, at the least, Republicans who vote for her take a political hit of some kind, right? And they failed to do that primarily because they are led by Dianne Feinstein who is just a fucking blithering decrepit embodiment of everything wrong with the Democratic Party. Weak, out of touch, morally compromised, physically dying before our eyes, and worth like $65 million.</p>
                        <p>04:41 Rhiannon: That's right, yep.</p>
                        <p>04:42 Peter: She made no colorable effort to pin down Barrett on abortion or anything else. At the end of the hearings, she praised Lindsey Graham.</p>
                        <p>04:50 Rhiannon: Hugged him.</p>
                        <p>04:51 Peter: And gave him a hug, said it was one of the best hearings she's ever participated in.</p>
                        <p>04:56 Rhiannon: She's an embarrassment. This person is an embarrassment.</p>
                        <p>05:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:00 Peter: Oh god, retire you fucking Tales from the Crypt-looking freak.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:05 Peter: There is some good news which is that Lindsey Graham refused to take a COVID test [chuckle] and then showed up maskless, and she just fucking hugged him.</p>
                        <p>05:13 Rhiannon: Right... Right.</p>
                        <p>05:15 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:15 Peter: She's 87 years old. It's not like high risk, that's just looking the Grim Reaper in the eyes and embracing him.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:26 Michael: She's fearless man.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:32 Michael: Something I can't stop thinking about all week, I read this little book 15 years ago called "On Bullshit" by this philosopher named Harry Frankfurt, and his idea was this, like you said, "Look, somebody who tells the truth is concerned with an objective truth in the world and they're trying to reveal it to you, and a liar is also concerned with an objective truth in the world and trying to conceal it from you, whereas a bullshitter doesn't care at all." And so bullshit can be true, it can be false, it doesn't matter, it's about changing the way someone feels, changing in appearance, and in this way, it's more of an enemy of the truth than the liar. And this hearing was like having a fucking fire hose of bullshit aimed directly at your face.</p>
                        <p>06:17 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>06:17 Michael: It was so upsetting to watch considering what the stakes are, and the fact that Dianne Feinstein thought that it was the best hearing she's ever been a part of? I don't know, man, I can't handle it. I wanna punch my computer screen just thinking about it.</p>
                        <p>06:33 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's a disservice to the American people, to the public that they're acting like this...</p>
                        <p>06:37 Michael: Right. I guess for me, the question is, "What goal does this serve? This sort of disregard for the truth, and I think it serves many goals, but the biggest one is that it gives Republicans, it gives the government permission to do whatever it wants. Bullshit is what justifies all their awful excesses. It's what underlies all the worst Supreme Court decisions and her willingness to spew bullshit should be concerning for all of us on just what types of horrific Supreme Court decisions she's gonna be authoring.</p>
                        <p>07:10 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:10 Michael: And in terms of her particularly bullshitty answers, off the top of my head, her saying, she can't imagine a legislature trying to outlaw contraception."</p>
                        <p>07:23 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:24 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:24 Michael: Somebody's asking whether or not she believes that Griswold v. Connecticut, a foundational, important case about the availability of contraception to married couples and people generally, whether or not she believes it was correctly decided, and rather than answering that head-on, she tried to dodge it by saying, "Well look, I don't think that's an issue. I don't think that's something that's gonna be before the court... " and eventually she said that she doesn't think that this is something that states will be trying to do, outlaw contraception. And so it's not something she should be talking about. But for one thing, if it's not gonna be before the court then that's all the more reason why you should feel very comfortable talking about it. [chuckle] Usually, the reason to not talk about a case is well, "Well, that's pending before the court and I don't wanna pre-judge it."</p>
                        <p>08:11 Rhiannon: Right, if it's so settled, then it's not a controversy.</p>
                        <p>08:14 Michael: Right, it should be a very simple thing to talk about. But the other part is, obviously, states are constantly trying to do shit with the availability of contraception, whether it's Plan B and blurring the line between abortion and contraception, or pharmacists who reserve a religious right to deny contraception to women who have prescriptions or don't even need a prescription but want it and can't get it. These issues already exist and the idea that states won't be trying to do more and make it harder, that's a bullshit answer, top to bottom, in and out.</p>
                        <p>08:52 Peter: Yeah, the whole strategy at these things has just become, "Don't give the other side ammunition." which means, don't say anything at all. So you're in this position where everyone's asking you questions and you're just like, "What is the least information I can provide right now... And that's considered a good answer in these things?" It's just fucking worthless. We don't need these hearings.</p>
                        <p>09:12 Rhiannon: Exactly, but to me it's also like... It's more than worthless, it's concerning how little prep she had to do because it's clear that she knows she's through. So it went around Twitter that, under questioning by a Republican who was trying to give her a softball question, Senator Ben, is it Sass or Sasse?</p>
                        <p>09:33 Peter: I feel like I would know if it was Sassy.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:36 Michael: I think that's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:36 Rhiannon: Senator Sasse asked her to name the five freedoms protected by the First Amendment and okay, sure, she couldn't name all five and yeah, if you're put on the spot, you usually miss that last one, fair redress or whatever. But a Supreme Court nominee, that morning, you didn't just maybe just skim those first 10 Amendments one more time just to make sure you got that vocabulary front of mind. Do you know what I mean?</p>
                        <p>10:09 Peter: I mean, she knows that she's been on the shortlist for years. It's not just that.</p>
                        <p>10:13 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>10:14 Peter: One of the big takeaways for me was just how unprepared she was on the legal questions. I don't know if it's just because she's not particularly smart, not particularly well read on that stuff. That's how it came off. She got the applicable law in Loving v. Virginia, the interracial marriage case, wrong. She characterized it as an equal protection case rather than what it actually is, which is a equal protection and a substantive due process case. It's important because substantive due process is what underlies the Roe v. Wade right to an abortion. She got the law in the Obamacare case, that's going to be before the Supreme Court, wrong. Just very fundamental things that anyone in her position should be knocking out of the park... It's bizarre.</p>
                        <p>11:00 Rhiannon: Yeah, I know. She sounds like a fucking idiot even to law students and that's a major concern because it means that she's willing to do whatever the conservatives want her to do and want her to decide, right?</p>
                        <p>11:11 Peter: Yeah. Her handmaiden told her not to prepare.</p>
                        <p>11:13 Rhiannon: That's right. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:16 Michael: I wanna give Senator Whitehouse a little shout out for the anti-bullshit, the opposite of bullshit and bringing something real to these hearings where he had a presentation on dark money in the law and these sort of dark money organizations where we don't know, specifically, who's behind them and who's funding them, but they are very involved in supporting judicial nominees and also in funding lawsuits or filing Friend of the Court briefs. And these organizations have, I think he said there were 80 cases in the last decade where they filed Friend of the Court briefs at the Supreme Court level and they have won all 80 of those cases. And I think something like all 80 were five to four, which is a wild thing to learn... And a bracing bit of truth into, "What's actually going on here?" And who Amy Coney Barrett's actual masters are and what all this bullshit is designed to keep from view of us? And he mentions the total price tag on this whole operation is something like $250 million, which is an insane amount of money. Some of which presumably is going towards Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation... So...</p>
                        <p>12:29 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>12:30 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, I like the sort of bird's eye view of, "Why is Amy Coney Barrett doing this? Who's behind her?" But also, "Who's paying John Roberts?"</p>
                        <p>12:37 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>12:38 Peter: Or, "If you are so committed to neutral principles, why does it seem that everyone funding you comes from one end of the political spectrum?"</p>
                        <p>12:46 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>12:47 Peter: These things are sort of obvious, but they need to be highlighted in confirmation hearings.</p>
                        <p>12:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, right.</p>
                        <p>12:52 Peter: Alright, let's put a hold on this and go to a quick ad.</p>
                        <p>[pause]</p>
                        <p>12:56 Peter: Alright, let's move on. Bottomline, confirmation hearings, thumbs down, not good.</p>
                        <p>13:03 Rhiannon: Yeah, zero out of five stars.</p>
                        <p>13:05 Peter: Now, we can talk about one of the various ways in which our elections are just absolutely fucked. So today we are looking at gerrymandering. Again, the process of dividing up congressional districts to favor a specific party. And to look at gerrymandering, we need to look at Rucho v. Common Cause, the 2019 Supreme Court case that essentially made it legal. In Rucho, the court held that partisan gerrymandering, meaning gerrymandering done to benefit a political party, is a political question that is beyond the power of courts to address and as a result of the court's refusal to act, many congressional districts across the country, state and federal, remain heavily gerrymandered, functionally depriving millions of people of representation that reflects their will. Great country.</p>
                        <p>14:00 Rhiannon: Very good.</p>
                        <p>14:01 Peter: As we've discussed, the Roberts court in voting rights cases, may be the court at its most right-wing. They are truly disinterested in democracy as an inherent virtue in the law, and Rucho v. Common Cause is a great example. Here, the court had the opportunity to state something that I think is pretty obvious, both the purpose and the result of gerrymandering is the dilution of the will of voters and therefore it violates the principal function of democratic systems and is unconstitutional. On top of that, it just so happens to disproportionately benefit the political party of conservative justices. And, let's get this straight up top, both parties absolutely gerrymander.</p>
                        <p>14:47 Peter: And this case purposefully included a state that was gerrymandered by Democrats. But there is no question that Republicans do it more, do it more aggressively, and currently benefit from it more than Democrats do. Obviously, strategically drawing districts is in and of itself anti-democratic. But we're gonna talk about how it fits into this broader Republican project to suppress votes, to dilute votes, to alter the weight of votes of different people depending on who they are voting for and how that bleeds into this November and every election that they could conceivably see for the course of the next decade or two. States where congressional district boundaries benefit Republicans outnumber those that favor Democrats four to one, not to mention that Republican favoring, gerrymandering is prevalent across swing states.</p>
                        <p>15:40 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:41 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:41 Peter: This case is the court washing its hands of one of the single biggest problems in American politics. And on top of that, saying that, "No court is allowed to address the issue." This case, probably, I think in my view, reflects the most egregious abdication of the court's responsibility in modern history, and has allowed for what can only really be described as the open subversion of democracy across the country.</p>
                        <p>16:11 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>16:12 Rhiannon: Yeah, so let's get some groundwork then, just kind of set, on gerrymandering, just get a lay of this gerrymandered land that we live in. Gerrymandering, like Peter said, it's the practice of manipulating the shape of voting districts in order to give an advantage to a certain group. You intentionally create voting districts with certain demographic make-ups so that you can guarantee a particular outcome in an election. And there are different types of gerrymandering. Racial gerrymandering, for example, would be segregating voting districts by race or otherwise manipulating voting districts in order to get specific racial demographic make-up in those districts for elections... Or hypothetically, you could imagine if we wanted voters over the age of 65 to be spread out more among voting districts, we could draw a map that carved those voters into various districts even if, geographically, they all, hypothetically, resided in one neighborhood or something. In the US, some forms of gerrymandering, like racial gerrymandering, that I just mentioned, are illegal. They've been held unconstitutional, because discriminating on the basis of race in voting, disfavoring voters based on their race, that's supposed to be a no-no. So...</p>
                        <p>17:28 Peter: There's a whole amendment about that one.</p>
                        <p>17:30 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. [chuckle] But what we're talking about today is partisan gerrymandering, which is the manipulation of district boundaries in order to give an advantage to a political party.</p>
                        <p>17:42 Peter: It's only coincidentally racist.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>17:44 Rhiannon: Right, exactly, exactly. A helpful way for me to think about this concept and what's unfair about it is, partisan gerrymandering allows politicians to choose their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians. And like Peter said in this case, Rucho, the Supreme Court said that federal courts have nothing to say about partisan gerrymandering and the courts can't be involved in upholding or striking down any partisan gerrymandering because it's not a legal question but a political one. So let's talk about what partisan gerrymandering looks like in the US. When a state grows in population, it's entitled, obviously, to more representatives in Congress, so it gets additional congressional districts.</p>
                        <p>18:31 Rhiannon: And of course, states that don't have big growth or loss in population, they still will be drawing new district maps, because they need to reflect population movement within the state so that residents of the state have equal representation, no matter what city or county they live in. So the framers of the Constitution, they totally conceived of that kind of redistricting and they wanted to take into account population growth and movement and that kind of thing, but what ends up happening with the coalescence of political parties and technological advances is that now Democrats and Republicans are able to use this information to draw district maps where they've essentially hand-picked certain voters into and out of districts to get a desired party result. So let's take Texas for example, where I live, and what happened in Texas after the 2010 census data was collected. So from 2000 to 2010, the population of Texas swelled by more than four million people.</p>
                        <p>19:33 Rhiannon: Now, of those new residents, nearly 3 million were Hispanic and over half a million were African-American. So the Hispanic population of Texas had grown at a rate of 42% in that decade, and the African-American population had grown by 22%. So officially, that makes Texas now a majority-minority state. And at the same time, the population of white residents in Texas only grew by 4%. So it's important to note that without the growth in the minority population, Texas would not have received a single new congressional district, but its population did grow, so new congressional districts needed to be drawn. So you would expect that the vast majority of the population boom being people of color would mean that the new congressional districts would lean Democratic because people of color traditionally, historically vote much more for Democrats, but that's not what happened. What happened, because of partisan gerrymandering, is that the GOP map drawers basically just sliced and diced districts...</p>
                        <p>20:36 Peter: Map artists, they're called.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:42 Rhiannon: Excuse me, I'm not respecting the art, yeah. And so what happened...</p>
                        <p>20:45 Michael: That's like a sandwich artist that's...</p>
                        <p>20:47 Peter: That's right, yeah, yes.</p>
                        <p>20:47 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>20:48 Peter: It's the same guys too.</p>
                        <p>20:49 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right. So they sliced and diced these districts, and what resulted is they gave Republicans a net gain of four districts, and Democrats, zero.</p>
                        <p>21:02 Peter: Fascinating. And just to give a little bit of color, in case you're wondering exactly how this works. The idea is you pack the unfavorable party voters into the minimum amount of districts that you can, right? So if Democrats are all clustered in one city, you give them that one district, and then you draw the rest so that the largely suburban and rural areas around the city go to Republicans.</p>
                        <p>21:27 Rhiannon: Right. The way gerrymandering works is by vote dilution, which is the devaluation of one citizen's vote as compared to others. So gerrymanderers use what Peter just called packing and cracking. They pack super majorities of voters of one party into a few districts, and then they crack the rest of the voters by spreading them across many more districts and spreading them so thin that their candidates would not be able to win. So that means, in the end, that each person, whether you've been packed into a district or cracked out and spread across other districts, each person's vote is less weighty, it's less valuable than it would be in a neutrally drawn map.</p>
                        <p>22:09 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:09 Michael: Right. And it's not like a coincidence that Republicans have been gerrymandering a lot, especially in the last decade or two, in a way that's more aggressive than Democrats and all that, this was and is a concerted strategy.</p>
                        <p>22:24 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>22:25 Michael: There's a whole history. This is well detailed, it's people talking on the record about their roles in this, but there is this thing called Project REDMAP, which was something about the Republican enduring majorities or some shit like that. I don't remember what the acronym stands for, but it was birthed in 2009 when the Republican Party was still reeling from getting their asses kicked in the 2008 election. Democrats had a super majority in the Senate, they controlled a bunch of state houses, they had a large majority in the House, and Barrack Obama had one in fucking Indiana and in North Carolina, traditionally Republican states, in all corners of the map. And Republicans weren't sure where they were gonna go from there.</p>
                        <p>23:10 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>23:11 Michael: And their big plan was this, was, "Well, 2010 is when we have our decennial census, which means that's when there'll be a lot of redistricting being done. And so if we go heavy on that election, and we really focus our spending very smartly, and switch control of a few state houses, we can grab control of the legislative redistricting process and draw the maps in a way that will give us a long-term structural advantage in those states and in federal Congress as well."</p>
                        <p>23:47 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>23:47 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>23:48 Peter: I think after 2008, there was a meeting at the RNC where there was dead silence for 20 minutes and then a guy was like, "What if we cheated?" And everyone was like, "Yes. Okay, now... I didn't wanna say it."</p>
                        <p>24:00 Rhiannon: We're good now. Let's go with that.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>24:03 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, and we've talked a couple of times now on the podcast about how Republicans sort of fail to reckon with changing demographics in the US, and instead of... At about that time, 2008, 2010, instead of changing their party to be more responsive to the needs of people of color and attract people of color, especially Latinx residents in the United States, instead of doing that, right, the Republicans decided that voter suppression, gerrymandering, manipulating the vote is the strategy that they were gonna go with.</p>
                        <p>24:37 Michael: I just wanna make a point about money well spent in strategy and all that, really quick, which is like... They spent some time, they went and looked at the laws, they looked at the make-up of the state houses, and, "What would it take for us to get control of the redistricting process, state by state? Where could we conceivably get this done?"</p>
                        <p>24:57 Peter: Right. It's the state legislatures who are drawing the maps that end up being the maps for the federal Congress, which is why control of those state legislatures is so significant.</p>
                        <p>25:06 Michael: Right. And overall, it cost them, I think, $30 million, is what they put into the 2010 Project REDMAP, state legislative races. $30 million is a lot of money, especially in state races, but by comparison, I think Amy McGrath has raised more than that, running what is clearly a failed campaign, a doomed campaign, to unseat Mitch McConnell in Kentucky this year. For the cost of running her against Mitch McConnell, they got a stranglehold on the House of Representatives for eight years, and it took fucking Donald Trump and riots in the streets and shit to break that gerrymandering, right?</p>
                        <p>25:48 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>25:48 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:49 Michael: Like it was very smart, it was very sophisticated, and I'm still not sure that Democrats are on that level a decade later.</p>
                        <p>25:57 Rhiannon: No.</p>
                        <p>25:58 Peter: No.</p>
                        <p>25:58 Rhiannon: Yeah, so turning to this Supreme Court case, in Rucho v. Common Cause, there were a few different partisan gerrymandering claims that were consolidated into this one case that came before the Supreme Court, and the two states with partisan gerrymandering at issue here were North Carolina and Maryland. In North Carolina, their congressional districts had been manipulated to give Republicans an unfair advantage, and in Maryland, the districts had been manipulated to give Democrats an unfair advantage. So just breaking down, I think for illustration purposes, I think it's helpful to go through what exactly happened in these states, and I'm just gonna focus actually on North Carolina because this is so... Because this is so long. In North Carolina, after the 2010 census, Republican majorities enacted a new congressional districting plan that led to Republicans winning nine of the state's 13 seats in the House of Representatives in 2012, even though Republicans had only received 49% of the state-wide vote. So...</p>
                        <p>27:06 Michael: So not even a majority of the state-wide vote, but a super majority of the seats.</p>
                        <p>27:11 Rhiannon: Exactly. That plan they had used was actually later struck down because it was unconstitutional, racial gerrymandering, but when the rat fuckers got together to make a new plan, they called up this guy, Thomas Hofeller, to come and help out. And before Thomas Hofeller joined Scalia in hell in 2018, Hofeller was a Republican mapmaker and strategist, who was known as the redistricting guru. His specialty was in building these congressional districts, wherever he was needed, in order to ensure Republican victories in elections. And just a side note that I've been thinking about is, we've talked about how it costs money to manipulate maps on this level, at the state level, like the GOP is doing nationwide, and Hofeller being a character here just makes me think about the industry that flows from this, people make money being experts on how to manipulate maps.</p>
                        <p>28:11 Peter: Right, that mapmaker.</p>
                        <p>28:12 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>28:13 Peter: By the way, just to let the listeners know, I am working on a parody of the Fiddler on the Roof, matchmaker song, it's called Mapmaker, it'll be ready in a few weeks. And then we'll release it fully.</p>
                        <p>28:27 Rhiannon: Dork reference, bro. Dork reference.</p>
                        <p>28:30 Michael: Get his ass.</p>
                        <p>28:31 Peter: Cultural milestone.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:33 Rhiannon: So the assistance, in particular, that Hofeller would bring to Republican state parties was very technologically advanced map-making computer software, where with a single key stroke, he could manipulate just one factor and then the algorithm spits out like 20,000 possible ways to redraw the map in order to get their desired result. So with Hofeller's assistance, Republicans in North Carolina re-drew their districts so they wouldn't come under legal fire again for being racist, and as a result, they ended up getting 10 out of the 13 seats guaranteed to them.</p>
                        <p>29:14 Michael: Instead of nine.</p>
                        <p>29:15 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>29:16 Peter: Incredible.</p>
                        <p>29:16 Rhiannon: Exactly, so they bumped it up even more, and they're upfront about it too. The Republican Co-Chair of the Redistricting Committee in North Carolina said that they were, "Drawing the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats, because I do not believe it's possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats." He also later said...</p>
                        <p>29:39 Michael: Incredible.</p>
                        <p>29:39 Rhiannon: "I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country."</p>
                        <p>29:47 Peter: And if those quotes make you angry, I got good news, that guy recently resigned in shame after pleading guilty to charges related to embezzling his campaign funds.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:00 Peter: Fuck you, bro.</p>
                        <p>30:00 Michael: Yes, that's awesome.</p>
                        <p>30:01 Rhiannon: Now, Democrats do this too, and Maryland's partisan gerrymandering ensured seven out of eight House seats to Democrats in Maryland's elections from 2012 to 2018, even though Democrats never got more than 65% of the state-wide vote there. So the Democrats actions were at issue in this case too, but for our purposes, I think it's important to clarify again that this isn't quite the like, everybody does it, so that's just how the game is played like issue that the court would maybe like to frame it as.</p>
                        <p>30:33 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>30:33 Rhiannon: Republicans have gone ape shit with partisan gerrymandering in a way that Democrats haven't, and frankly, probably wish they had. In general, the thing to keep in mind, as we move into what my arch-nemesis, the little bitch, John Roberts, had to say about gerrymandering here, is that "It absolutely implicates legal constitutional questions about voting rights and how people participate in a supposed democracy, and the court just kicks the can."</p>
                        <p>31:01 Peter: Right. Right. So the underlying legal question in this case is whether purposeful gerrymandering to benefit one political party is unconstitutional, but the more immediate question that the court must address is whether the issue is what's called justiciable, meaning whether the court can hear it at all, or whether it is outside of the court's prerogative. So again, this is limited to partisan gerrymandering only, it's very clear that racial gerrymandering is justiciable because of the 15th Amendment which addresses racial discrimination in voting specifically.</p>
                        <p>31:36 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:36 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:36 Peter: So what the court holds here, in a 5-4 opinion authored by your boy, John Roberts, is that the court cannot hear this issue, and therefore complaints of partisan gerrymandering must be dismissed by courts because, according to Roberts, this is a political question that courts cannot address.</p>
                        <p>[vocalization]</p>
                        <p>31:56 Rhiannon: [Grunts]</p>
                        <p>31:58 Peter: The first thing that might jump out to you here is the idea of a "political question".</p>
                        <p>32:03 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>32:04 Peter: The court has in the past held that it cannot address what it calls purely political questions. This is the political question doctrine. The idea is that some issues are so purely within the discretion of the legislature or the presidency that they can't be addressed by a court. For example, the court won't address details about foreign relations, right, 'cause it says, "Well, that's an executive branch power." But this has always been a little weird. Not least because everything is a political question in the literal sense. The court is not hearing any issues that just don't have political implications. This doctrine has always been a way for the court to sort of just punt on issues it doesn't wanna address for whatever reason. Yeah, in some cases that might be because they don't want conflict with another branch of the government. And in the others like this one, it might be because they are right-wing pieces of shit who don't give an actual fuck about democracy.</p>
                        <p>33:02 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>33:03 Peter: Right. So let's talk about the decision itself, which is one of the most poorly reasoned of the last few years, I think. The first thing the court does is note that gerrymandering was an issue known to the Founding Fathers at the time of the drafting of the Constitution, and the point that Roberts is trying to make is like, "Well, if they knew about it back then and they didn't create a mechanism to prevent it, then I guess we can't really interfere, right?" So look, first off, obviously, our official podcast position is that the Founding Fathers were a bunch of frilly little dips who need to be given no deference.</p>
                        <p>33:37 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>33:38 Peter: But also this is a weird argument in large part because A, the Founding Fathers absolutely did not believe in actual democracy. So the fact that they didn't explicitly try to prevent gerrymandering doesn't say much. B, there weren't any real political parties at the time of the Constitution. So the idea of partisan gerrymandering to benefit a political party couldn't have been on their minds. C, the first iteration of gerrymandering as we understand it now dates to 1812, not the time when the Constitution was drafted. It was first used by the Massachusetts Governor, Elbridge Gerry, right? That's where the name comes from. And then also D... Am I at D?</p>
                        <p>34:18 Rhiannon: You're you were at D. Yep.</p>
                        <p>34:20 Peter: D.</p>
                        <p>34:20 Rhiannon: Yeap, that's number four.</p>
                        <p>34:21 Peter: The constitutional provisions most implicated here, are mainly the Equal Protection Clause, were approved almost a 100 years after the founding of the country, so it doesn't fucking matter what the Founding Fathers thought about it. So the idea that the current practice was anticipated by the Founding Fathers is both irrelevant and just revisionist bullshit.</p>
                        <p>34:41 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>34:42 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:42 Peter: And this is part of why originalism is not just theoretically stupid, but also practically useless. Even if you think that there is some wisdom in adhering strictly to these rules set out by a group of wig-wearing slave owners who didn't understand germ theory, you're still just sort of approximating their intentions in a way that is so riddled with uncertainty that it's almost completely useless. Like Roberts is saying, "Well look, they were aware of gerrymandering and they didn't do anything about it." But they were not actually really aware of gerrymandering in any meaningful sense. And even if they were, they wouldn't have enough of a lens into modern American politics for us to be able figure out what they might have thought about it. The only purpose of this sort of pseudo-originalist interpretation is to try to pretend that the court's extremely weak argument here is somehow rooted in history. It's connected to something real.</p>
                        <p>35:40 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:41 Michael: Right, and I think Roberts also uses history to engage in like sort of a rhetorical slight of hand here where he basically says in so many words that he assumes this is not justiciable unless there's historical evidence to the contrary, but I don't think that's right. Whether or not our democracy is functioning properly seems like a basically justiciable question.</p>
                        <p>36:07 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>36:08 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:08 Michael: And I would think the presumption runs the opposite way.</p>
                        <p>36:10 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>36:10 Michael: Unless there's something in Federalist 57 or whatever that says like, "Oh, drawing of districts, that's something court shouldn't be looking at," I would presume this is justiciable. Like Peter said, it's a bullshit argument, and the whole point is to just sort of throw sand in your eyes, so that you're not really like with what's going on here, which is this is an opinion running interference for the Republican Party.</p>
                        <p>36:33 Peter: Right, and that's a great point that he's saying, "Look, the Founding Fathers didn't say that we could look at this, so... " But that's not the standard. The presumption is that the court can analyze the constitution. If there's some specific reason to believe that they can't, then you work from there.</p>
                        <p>36:48 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:48 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:48 Rhiannon: Right. Exactly. And I like the framing, Michael, about what question Roberts is saying is not justiciable. This question about, in particular, partisan gerrymandering, and that's not justiciable, but there is certainly a broader question. The implications of this, is our democracy functioning?</p>
                        <p>37:06 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:06 Rhiannon: That seems really justiciable and that just reminds me of all the ways, especially conservative legal scholars will narrow a question and make it so formal and technical and specific that their answer is always a no, right?</p>
                        <p>37:22 Peter: Yeah, right.</p>
                        <p>37:23 Rhiannon: Rights shouldn't be expanded in this specific way, this specific question shouldn't be before the court, that kind of thing, but if you just broaden it just little bit, even a sixth grader can see like, "This is unfair. I feel like the Constitution should say something about this."</p>
                        <p>37:36 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:36 Michael: Right. Rhi made the point earlier that racial gerrymandering is a clearly justiciable question.</p>
                        <p>37:42 Rhiannon: Right, they have cases on it.</p>
                        <p>37:43 Michael: The functioning of our democracy and our elections, and whether or not they are they're fair is something courts regularly address. The idea that they need specific instruction from George Washington himself to answer this question is ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>37:58 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:58 Rhiannon: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>38:00 Peter: Alright, so the next portion of the opinion is like a very long digression into how Roberts thinks there's no way for the court to figure out what is or what is not fair when it comes to drawing districts. He's like, "Look, the Constitution doesn't guarantee that you have representation proportional to your party's share of the electorate, which is true in the most literal narrow sense, but of course it's a dodge of the real question which is whether it's constitutional for a party to engage in redistricting with the express purpose of disenfranchising the opposing party to their own benefit.</p>
                        <p>38:34 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>38:34 Peter: Everyone understands that representation will not exactly align with political party affiliation. That doesn't mean that someone can purposefully subvert the will of voters.</p>
                        <p>38:43 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:44 Peter: Roberts just acts like this is like this big theoretical exercise, it's so fucking obnoxious to read. The other issue with Roberts's argument is that it seems to fundamentally misunderstand the constitutional complaint. Roberts is saying, "Well, look, the Constitution doesn't guarantee that your representatives will have a particular political alignment so there's sort of no issue here." To address this more fully, I think it's important to think about a rhetorical question, "Why is it bad for someone to lose their vote?" Everyone can agree that as a general rule, adults in this country should be able to vote. That is the ostensible position of every adult in the room.</p>
                        <p>39:21 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>39:22 Michael: Not Amy Coney Barrett. Not Amy Coney Barrett.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>39:23 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:23 Peter: Yeah. That's true.</p>
                        <p>39:25 Michael: Just to be clear.</p>
                        <p>39:26 Peter: So why would it be bad for someone to just burn another person's ballot, for example?</p>
                        <p>39:32 Rhiannon: Yeah. Right.</p>
                        <p>39:33 Peter: The answer is pretty obvious, right? This is a rhetorical question. They are reportedly trying to have a government that reflects the will of the people.</p>
                        <p>39:40 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:40 Peter: There is no functional difference between a government official burning some ballots and a government official drawing congressional boundaries that are designed to render certain ballots meaningless, no functional difference. The outcome is the same. If you believe the Constitution creates any sort of obligation upon government officials to further a government that is reflective of the will of its citizens, then it... There cannot be a question that this shit is unconstitutional.</p>
                        <p>40:04 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely. And like we've said a couple of times, the Supreme Court has handled many cases that are about voting rights, that are about gerrymandering but in different contexts, that would seem to indicate that this also is unconstitutional. So for example, the 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean in part, one person, one vote. And under that jurisprudence, Justice Kagan notes in the dissent here, "The Supreme Court has ruled for instance, that districts can't be created with significantly different populations, which would dilute the weight of votes." Say for example, if you're one vote in a district of one million voters, and next door, that district is 50,000 voters, then your vote is diluted, right? And the Supreme Court has said, "That's unconstitutional." So partisan gerrymandering does this same exact thing except the dilution is based on party affiliation.</p>
                        <p>40:57 Michael: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>40:58 Peter: Yeah. And on that note, the next section is basically just Roberts saying that there's no adequate test that could be applied to gerrymandered states to see whether they are improperly gerrymandered because it's unclear what's fair and what's not fair.</p>
                        <p>41:13 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>41:13 Peter: And I don't wanna get into detail in this section, but the basic argument is just extremely disingenuous. Like Rhi just said, this is about partisan gerrymandering but everyone knows that racial gerrymandering is something that courts can address. And how do they do that? Well, they take a look at the districts, they say, "It looks, based on how these are drawn, that it was intended to disenfranchise minority voters."</p>
                        <p>41:34 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>41:34 Peter: If you analyze where the lines are going, what the implications of those districts to being drawn that way are and you say, "Okay, it looks like these are intended to disenfranchise minorities," you could do the same thing but using a partisan analysis. "It looks like these are intended to disenfranchise Democrats or Republicans or whoever." And instead of saying that, instead of saying, "Okay, look, this is difficult to analyze, but we should do our best because people are getting unjustly disenfranchised," the court is just like, "Oh, boy, we're... This is way too hard."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:01 Rhiannon: Can't do it.</p>
                        <p>42:02 Peter: This is way too hard so we're not actually gonna do it.</p>
                        <p>42:05 Rhiannon: What am I a mathematician?</p>
                        <p>42:07 Peter: Yeah. That's the United States Supreme Court taking the same approach to fixing democracy that I take toward fixing the broken door hinge on my hall closet.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:16 Peter: Just like, not today, not today.</p>
                        <p>42:19 Michael: I think one reading of this opinion is John Roberts basically saying, "Politics ain't beanbag kids, you know?"</p>
                        <p>42:27 Rhiannon: Yeah, right.</p>
                        <p>42:28 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>42:28 Michael: Like, "Oh, politics is tough and people play dirty. And what do you want us to do about it?" Except that there are limits to that, like understanding that politics is dirty, right? For sure. There's a difference between that and preventing people from voting. There's a difference between that and just straight writing people out of the body politic entirely.</p>
                        <p>42:50 Rhiannon: There has to be a line.</p>
                        <p>42:51 Michael: There has to be, right.</p>
                        <p>42:52 Peter: You can't be like, "Look, he assassinated his running mate, but politics is a dirty business."</p>
                        <p>42:57 Michael: Yes. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>42:58 Rhiannon: Don't hate the player, hate the game, baby. Like, what?</p>
                        <p>43:03 Michael: These guys... I don't think they believe there really is a line, I think they resent the fact that the 15th Amendment provides lines that they can't ignore. I think that's the best way to read Shelby County too, which we've discussed before. Like, they hate the Voting Rights Act because it's like, "Of course, we wanna suppress black votes. They don't vote for us, and that's fucking politics." Right? Like, fuck 'em.</p>
                        <p>43:23 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:24 Peter: Yeah. And we should note that the whole racial gerrymandering versus partisan gerrymandering thing... Yes, 70 years ago, there was a lot of gerrymandering that was done to disenfranchise black people because they are black.</p>
                        <p>43:37 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>43:38 Peter: Now, yes, that exists, but a big part of American racism now is not... Well, simply because they are black, we're attaching affiliations and cultural affectations to the black community, for example, that you don't like. And so partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering are incredibly closely intertwined. The idea that they are completely separate is ridiculous. And they're getting to that point where they can say, "Well, look, this isn't really racial gerrymandering because what they're really trying to do is disenfranchise Democrats." The functional result is that they are disenfranchising the same exact black communities that they were disenfranchising 70 years ago.</p>
                        <p>44:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely, and...</p>
                        <p>44:14 Peter: There's no real distinctions here, it's just that the justification that Republicans use when they're talking to the court and when they're talking to themselves is just a little bit different.</p>
                        <p>44:24 Rhiannon: Yes, exactly. And how do you think they're doing the partisan gerrymandering? When they're redrawing the congressional districts, when they're drawing these maps, they're looking at race demographics and where people of different races live in every voting district.</p>
                        <p>44:38 Michael: Absolutely. One of the reasons redistricting is so much more powerful now than it's ever been is because of the type of data they have on you.</p>
                        <p>44:45 Rhiannon: Exactly. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:46 Michael: It's more sophisticated than ever, and they... Based on your subscription habits, your race, your age, your ethnicity, your income, they can pretty much guess with specificity on how you're gonna vote.</p>
                        <p>44:58 Rhiannon: They can go block by block through a city and decide what lines to draw between which city streets.</p>
                        <p>45:05 Peter: Yeah. The last section of this opinion, it almost broke me. There's no part of this opinion where you're like, "Alright, that's a good point."</p>
                        <p>45:13 Rhiannon: Right. No, no, no.</p>
                        <p>45:14 Peter: There really isn't one.</p>
                        <p>45:15 Rhiannon: It's all fucking garbage.</p>
                        <p>45:16 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>45:17 Peter: The last section is the most outrageously disingenuous shit I've ever seen in my life. Roberts says, "Look, we're not condoning partisan gerrymandering, it's actually horrible, we hate it. We're just saying that it's an issue for the legislature." But the whole issue is that those legislatures are corrupted, right? They're compromised.</p>
                        <p>45:36 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>45:36 Peter: They're comprised of the wrong people because of gerrymandering.</p>
                        <p>45:40 Rhiannon: Yeah. They're winning because of the gerrymandering cheating thing, right?</p>
                        <p>45:44 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>45:45 Peter: The problem is that districts are drawn such that the legislatures themselves are unfair. They can't fix the problem of their own corruption, the court has to. The court has to. Roberts is literally saying, "It's terrible that our legislatures are corrupt, undemocratic institutions. Hopefully, the legislature will do something about this."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>46:04 Rhiannon: Right. Why have checks and balances, you stupid bitch?</p>
                        <p>46:09 Peter: This is a district attorney getting up in front of the press and being like, "Well, the mafia's doing all sorts of crime. Hopefully, that will be sorted out by the mafia."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>46:17 Peter: "That's really... It's a mafia business." Just absolute baby brain shit, just like a statement so disingenuous that it almost feels like they put this section in just to mock you. Are you fucking with us? That's what it feels like.</p>
                        <p>46:31 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>46:32 Michael: You're saying these elections are broken and we hear you, and our answer is, "Those broken elections are the solution to problem."</p>
                        <p>46:40 Rhiannon: Right. Get out and vote, baby.</p>
                        <p>46:43 Michael: What am I supposed to do with that? It's insulting. It is.</p>
                        <p>46:47 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>46:47 Rhiannon: Absolutely. So I think we should spend a little bit of time on the dissent.</p>
                        <p>46:52 Michael: It's good.</p>
                        <p>46:52 Rhiannon: It's written by Justice Kagan, and I'm not ever all that impressed with Elena or her writing, but I have to say she goes in here. And y'all know I'm a quote girl.</p>
                        <p>47:02 Peter: Is that how you would describe yourself? As a quote girl?</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>47:05 Rhiannon: On this pod.</p>
                        <p>47:07 Peter: When you said it, I wasn't like... "Yeah. That's right, Rhiannon's a quote girl. We all know that."</p>
                        <p>47:12 Rhiannon: I'm a lot of things, okay?</p>
                        <p>47:14 Michael: She likes to read from the opinions. I get that.</p>
                        <p>47:16 Rhiannon: Thank you.</p>
                        <p>47:16 Peter: Okay, okay.</p>
                        <p>47:17 Rhiannon: I read and engage with the text.</p>
                        <p>47:18 Peter: Alright, you're a quote girl.</p>
                        <p>47:21 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>47:21 Rhiannon: Okay. [chuckle] So I just wanna read a few things that Justice Kagan says that I think really plainly identify what is so deeply concerning about this majority opinion, and I think this dissent is the closest you can get to reading something like, "What the fuck is your fucking problem, you dumbasses?" in a Supreme Court opinion.</p>
                        <p>47:40 Peter: Yeah, 'til they put me on the court, baby.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>47:45 S?: The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights, the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives. In doing so, these gerrymanders dishonored our democracy, turning upside down the core American idea that all governmental power derives from the people."</p>
                        <p>48:13 Rhiannon: She goes on later and says, "Liberty demands not only that all power should be derived from the people, but that those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people. Members of the House of Representatives, in particular, are supposed to recollect that dependence every day. To retain an intimate sympathy with the people, they must be compelled to anticipate the moment when their exercise of power is to be reviewed. Election day, next year, and two years later, and two years after that, is what links the people to their representatives and gives the people their sovereign power. That day is the foundation of democratic governance, and partisan gerrymandering can make it meaningless."</p>
                        <p>48:53 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>48:53 Rhiannon: So she doesn't just talk about the erosion of democracy in these broad terms, she gets really specific about how individuals' constitutional rights are violated in this kind of system. You know, she points out that a districting system that is so gerrymandered on this level is flat out not giving people an equal vote, and it's not fair and free participation in people's system of government. She says this is a violation of the 14th Amendment, this is a violation of the First Amendment, and the incredulousness, I think, at what the majority is doing in saying that this isn't a justiciable issue, is really palpable in her dissent.</p>
                        <p>49:29 Michael: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>49:30 Peter: Yeah, I think she hits all the points. One thing that she would never, and no Supreme Court justice would ever have the balls to say is that, every step that the conservatives on the court take towards conceding the illegitimacy of elections is a step towards conceding the illegitimacy of the seats that they sit in.</p>
                        <p>49:46 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>49:47 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>49:47 Peter: If you believe that the modern American election system is, to some degree, illegitimate, that Republicans have been able to artificially suppress the votes of Democrats in order to gain power, then you have to concede that, for example, Donald Trump's Supreme Court appointments flow from that.</p>
                        <p>50:08 Rhiannon: Yes. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>50:09 Peter: And Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, and, soon, Amy Coney Barrett are sitting in what are essentially illegitimate seats.</p>
                        <p>50:15 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>50:16 Peter: Republicans like John Roberts aren't just saying, "This is just how politics goes because it's their party." It's also them. This institution rules over us predicated upon the same exact illegitimacy that someone like Donald Trump does.</p>
                        <p>50:32 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>50:32 Michael: Yep. That's right.</p>
                        <p>50:34 Peter: So one important thing to realize is that the court is holding, in this case, that this is non-justiciable, meaning that it cannot constitutionally be addressed by courts. That means that all challenges to partisan gerrymandering in federal courts are non-justiciable, and courts across the country are forbidden from hearing them. So it's not just that the court is punting on this, it's taking it out of the realm of the judiciary entirely, taking one of the most prevalent anti-democratic practices in this country and basically saying, "There's nothing to be done about this legally."</p>
                        <p>51:07 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>51:07 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>51:08 Peter: So the immediate implications of this are kind of obvious, gerrymandered states remain gerrymandered, which means their elections are just less democratic. But there's also indirect consequences. The biggest is, as we've discussed in the past, states set their own election laws for federal elections. So if Republicans gerrymander the state legislature, districts in North Carolina, which they do, then not only do they artificially maintain control of that legislature, they can use that control to engage in voter suppression at the federal level. So this stuff kind of piles up, and it's worth pointing out, not just to show how these sort of anti-democratic processes are intertwined, but also how stopping one can have this aggregating cumulative effect.</p>
                        <p>51:51 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>51:51 Peter: If the Supreme Court strikes down gerrymandering, you get rid of this bullshit practice, but you also get rid of all these downstream effects that start unraveling the GOP's voter suppression project.</p>
                        <p>52:02 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>52:03 Peter: It cannot be stressed enough how many parallels there are between the current Republican Party's voter suppression strategy and the bus and speed. They need voter suppression to secure their election wins, they need those election wins to secure their control of the courts, and they need control of the courts to secure voter suppression. If any link in this daisy chain drops below 50 miles per hour, the whole thing blows up. This metaphor makes sense for the record. It's a good metaphor.</p>
                        <p>52:34 Rhiannon: Well, you know, while you were talking, Peter, I was thinking of the stupid onion. What did you describe as a stupid layered onion the other day?</p>
                        <p>52:41 Peter: The Electoral College is a stupid layered onion.</p>
                        <p>52:43 Rhiannon: Yeah, the Electoral College is a stupid layered onion. The conservative project of disenfranchising voters is a stupid, rotten, smelly-ass, ugly onion.</p>
                        <p>52:55 Peter: Yeah. And it's a bus. You guys are keeping track of this, right?</p>
                        <p>53:00 Rhiannon: It's an onion, it's a bus, it's a ball that's hit out of the park.</p>
                        <p>53:03 Michael: John Roberts is gonna hit that stinkin' onion 500 feet into the stands, baby. Home run.</p>
                        <p>53:09 Peter: Yeah. And if that ball ever goes below 50 miles per hour...</p>
                        <p>53:13 Michael: It's gonna explode. It's gonna explode.</p>
                        <p>53:16 Peter: Touch down, baby.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>53:21 Michael: So if all these mixed metaphors are confusing you...</p>
                        <p>53:25 Peter: Which they shouldn't be, for the record.</p>
                        <p>53:26 Rhiannon: No way. How could that be...</p>
                        <p>53:27 Michael: I think they're very clear. Let's just think of this upcoming election, which, again, as we've mentioned many times in the past, has a lot of room for wrongdoing and malfeasance by state legislators that, as we've been saying here, are often heavily gerrymandered. If you remember in our Electoral College episode last week, we talked about how state legislatures can pick the electors who go to the Electoral College. And that means heavily gerrymandered legislatures, like the one in Wisconsin for example, could just ignore the voters in their states, and that wouldn't be that crazy. Democrats have outvoted Republicans in Wisconsin state legislature races several times in the last decade and yet the Republicans have super majorities in the state houses.</p>
                        <p>54:19 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>54:21 Michael: And we mentioned that the election could be decided in the House of Representatives, which again, if you remember, has this ridiculous method where each state delegation gets one vote. And again, the make-up of those state delegations will be gerrymandered in a lot of cases. North Carolina is a purple state, it's regularly like a 51%, 49% vote, Democrats or Republicans nudging each other out. But Republicans control that state delegation with a commanding majority because it's heavily gerrymandered.</p>
                        <p>54:51 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>54:52 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>54:52 Michael: And look, we've said this many times, but this is a political party that has sort of abandoned assembling a majority coalition. They're not interested in having a popular mandate at all. So yeah, what you have is gerrymandered state legislatures who might ratfuck the election, and why not? That's just what they've been doing for a while now.</p>
                        <p>55:14 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>55:21 Peter: Next week, we are doing an episode on court reform, and we will be talking to... This can't be right. Congressman Ro Khanna.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>55:34 Rhiannon: Why is this happening?</p>
                        <p>55:35 Michael: No, we deserve this. I'm just surprised it took this long.</p>
                        <p>55:39 Peter: Someone at Ro... In Ro Khanna's communications office has made a horrific mistake, and...</p>
                        <p>55:45 Michael: Career misstep.</p>
                        <p>55:46 Peter: And we will be punishing him for it.</p>
                        <p>55:50 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>55:50 Peter: That's a real thing, by the way. That's really...</p>
                        <p>55:52 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, we're not joking. Ro Khanna is going to be on 5-4.</p>
                        <p>55:56 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>55:57 Michael: We're talking court reform, it's gonna be great.</p>
                        <p>56:00 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>56:00 Peter: Follow us on Twitter, @fivefourpod. I don't think we have an Instagram yet but...</p>
                        <p>56:05 Rhiannon: We do but we don't post nothing on it.</p>

                        <p>00:02 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael discuss the Electoral College and its potential to wreak absolute havoc on elections, both this November and in the future.</p>
                        <p>00:16 [Archival]: Most people are aware that the present system is dangerous. It's outdated and it's archaic. It's one that needs to be revised and made responsive to the needs of today's electoral problems.</p>
                        <p>00:26 [Archival]: We can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.</p>
                        <p>00:36 Leon: This is 5-4, the podcast about how much the Supreme Court and the Electoral College suck.</p>
                        <p>00:47 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have weakened America's immune system like a lifetime of poor nutrition. I am Peter, I'm here with Michael...</p>
                        <p>01:04 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:04 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:04 Rhiannon: Hiiii... Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:07 Peter: And this is a special episode, the first in a month-long pre-election series of episodes that dig into the rotten core of our ostensibly democratic institutions.</p>
                        <p>01:20 Rhiannon: Let's do it.</p>
                        <p>01:22 Peter: And today, we are looking at maybe the dumbest, most anti-democratic of our institutions, the Electoral College.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Peter: Before we jump in, we should talk about the fact that Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings are ongoing as of Monday of this week. I think for now, our basic position is, A, she's probably going to get through and B, confirmation hearings are just sort of political theater and aren't really substantively very interesting. She might say something interesting and if she does, we'll be sure to talk about it, but that's sort of just how I feel about it.</p>
                        <p>02:02 Rhiannon: Yeah. I think it's not interesting, and I am just thinking about what a weak party the Democrats are right now. If you think about how immediately after Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, people were like, oh, if they try to ram somebody through, we're going to burn it all down, right, and now it's just like, okay, well, it's happening. What are we doing? Nothing.</p>
                        <p>02:21 Michael: Feinstein's just carrying on like normal.</p>
                        <p>02:25 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>02:26 Peter: The real big news is that no one is wearing masks except for Coney Barrett, and half of these people actively right now have COVID. It's not like it's risky or whatever, like they have it. They have it.</p>
                        <p>02:39 Rhiannon: This is true.</p>
                        <p>02:41 Peter: So this is Dianne's last confirmation hearing.</p>
                        <p>02:49 Rhiannon: Which if you're some people is good news.</p>
                        <p>02:54 Peter: Yeah, yeah, I think it is. It's a small silver lining.</p>
                        <p>03:00 Michael: I also, I just want to say I don't have an appetite for bullshit anymore, that's all it is.</p>
                        <p>03:05 Rhiannon: And that's what it is, exactly.</p>
                        <p>03:06 Michael: Nobody believes a word of what they're saying and they don't care, and it's all about jockeying for political advantage and just like, I don't know, fuck that. I don't need to get myself all angry about that on a Sunday night or whenever we're going to record this.</p>
                        <p>03:21 Peter: Yeah, so we'll talk a little bit more about Amy as things unfold. But for now, we will turn away from the political theater of the confirmation hearing, and we will turn towards the system that A, decides who wins the presidency and B, is ripe for abuse by Republicans in this upcoming election.</p>
                        <p>03:40 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>03:42 Peter: The Electoral College. The Electoral College is a system so fucking stupid that it cannot withstand the first question that comes to everyone's mind when they hear about it: Why not just be a regular democracy?</p>
                        <p>03:54 Rhiannon: Get her ass, get that Electoral College.</p>
                        <p>03:56 Peter: No amount of historical context or analysis or abstruse arguments about the utility of the Electoral College will ever defeat that question.</p>
                        <p>04:06 Michael: Yeah, that's it.</p>
                        <p>04:06 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:06 Peter: So we're going to dig a little bit into why we have the Electoral College, why it persists, what the legal rules surrounding it are and, most importantly, whether and how it might be used to stage a nice little American coup next month. We've talked a lot in recent episodes about voter suppression, which is and remains the GOP's primary electoral strategy these days, but there is a lingering question here of what their options are if that fails, right, what sort of anti-democratic shenanigans can they engage in? What can they do if they want to steal this election after the fact?</p>
                        <p>04:45 Peter: And to understand that, you have to understand the Electoral College. So first of all, we're going to assume that you have some understanding of what the Electoral College is, but it's a system for presidential elections where each state gets a number of electors based roughly on its population and a candidate who wins the state under the current rules wins all of that state's electors. So the reason why this exists is a little more complex, and we're not historians, so we're not going to go into too much detail here, but we want to give you a little bit of color. So like we've mentioned before, all the Constitution really says about voting in presidential elections is that states appoint their electors as they deem fit, and those electors cast their votes for President.</p>
                        <p>05:31 Peter: The original idea behind this was that people would vote for an elector in their district who would in turn vote in a way that reflects the will of those people to some degree, but also does not result in too much upheaval, 'cause of course, the electors would be fancy boys from high society who have a vested interest in sociopolitical stability.</p>
                        <p>05:52 Rhiannon: Right. And the fact that the outcome was meant to be controlled by elites, that really goes deep here. The system as it was originally designed would rarely produce a majority winner, which in turn results in the House of Representatives holding a vote on who wins. This all changed as political parties coalesced and in the mid-1800s we got to a point where most states were holding state-wide votes, where the winner takes all of the electors, and that's the system that reigns supreme today.</p>
                        <p>06:21 Michael: Right. And in the modern day, electors themselves are selected through processes that vary state by state, but largely speaking are people who are nominated by the state parties, Democratic and Republican parties, and they all get together to officially vote in mid to late December.</p>
                        <p>06:40 Peter: Right. So I don't want to turn this episode into pure bitching about the Electoral College, but I think it's important to understand the Electoral College, not as like some sort of stroke of genius by our Founding Fathers, because that's how everyone tries to color it when you're growing up. It's deeply connected to the fact that our country as founded was really not a democracy in any meaningful sense, and was a nation controlled quite directly by sociopolitical elites, and the Electoral College and all of the sort of inherently undemocratic components of American government are vestiges of these anti-democratic oligarchic roots. They're not like clever protections against the excesses of democracy or whatever, like nerdy apologists for the Founding Fathers want you to believe.</p>
                        <p>07:26 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:27 Peter: They were designed to ensure that the average person, the average citizen, did not exercise too much control over government, so that power could remain in the hands of the most syphilis-ridden group of dandies in modern history.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:41 Rhiannon: That's right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>07:44 Peter: And every defense of this system is incoherent. A popular vote would be the only system where everyone's vote matters equally. Everything else is just hand-waving bullshit. To me, that's sort of the bottom line.</p>
                        <p>07:58 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:00 Michael: No, that's absolutely right. Another thing about the Electoral College, though, is that it's super racist, as if being really stupid and really elitist isn't enough. So just as a practical matter, the number of electoral votes each state gets is the sum of its total number of representatives in the House and the Senate. So small states that only have one member of the House of Representatives, they get three electoral votes, one for their House member and two for their two Senators. So if you go back to the Founding and you remember your social studies from when you were a kid, at the Founding, the small states were concerned about getting overrun by the big states, and that's why we have the Senate where each state has equal representation.</p>
                        <p>08:40 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>08:40 Michael: And you might also remember that the slave states were worried about being overrun by the free states, and so what we had was the Three-Fifths Compromise, where slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of determining the population of the state, which gave slave states bigger representation in the House. Those compromises are reflected in the Electoral College, since it is the sum of your House and Senate members. It's just historical fact that the Three-Fifths Compromise gave slave states a bigger representation in the Electoral College than they otherwise would have.</p>
                        <p>09:20 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>09:21 Michael: And then this gets worse after the Civil War, because the Three-Fifths Compromise disappears, and now freed slaves are full people, and all of a sudden the Confederate states have their populations increasing in their Congressional representation, increasing and by extension the number of electoral votes they get in Electoral College increasing, but thanks to Jim Crow, thanks to literacy tests, thanks to election day violence and just general campaigns of violence, blacks were effectively disenfranchised. And so what you had was Confederate states increasing in power in this way while still benefiting off the backs of disenfranchised minorities. So this is up through the '70s that this was an inherently white supremacist institution, and in the '70s, there was a movement to abolish it and surprise surprise, it was Southern states that were against that, and today you still see all this same shit. There's a direct through line here.</p>
                        <p>10:21 Peter: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:24 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:26 Peter: So where does this god-awful system leave us? There are some very obvious ways in which the Electoral College is undemocratic. It results in certain states being politically irrelevant in presidential politics. It essentially erases the will of minority voters in every state, and when I say minority voters, I mean whoever is not voting with the winning candidate in that state. So Wyoming has just over half a million people and has three electoral votes, California has 40 million people and has 55 electoral votes, so people in Wyoming just have vastly more influence per vote over the outcome of a presidential election.</p>
                        <p>11:06 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>11:07 Peter: It also makes certain undemocratic practices and tactics like voter suppression much simpler. If the election were decided by a nationwide popular vote, voter suppression on a scale necessary to change the outcome of an election would be almost impossible. The Electoral College makes it so that it can be incredibly effective. In swing states where voting margins can be in the tens of thousands, disenfranchising fairly small portions of the population can swing the entire state in one direction or the other. You couldn't have that if you didn't have the Electoral College. It should go without saying that this is pretty useful for a party whose entire electoral strategy is to ensure that the will of the majority of the people in the country is suppressed.</p>
                        <p>11:48 Peter: So even when it's being used "correctly," the Electoral College is only nominally democratic and is easily abused by bad faith actors. But the Trump administration's fairly open strategy of ensuring that they win this election, even if they lose, might have you asking some questions about what exactly they could do to take advantage of this system and stage something that looks less like electoral tactics and more like an outright coup. And the first thing we should talk about is maybe the simplest issue: Can't the electors who make up the Electoral College just cast their vote for whoever they want, even if they're supposed to cast it for whoever wins the state?</p>
                        <p>12:33 Peter: The Constitution doesn't say that electors have to vote for anyone in particular. It's state laws that say that they have to vote for someone in particular. So electors who cast their vote for someone other than the candidate who wins the state are called faithless electors, and this has been an issue in the past, because although most states have laws saying that electors have to cast their vote for the winner of the state, there's long been a strain of thought that this is unconstitutional. Many people believe that the Founders' intent was for electors to be able to exercise their own will in their vote, meaning that states actually can't require them to vote for whoever wins the state. The electors are sort of there as a bulwark against democracy gone wrong.</p>
                        <p>13:17 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>13:17 Peter: They're meant to protect us from the hordes of people who are trying to elect someone that the elites don't like.</p>
                        <p>13:23 Rhiannon: Exactly, and that actually became a bit of an issue in the last election. Despite there being no more than one faithless elector in any election since 1912, there were 10 in 2016.</p>
                        <p>13:35 Peter: Yeah, and we should note that was mostly due to an effort by Democrats. If you recall, they became obsessed with the idea of what they called Hamilton Electors, and this was... They were banking on a theory I just described that electors have this obligation to protect us from the Donald Trump presidency, and so they should vote their will, and they were trying to get electors to cast their votes for centrist Republicans. They were saying, Republican electors, stand up to Donald Trump and cast your vote for fucking John Kasich, whatever. And they had very moderate success with this, but certainly it was the first time in over 100 years that this sort of faithless elector thing had gone anywhere. There hadn't been since, I think it was maybe 1912, an election where there was more than a one faithless elector. And then this one again, there were 10.</p>
                        <p>14:31 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. So the Supreme Court ended up taking up this issue just this year in a case called Chiafalo versus Washington, and in that case, the Court unanimously held that states can essentially force electors to vote for whoever wins the popular vote in the state. So that sounds great. But if you look a little closer, it's not really clear how much this ruling actually matters, so only 33 states have these laws, and of those only 14 actually cancel the faithless elector's vote, which means that in 36 states, a faithless elector vote will still count.</p>
                        <p>15:09 Peter: And also, it means that these states are passing laws that say, no, you have to vote for whoever wins the state, but there's no penalty in many of these states if you violate the law, and in many of these states, the vote still counts, so... Is that even a law?</p>
                        <p>15:26 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>15:27 Michael: A sternly worded warning. You'd better, you'd better.</p>
                        <p>15:33 Peter: Please do it.</p>
                        <p>15:36 Rhiannon: Exactly, so the next question, of course, is like, how much does this matter? The good news is the party of the candidate who wins the state chooses the electors, so the GOP may well be openly questioning election results in certain states, but they are not likely to convince Democratic electors to switch teams. So the concern with faithless electors is more kind of theoretical than real, in order to steal the election, what Republicans really need is a way to prevent Democratic electors from being appointed in the first place, and that brings us to the GOP's next option.</p>
                        <p>16:10 Peter: Yeah, yeah, and this is, I think, the meat of it, this is like where the coup might happen, I think. Again, the Constitution says that state legislatures shall direct "the manner in which electors are appointed," so that there's a possibility that Republican-controlled legislatures in states that Biden wins, where it seems like Biden has won, could say, okay, we don't trust the results in our state, so we're going to appoint our own electors, and they just appoint electors, Republican electors, who will vote for Trump.</p>
                        <p>16:44 Peter: And I think that's the threat that a lot of people are really concerned with this election. The problem with this strategy is that states already have laws on the books concerning how they appoint their electors, so it's unclear if they could actually change those laws after an election has already happened. And you also have the fact that Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin have Democratic Governors who may be able to veto these types of shenanigans if that's an option presented to them.</p>
                        <p>17:11 Michael: And there's also the possibility, I'll talk about this in detail later, that Democrats, if they control the House and the Senate, could essentially reject those electors.</p>
                        <p>17:20 Peter: Yeah, but again, the Constitution says very little about this, so there's a lot of room for interpretation that could be leveraged by Republicans if they needed it. Electors don't vote until well into December, so there's a real argument that the states have the option of changing how electors are appointed before then. The reason scholars have been saying, I think a lot of election law scholars have been saying it's unlikely, is that the state laws for each state provide that electors will go to the winner in that state. To change the rules after voting begins seems like it's sort of breaking what is essentially a compact with voters about how their votes are going to be tallied. But there are a couple of important things to remember here.</p>
                        <p>18:00 Peter: One is that it's not clear what the Supreme Court would think about this argument. In Bush v. Gore, the conservative majority reasserted for the first time in decades that state legislatures could change the rules and appoint whatever electors they want, but the Court didn't go so far as to explain whether they could do it after the election began, for example. The other thing to remember, and maybe the more important thing, is that this isn't really about constitutional interpretation. The Constitution says almost nothing about this. This is about power. Republican state legislators aren't reading the Constitution looking for the correct answer; the token state legislators aren't reading anything at all.</p>
                        <p>18:42 Michael: The take-out menu at Denny's.</p>
                        <p>18:46 Rhiannon: Easy lay up, but I'm glad you took it.</p>
                        <p>18:50 Peter: They just need some leeway to work with here, right. Like, to essentially treat the vote in your state as invalid and appoint your own electors after an election already happened is clearly a bit insane, but if it's the only thing standing between Republicans and power, sorry to the election law scholars, but fucking bank on it, dude, bank on it. This is state Republican politicians we're talking about, the lowest form of human life. Even Congressional Republicans wouldn't stop to these levels. They're barely sentient little parasites. The only question in my mind is whether the Court is willing to essentially toss out the remaining crumbs of our democracy entirely and substitute with what's basically rule by fiat. I think that is the real fundamental question.</p>
                        <p>19:42 Michael: Right. So there is another possibility, which is that this gets decided by the federal government and specifically the House of Representatives, and this happens in the case of a tie or no candidate gains the majority. Don't worry, if you're concerned, if it just sounds really uncertain, because our Founding Fathers have instituted the absolute dumbest fucking system imaginable to remedy the situation.</p>
                        <p>20:10 Rhiannon: James Madison's on the case, don't worry.</p>
                        <p>20:15 Michael: So if nobody has the majority, the House of Representatives will meet, and we should note, this is the newly elected House of Representatives, not the current one. And each state, not each Representative, but each state will get a single vote for President, and it's winner take all, baby.</p>
                        <p>20:35 Peter: That's the talley, yeah. That's what I'm talking about. This is so incredible, because how do you even come up with a system that ineffective. I mean, it's just fucking bizarre.</p>
                        <p>20:47 Michael: It is, it is.</p>
                        <p>20:49 Peter: California, who are you voting for? Okay, that's one vote. And what about you, Rhode Island? Yeah, that's also one vote.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Michael: There's like 50 legislators in California and there's one in Montana. And the guy Montana gets the same...</p>
                        <p>21:01 Peter: You don't even have to say Montana, it's just like, Steve, who you voting for?</p>
                        <p>21:05 Rhiannon: And another... This is kind of a remote possibility, but an interesting side note is that the Senate actually chooses the Vice President and there every Senator gets a vote.</p>
                        <p>21:17 Peter: Yeah, fuck it, why not just use a totally different system in the Senate.</p>
                        <p>21:22 Rhiannon: So it's actually not hard to imagine a scenario where you end up with an opposite party President and Vice President.</p>
                        <p>21:29 Peter: I smell a sitcom.</p>
                        <p>21:34 Michael: Well, I was going to say political assassinations would be way in vogue.</p>
                        <p>21:38 Peter: Just Biden and Trump just brawling like little siblings in the Oval Office.</p>
                        <p>21:42 Rhiannon: I was going to say, I'm just adding that to the long, long list of items that give me anxiety. It's a list that I read before bed every night.</p>
                        <p>21:53 Peter: Yes, like Arya's kill list in Game of Thrones, Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>21:58 Michael: The Senate appoints Vice President Pence. So back to the practical realities of this. In the House, as it's currently constituted, the Republican Party, despite being a minority in the House, controls 26 state delegations, the Democrats control 22. Pennsylvania is tied, and Michigan is sort of tied. There are seven Democrats, six Republicans, and Justin Amash. Amash, Amash, who fucking...</p>
                        <p>22:29 Rhiannon: I don't know, and not to be my Palestinian dad real quick, but Amash sounds Arab, gotta say.</p>
                        <p>22:37 Michael: Fuck it. He's retiring, he's going to be replaced by a Republican anyway, so whatever. So look, Republicans right now, it's easy to see how they could retain control of 26 delegations. It's not outside the realm of possibility that Dems could flip that, although it seems unlikely, but like we said, Montana only has one representative, and that's like a lean Republican, Alaska only has when representive, and that's also lean Republican, but those are competitive races.</p>
                        <p>23:04 Peter: It's hard to do voter suppression in Alaska because there are no minorities. It doesn't work out there.</p>
                        <p>23:10 Rhiannon: Well, indigenous people.</p>
                        <p>23:13 Peter: Alright, cut that. Gotcha.</p>
                        <p>23:21 Michael: Florida and Kansas also have very narrow margins in their congressional delegations, so those could change hands. You might be thinking, reasonably, if there's a big enough Dem wave to flip these delegations and give Democrats control of 26 delegations, then wouldn't Joe Biden have enough electoral votes to just not make this an issue. But you know, again, it's a real possibility. The Pennsylvania State Republican Party, they have legislators there who've already floated this to the press, that they are considering trying to appoint their own electors. They have a Democratic Governor, it would be its own sort of constitutional mess, if they try to do that.</p>
                        <p>24:00 Michael: But it's like Peter described a minute ago, if Republicans try to steal the electoral votes of states Biden won, what Democrats can do is they can try to get those electoral votes thrown out. So if that happens, the Democrats aren't without options. So one thing they could do is contest the electoral votes that the GOP tried to steal and then have them thrown out. So this shit, we're getting very obscure here, I was like toiling through the US code reading really, really poorly written laws for this, so...</p>
                        <p>24:32 Rhiannon: Michael was in his zen place.</p>
                        <p>24:36 Michael: Apologies if there are any election experts who think that I'm getting something wrong here, but...</p>
                        <p>24:42 Peter: Who cares?</p>
                        <p>24:43 Michael: This is my own reading of the law, so the way this works is if the body that accepts and counts the Electoral College votes is Congress, both Houses get together, and you need a written objection and one Senator and one House member needs to sponsor the objection. And if you do, if you object to Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes, the Houses separate and they each meet and, as far as I can tell, after a period of debate, they vote by a majority vote. And so if you control both Houses, even if you only have 22 state delegations, if you have a majority of votes in the House and you have a majority of votes in the Senate, you can just say, no, fuck Pennsylvania. This isn't on the up and up. And in this process, you could essentially deny both candidates a majority of electoral votes and bring it to the House. That's my understanding of this.</p>
                        <p>25:33 Michael: Now, that might seem like a self-defeating thing if Democrats don't control 26 state delegations in the House, but there are things they could do with that too. One thing that they can do is they can just try to prevent certain Republicans from being seated long enough, which... The way this works is like... So let's say you want to flip the Florida delegation and it only takes two seats. You can have two people who lost to Republicans challenge that loss and they register their challenge with the House, and then the House will have to take up an investigation, and this can take time. It can take 30 days after the election certification, so you can be putting in your challenge in mid-December, just a few weeks before this all happens. And the House can, they can pre-textually investigate this and drag their feet and in the process they can say, well, we're not seating you while this investigation's on-going.</p>
                        <p>26:26 Rhiannon: We won't seat the Republican who supposedly won.</p>
                        <p>26:30 Michael: Right, who definitely won, but we're not going to recognize you. Republicans have done this before.</p>
                        <p>26:35 Rhiannon: Of course they have.</p>
                        <p>26:35 Michael: They did with Al Franken in the Senate, and in the process denied Democrats the ability to have like a 60 vote filibuster-breaking majority for several months. It's another form of hard ball. So you could drag these out for months, and in that time, it might be a temporary period, but for a temporary period, you could control 26 state delegations long enough to install the President. The big concern is, that it's a level of coordination and hard ball that I'm not sure the Democrats are capable of, and even if they are, if we got to this, I have no doubt that there would be violence in the streets, like the fucking Proud Boys and the... What are they? Gigalos? Jugalos?</p>
                        <p>27:24 Rhiannon: Whatever, those fucking clowns.</p>
                        <p>27:25 Michael: Those fuckers in the Hawaiian shirts with the guns, and cops, I'm sure.</p>
                        <p>27:31 Peter: I don't know, though, I don't know that conservatives know how to do violence in the streets in any real way, because they don't have targets, what they would do is use coordinated campaigns of violence against specific people. They don't like get out there and riot or anything.</p>
                        <p>27:46 Michael: Right, right, right, right. But there will be death threats against Congressmen, for sure. And there would be like, like when they shut down the state house in, where was it, Michigan. But, yeah, you'd see militia types protesting peacefully, but with enough guns that it would be extremely intimidating. It would be ugly, and it's why we want to avoid this sort of thing, like we want a clean victory.</p>
                        <p>28:11 Peter: I think it's time. I think it's time for an ad.</p>
                        <p>28:12 Peter: So enough about every avenue that we could possibly go down in the Electoral College shit show, although it is fun, the one thing I learned just doing a really casual afternoon research for this episode was that, as dumb as the Electoral College is just on its face, it only gets dumber, every layer you peel, like a stupid onion. You peel one layer back and underneath is something even dumber and you're like, holy shit, this goes all the way into the core. It's sort of crazy. Very impressive that these people, the Founding Fathers, have managed for 250 years to successfully engage in a propaganda campaign that they are smart. Like look at these incredible systems that balance each other out, and you're like, oh, what are the systems? And they're like, oh, if we don't know who the president is, that each state gets a vote, and then for the vice president, you do the same thing, and then you have... And then that's how it works. And you're like, wow. Wow. Alexander Hamilton. Incredible. You deserve all those cashews, all across the country.</p>
                        <p>29:36 Rhiannon: Yeah, you know what this episode has me thinking so much about is we talk a lot about demystifying the Court as an institution, it's not this objective, perfect scientific thing that you put in the variables and it spits out the correct result, and we should all be deferring to it and super respectful of it. Researching for this episode has reminded me, I think, about how much we need to demystify the work of the Founding Fathers, and how that propaganda campaign is absolutely weaponized by Republicans, right. The Founding Fathers are not perfect, they were a bunch of big dumb idiots, rich at the time, slave owners, all of the most terrible things, and... Look, they were making it up.</p>
                        <p>30:23 Peter: Yeah. The funniest thing about the American founding is that it's pretty widely accepted that none of them really anticipated the rise of political parties, which happened like 10 years later...</p>
                        <p>30:34 Michael: Immediately.</p>
                        <p>30:37 Peter: And then just became the primary concern in American politics for 220 years, right? And they were like, oh, shit, yeah. And then once that happens, all of the institutions steadily crumble and the sort of political calamity that you see now is in large part due to the fact that these systems are not built to account for two ideologically opposed parties who have really no interest in mutual cooperation.</p>
                        <p>31:11 Michael: Something I also... Like when we're talking about that's something that I've been thinking about a lot lately is like, we talk a lot about how fucking stupid Antonin Scalia is and what a dope Sam Alito is, and everybody knows what a dumb asshole like Donald Trump is or Mike Pence, or whoever, right? And there are idiots on the Democratic side of the aisle as well, and it's not hard to identify them, to realize that we don't live in a particularly special moment in American history, and that they were Sam Alitos and George Bushes and whatever in every single generation going back to the Founding, they were idiots who could barely string a sentence together, and who were evil to their core, who now we're like, wow.</p>
                        <p>31:56 Rhiannon: And they were powerful.</p>
                        <p>31:56 Peter: At least now, it's like the power has just being passed down from generation to generation. Back then it was just like that man has the most horses in town. You are a Senator, good sir.</p>
                        <p>32:11 Michael: That's not actually that different from how it is today.</p>
                        <p>32:15 Rhiannon: So turning to how we could reform this dog shit system that those Founders gave us...</p>
                        <p>32:21 Peter: Yeah, what do you guys think about passing a constitutional amendment?</p>
                        <p>32:26 Rhiannon: So okay, okay, okay, let's back up and like... Yeah, okay. So as it stands, the number of electors each state gets is equal to the total number of seats that that state has in the House of Representatives, plus two for their Senators. But James Madison himself said that the framers who wrote the rules in the Constitution about the Electoral College had written the rules under "the hurrying influence produced by fatigue and impatience."</p>
                        <p>32:54 Peter: Ooh. Oh, yes, the hurrying influence.</p>
                        <p>32:54 Rhiannon: So cool thanks... Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:57 Peter: Thanks, James.</p>
                        <p>32:58 Michael: Who also produced this episode.</p>
                        <p>33:03 Peter: Yeah, no worries, though, James, I forgive you. You guys were in a rush and now our country is garbage. No problem, though.</p>
                        <p>33:09 Rhiannon: Thanks, bro. Thank you for your service. So doing away with the Electoral College altogether and just moving to a system of a straight popular vote for President and Vice President, that has enjoyed broad majority support, even in Congress. Michael mentioned this earlier. In 1969, for example, the House of Representatives did pass a constitutional amendment to establish a national popular vote for the White House, and even President Nixon was good with it. But a filibuster which was backed by segregationist Southerners in the Senate, killed it. So, racists. We've been like this all along.</p>
                        <p>33:47 Peter: And now... Look, 1969 was a long time ago in many ways. You wouldn't get even a little bit of support from Republicans for this now. Their entire project hinges on the Electoral College.</p>
                        <p>34:03 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>34:04 Peter: Constitutional amendments, in case anyone is unaware, require two-thirds majorities in both Houses. Impossible. Impossible.</p>
                        <p>34:11 Rhiannon: Right. So a constitutional amendment right now is definitely very much a pie in the sky concept in terms of abolishing the Electoral College, but just want to make the point that it's not unheard of historically.</p>
                        <p>34:23 Michael: Oh, yeah, no, it's not. And I just want to say to that point, I think there was actually a moment, I think in 2004, John Kerry lost by I think three points nationally, but only like by one point in Ohio, which could have flipped the Electoral College, and we could have had back-to-back elections where the popular vote winner lost the Electoral College. It was pretty close. Basically, what won the election for Bush in 2004 was a gay marriage ban on the ballot in Ohio that drove evangelical turnout, and pushed him over the line there.</p>
                        <p>34:56 Peter: Right. If Kerry had won and not won the popular vote in 2004...</p>
                        <p>34:58 Michael: I think it would have been gone.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Peter: That would have been a real moment where the country could have said, "Let's get rid of this bullshit."</p>
                        <p>35:02 Michael: Two straight elections with both parties benefiting or not benefiting, as the case may be.</p>
                        <p>35:10 Peter: Unfortunately, that was 1000 years ago.</p>
                        <p>35:10 Michael: Yes!</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>35:15 Rhiannon: That's definitely what it feels like. So in terms of other possible options for reforming the Electoral College, a lot of people have looked at the system and said, look, a simpler solution that gets us closer to an Electoral College that's more reflective of the popular vote is to expand the number of seats in the House of Representatives, make Congress bigger.</p>
                        <p>35:34 Peter: Which then in turn makes the Electoral College bigger.</p>
                        <p>35:37 Rhiannon: Exactly, and that's not a crazy concept. Currently, the House, of course, is capped at 435 members, and that's because of the Reapportionment Act of 1929, but Congress could just pass new legislation if it wanted to change that number, 435 isn't a magic number that's in the Constitution or anything like that. Congress used to pass legislation to expand the House every decade, and it just for a variety of reasons just stopped doing it in 1929.</p>
                        <p>36:04 Peter: There's only so many people you can fit in that room. They were like, "This is it. We're at capacity."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:08 Rhiannon: "That's it. We're not building another one of these."</p>
                        <p>36:09 Peter: There's like a fireman's coat on the door, and they're like, "That's it."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:11 Rhiannon: That's how they wrote this statute. But in fact, old James Madison himself, his original First Amendment, which did not get ratified, it would have equipped us with a really precise formula for the number of representatives in the House, and according to that formula, if we had adopted it, we would today have a House of Representatives with over 6000 members. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>36:38 Peter: I think it's great that Madison, his First Amendment idea was like, "I have this mathematical formula," and then everyone else was like, "You know, it should be you can say whatever you want. That's what I want." Everyone cheered, and that won the day.</p>
                        <p>36:54 Michael: One historical note I like about this is that Rhi said this was never ratified, and that's right, but there's actually some belief that maybe it was, that I think it was Connecticut, Connecticut actually ratified it in 1789 or something, and just people didn't notice, and so that in 1791, a final state ratified it, and it should have gone into effect, and it just didn't, and so I think in 2010 or 2012, somebody brought a case to the Supreme Court being like, "There should be 6000 people in the House." [chuckle] And the Court was like, "No." But they tried to get it recognized because they had this historical evidence that it had been ratified, which would have ruled.</p>
                        <p>37:32 Rhiannon: That would have been amazing.</p>
                        <p>37:33 Peter: That would have been actual judicial activism if they were like, "Yeah, it's 6000 members now."</p>
                        <p>37:37 Rhiannon: "Tomorrow, you guys need to have 6000 members showing up."</p>
                        <p>37:40 Michael: Good judicial activism.</p>
                        <p>37:41 Peter: Oh, hell, yeah, it would have been great.</p>
                        <p>37:44 Rhiannon: Okay, so there are obviously good reasons why a deliberative body that should be making laws and shit shouldn't be 6000 people big, but in terms of the Electoral College, by expanding the size of Congress by whatever measure, you end up with a state like California getting a lot more electorates. It could be 200 or 250, I don't know, while less populated states like Wyoming could remain about the same.</p>
                        <p>38:08 Michael: So what, so California's 80 times the population of Wyoming, so if its electoral votes were proportionate, instead of 55 electoral votes, it would have 240. That's how it's being disadvantaged here in the Electoral College compared to Wyoming.</p>
                        <p>38:24 Peter: Great system.</p>
                        <p>38:26 Rhiannon: And just want to give a really quick shout out to listener Casey, who wrote to us about this.</p>
                        <p>38:29 Peter: Yeah, marking the first genuinely intelligent communication we've received from a listener in the history of our podcast.</p>
                        <p>38:37 Michael: Not true, that's not true.</p>
                        <p>38:38 Peter: What's another one?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>38:43 Michael: So yeah, I actually really like this idea. It makes, for one thing, my understanding, at least I'm not like a super expert in this area, but my understanding is it makes gerrymandering much more difficult, which would be great, not only for political purposes, but also just on more fundamental fairness purposes, and it would make the Electoral College itself more fair by making the number of votes each state get a little more tied to the actual population and more reflective of the relative size of each state, such that Wyoming residents aren't getting seven times the influence or whatever it is than California residents. It seems good on a number of levels.</p>
                        <p>39:26 Peter: Absolutely, and yeah, we're joking about a 6000 member Congress, but of course it doesn't need to go that high. Doubling the number of representatives in the House would be hugely significant in terms of exactly reducing the sort of unfairness, the inherent undemocratic nature of the Electoral College.</p>
                        <p>39:45 Michael: Doing that would likely, for Democrats, at least in the short term, increase their political power by giving them, I think, a stronger foothold in the House of Representatives and in the Electoral College, while at the same time decreasing the political power of any individual representative, since they're going to be 1 out of 900 instead of 1 out of 435, which is why it'll never happen, because they are too fucking stupid to think about that maybe in a more powerful party, my influence could be more meaningful.</p>
                        <p>40:22 Peter: Right. They'd be in the short-term sacrificing their own sort of immediate power, and that would take some sort of balls and foresight to do, and I don't think they have balls and foresight.</p>
                        <p>40:31 Michael: There's no evidence that any of them have that, or very few of them, so...</p>
                        <p>40:35 Peter: We should also talk about the national popular vote interstate compact, which is this idea that states would agree to give their electors to whoever wins the nationwide popular vote. Now, obviously, this only works if enough states agree to it and not enough states have, and of course, Republican-governed states don't have an interest in doing that. But we should mention it because it's a way of sort of mitigating or eliminating the effects of the Electoral College without having to pass a constitutional amendment.</p>
                        <p>41:05 Michael: Right, and they're always quirky or weird times when something happens, there's a scandal and there's a wave election or whatever, there's a recession or a plague, and you find yourself in charge of a state that you were not previously in charge of as a Democrat, and I maybe have an opportunity, like a rare but slim opportunity. Doesn't Kansas, have a Democratic Governor right now? And you'd be surprised, sometimes there are moments, right? And like all you need is 270 electoral votes in this and then the Electoral College is dead.</p>
                        <p>41:40 Peter: So that's right. So we should talk about where the Supreme Court is in all of this chaos. Like we said, the Constitution is pretty vague on a lot of this stuff, and the Supreme Court, of course, has the final say on constitutional issues. So it's possible that questions about how some of the ins and outs of the Electoral College work get elevated to the Court. Hard to predict what the issues would be and how things would shake out, but one thing you can be certain of is that the conservatives on the Court will give zero weight to whether or not the mechanisms of the Electoral College deprive the people of their democratic voice or something.</p>
                        <p>42:21 Peter: And this is also what makes the expansion of Congress such a powerful option here. It's done by legislation, and there's really no question that the Constitution allows for it, there's just not much the Supreme Court could do about it. What we want to convey here is not just the Electoral College is impossibly stupid, although of course it is, and every time you hear a defense of it, it is a stupid defense. They'll say that a popular vote would sort of minimize the influence of certain states, and it's like the impact of every state would be directly proportionate to their population, which seems like a pretty reasonable way to do it.</p>
                        <p>42:55 Peter: The reasons that the Electoral College is stupid are quite obvious. The ways in which it can be taken advantage of by Trump next month to kind of engage in an overt coup are a little less obvious and it's unclear if they would work, it's unclear exactly how they would work, and a lot of that is because it's just never happened before. All of these mechanisms are sitting in the Constitution waiting to be used, right? There was probably some thought that they would be used with more frequency, but they haven't been. So you do have election scholars that know a lot more about this stuff than us saying, oh, this seems unlikely. But frankly, they don't know that, because no one knows this, because no one has really tread in this territory before.</p>
                        <p>43:44 Peter: What do you do when you get to a point where there is a party that has no interest in actual democracy and tons of interest in retaining power. There's really no way to know exactly how this could play out. We've described some of the mechanisms of the Electoral College and how they could aid in a Trump administration effort to hold on to control of the Presidency, but this is a shit show, I mean, this is complete and total mess, and that is honestly the takeaway of this episode.</p>
                        <p>44:16 Michael: A very compelling argument for the popular vote, even if you think the Electoral College has many merits, is just everything we just described about what Republicans are talking openly about doing and what they might be able to do. That's just an intolerable risk, like maybe they try and they fail, but maybe not, or maybe they don't fail in 2024. Why might even leave this mechanism lying around, it's just a loaded gun.</p>
                        <p>44:45 Peter: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>44:51 Peter: Alright, next week is a special episode on gerrymandering. We'll be talking primarily about the 2019 case, Rucho v. Common Cause. Follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod. Get well soon, President Trump.</p>

                        <p>0:00:00 Peter: Alright, everybody, we had a listener Q&A episode planned, but we have to put that on hold because we've just scored the interview of a lifetime, frankly.</p>
                        <p>0:00:08 Rhiannon: This is huge.</p>
                        <p>0:00:09 Michael: Very excited.</p>
                        <p>0:00:11 Peter: Amy Coney Barrett, Supreme Court nominee and likely the next Justice on the Court is on the line. Judge Barrett, welcome to the show.</p>
                        <p>0:00:18 Amy Coney Barrett: Thank you very much. I am so grateful for your kindness on this rather overwhelming occasion.</p>
                        <p>0:00:25 Peter: Yeah, sure. So first of all, congratulations. How are you doing?</p>
                        <p>0:00:31 Amy Coney Barrett: The President has nominated me to serve on the United States Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:00:39 Peter: Yeah, okay. We wanted to start by getting a sense of what your philosophy on interpreting the Constitution is. How would you describe it?</p>
                        <p>0:00:45 Amy Coney Barrett: I love the United States and I love the United States Constitution.</p>
                        <p>0:00:51 Peter: Right, right. Okay, so you'll be replacing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. Those are some pretty big shoes to fill. Are there any lessons that you take from her career?</p>
                        <p>0:01:03 Amy Coney Barrett: Particularly poignant to me was her long and deep friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia...</p>
                        <p>0:01:08 Peter: I'm sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but did you just say "poy-gnant?"</p>
                        <p>0:01:13 Amy Coney Barrett: Poygnant.</p>
                        <p>0:01:13 Peter: Are you trying to say poignant?</p>
                        <p>0:01:15 Amy Coney Barrett: Poygnant.</p>
                        <p>0:01:17 Peter: Poignant. The g sound is sort of old French, so it's poignant.</p>
                        <p>0:01:22 Amy Coney Barrett: Poygnant.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:01:23 Peter: Okay, it feels like we're hitting a wall here. I think we should probably just end this interview, unless Rhi or Michael, do you have any questions?</p>
                        <p>0:01:31 Rhiannon: No.</p>
                        <p>0:01:33 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>0:01:34 Peter: Okay, well, thanks. Thanks for coming on, Judge Barrett, and good luck at the hearings.</p>
                        <p>0:01:38 Amy Coney Barrett: Poignant.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:01:43 Peter: Alright, Leon, you can just do the intro, dude.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:01:48 Leon: Hey, everyone. This is Leon from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael talk about Donald Trump contracting COVID-19 and how the consequences might affect the Supreme Court. Also for the first time, the hosts are answering listener questions. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:02:16 Peter: Alright, folks, we're sorry about the interview falling apart there, we're just going to go with our scheduled programming, which is a special listener Q&A episode. So we've been taking questions for a few weeks and we're going to answer them to the best of our ability.</p>
                        <p>0:02:34 Michael: Not every one.</p>
                        <p>0:02:35 Rhiannon: Not all of them.</p>
                        <p>0:02:36 Peter: Not all of them. A lot of them were, I'm going to be honest, disappointing.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:02:42 Rhiannon: I might even say disturbing, some of them.</p>
                        <p>0:02:45 Peter: Yeah, before we get to listener questions, I think we need to talk a little bit about current events.</p>
                        <p>0:02:54 Rhiannon: There are a couple happening.</p>
                        <p>0:02:57 Peter: Yeah. As a country, we have been for years in a storm. Our lives, our bodies, our minds battered and eroded by ceaseless wind and rain. We've grown to know only the storm, only the suffering. We've become weary and hardened, but early this past Friday morning, for the first time anyone can remember, sunlight crested on the distant horizon. And while clouds still hang overhead, we could feel the sunbeams dancing briefly across our faces. Donald Trump has COVID-19. How are you guys feeling?</p>
                        <p>0:03:46 Michael: Oh, I feel fucking great.</p>
                        <p>0:03:47 Rhiannon: I have never felt more alive, more high. I can feel the blood running through my veins, I feel my heart pounding in my face.</p>
                        <p>0:03:57 Peter: Yeah, I might stop drinking. I just, I don't really feel like I need anything anymore. Things are developing quickly, so by the time you listen to this, you will almost certainly know more than we do now. But following Hope Hicks testing positive for COVID, Trump and Melania tested positive, Kellyanne Conway tested positive, Ronna McDaniel, Head of the Republican National Committee, tested positive, Chris Christie tested positive, Mike Lee and Senator Tillis, both Senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee, tested positive, and from what we can tell, this all traces back to the Amy Coney Barrett nomination press conference, where Republican top brass ran a public victory lap about replacing RBG.</p>
                        <p>0:04:42 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's more beautiful than I thought was possible.</p>
                        <p>0:04:45 Michael: Yeah. Right.</p>
                        <p>0:04:46 Peter: It is. And apparently, God had had enough. That was it, because the disease that these just endlessly selfish, effervescently stupid pieces of shit have been ignoring and downplaying for months has come to feast on their flabby decrepit bodies. How anyone can pretend this is not pure poetry is beyond me.</p>
                        <p>0:05:15 Michael: Oh, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:05:17 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:05:18 Michael: Ron Johnson, by the way, also testing positive, who was not at the super-spreader event and not on the Judiciary Committee, which means this has definitely leaked into the broader Republican caucus, which is beautiful.</p>
                        <p>0:05:30 Peter: Yeah, the Republican strategy of pretending this is not happening and all going to regular parties where they kiss each other has backfired.</p>
                        <p>0:05:40 Rhiannon: Right, right, yeah. And Michael, I know you are about to tell us about how this will affect Senate hearings and the procedures and stuff to come, but I think that I want to make a point about compassion. The news came out and inevitably, you get these fucking hand- wringers, these pearl-clutchers, who say that, I don't know, I'm a bad person because I got excited. You know what I mean? I felt good hearing the news that Trump got COVID.</p>
                        <p>0:06:12 Michael: Right, "You should wish him well, a quick recovery."</p>
                        <p>0:06:15 Rhiannon: Right, and, "We need to wish him well, because if we don't, then that makes us just as bad as them," and I want to say, fuck you, eat my dick...</p>
                        <p>0:06:25 Michael: That's right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:06:27 Rhiannon: Because that's not true. These are the people who an hour after Ruth Bader Ginsburg was announced dead, were absolutely giddy to say, "We will be replacing her ASAP," these are the people who are putting kids in cages, these are the people who are in charge of the government response to COVID-19 that has led to 200,000 dead.</p>
                        <p>0:06:48 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:06:49 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:06:49 Rhiannon: The role of people in government is to care about the people, to have compassion for the people, and to be enacting policies that sort of effectuate that compassion for the people. They don't fucking do that. It is not on me to show compassion for Donald Trump or any of his ugly disgusting fellow party members.</p>
                        <p>0:07:11 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:07:12 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:07:12 Peter: This is a better metaphor than I could ever even hope to conceptualize for how a boomerang works. These...</p>
                        <p>0:07:20 Rhiannon: [laughter] Yeah, for reaping what you sow, motherfuckers.</p>
                        <p>0:07:24 Peter: These people made it a central component of their career this year to downplay this disease.</p>
                        <p>0:07:29 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:07:29 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:07:29 Peter: And they really began to think, I think, that they were all immune. They really spent their lives just like so blessed with dumb fucking luck that they thought that this could only happen to other people.</p>
                        <p>0:07:42 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:07:42 Michael: Right. It's framed as empathy, like you should be an empathetic person, that this is what's decent and proper is to have... Think of like Trump is a human being and Melania is a human being, and we need to be decent. Here's the thing. I personally blame Trump for the death of my aunt. I know a lot of people blame Trump for the deaths of their parents, their children, their husbands and wives, to say nothing of businesses that folded, people who've gone bankrupt, their dreams fucking dashed. Telling them that they need to be wishing Trump well, telling me and framing that as empathy, no, that's fucking callous.</p>
                        <p>0:08:25 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:08:26 Michael: Where's your have empathy for me? Fuck you.</p>
                        <p>0:08:29 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:08:29 Michael: Absolutely fuck you.</p>
                        <p>0:08:30 Rhiannon: Exactly. Empathy and compassion don't get you into heaven, just thinking positive thoughts doesn't make you a good person. It's actions and what you do and your material harm or benefits that you give to other people, that's what makes you a good person.</p>
                        <p>0:08:47 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:08:48 Rhiannon: So tell us about the election, Michael.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:08:51 Peter: What does this mean, Michael, 'cause I don't know.</p>
                        <p>0:08:54 Michael: Okay, so there is a procedure for when a major party nominee dies, this is something that's been anticipated before. And the procedure is pretty what you'd expect. The party convenes, they have another convention and they nominate a new candidate, and the election essentially starts over. The issue here is that there just isn't enough time to do that, like printing ballots takes time, to say nothing of the fact that two million people, over two million people at the time of this recording have already voted. The train has left the station on this election, and the name on the ballot on November is going to be Donald Trump regardless of what happens.</p>
                        <p>0:09:34 Michael: So the question is, how do you go forward when one of the candidates on the ballot is dead, in this hypothetical. It's such a lovely thing just to contemplate. [chuckle] So the answer is it's going to vary state by state. As a preliminary point, we should assume that the Republican party is going to make Pence the new nominee, one way or another, maybe they have a convention, maybe it's sort of informal, but people understand that if you vote for Trump, you're voting for Pence.</p>
                        <p>0:10:06 Michael: The first thing to remember is that you don't vote for President, you vote for electors to the Electoral College. And so in states that zombie Trump wins, what the GOP is going to try to do is free up those electors to vote for Pence instead of Trump when the Electoral College convenes. Some states allow for this already, and that's like in their laws, others don't, and it would probably require getting courts involved. I don't think courts will actually be a hindrance to this. The Supreme Court recently had an Electoral College decision. They sort of left open this possibility. Here's the thing, though. Some state Republican Parties also might try to use the fact that it's a dead person on the ballot to invalidate Trump losing those states and trying to bypass the election results to directly appoint their electors to the Electoral College, and so Joe Biden wins Pennsylvania, but the Pennsylvania State Republican Party tries to pass a law or otherwise by legislative fiat to send Republican electors to the Electoral College.</p>
                        <p>0:11:21 Michael: That might sound crazy and dystopian, it's very much within the realm of possibility that they'll at least try it. We'll talk about this more on our Electoral College episode, which is next week, so get excited for that.</p>
                        <p>0:11:34 Rhiannon: Yay.</p>
                        <p>0:11:35 Michael: And the last point is that the body that counts the Electoral College votes, that accepts them, is Congress, and so there is a possibility that Congress could call into question or decline to accept the Electoral College votes of certain states if they get weird or funky with this. Or if they don't get weird or funky with it, right? If Pennsylvania does send Biden electors and then Republicans in Congress try to not get those electors counted and not accept them. So this could be a huge fucking mess. It'll be a disaster. It's a shit show that would be almost impossible to predict the precise contours of how it would turn out, but it would leave a lot of stuff up in the air.</p>
                        <p>0:12:23 Peter: Yeah. But there is one thing that we can be certain of, if Donald Trump dies of COVID-19, he cannot be President.</p>
                        <p>0:12:31 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:12:32 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:12:33 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:12:33 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's a guarantee.</p>
                        <p>0:12:36 Peter: That's the 5-4 guarantee, baby.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:12:45 Michael: All that stuff should make us concerned about the legitimacy of a Biden win in this scenario or a Pence win or whatever, but if he's dead, the likelihood that American democracy is smashed on the rocks of Donald Trump's ego and self-preservation gets significantly reduced. I think the far more likely scenario is that Republicans take their Amy Coney Barrett victory and lick their wounds and just move on to the next round of fights of obstructing President Biden. I don't think we're as likely to see the sorts of long-fought legal battles that Donald Trump has guaranteed us at this point, that he has promised are coming. I think there's an argument to be made, and not just an argument, I believe that Donald Trump living is a bigger threat to the legitimacy of this election than Donald Trump dying. I do. Despite the shit show I just described, there's a sense in which Donald Trump dying from COVID very well could save American democracy. I don't think that's an exaggeration to say. So yeah, setting aside the fact that I hate this piece of shit, there's a lot of reasons to celebrate this possibility, and American democracy is one of them.</p>
                        <p>0:14:01 Peter: Yeah. Well, we should certainly note that Amy Coney Barrett has tested negative, making her the only person who was at her press conference who will not die of COVID-19. The rumor is that she has had it before. If that's true, we don't yet know, but it seems like a possibility since she was open-mouth kissing everyone else there and doesn't have it now. But I think the implications for her confirmation hearing are less about her health right now, and more about the health of the senators on the Republican side of the Senate Judiciary Committee and whether or not it is safe to hold hearings, how exactly they would do it, it seems like they would be fine doing it remotely. Lindsey Graham has said that they will, but Republicans currently have a 12-10 advantage in the Judiciary Committee, so two of their senators being down is a big deal. Yeah, so we don't know what's going to happen, but certainly, the course of the confirmation hearings are potentially affected here.</p>
                        <p>0:15:03 Michael: Right. I think the best chance Democrats have for delaying her confirmation is if they are able to deny Republicans a quorum in the Senate, essentially...</p>
                        <p>0:15:13 Rhiannon: Right. In the Senate as a whole.</p>
                        <p>0:15:16 Michael: In the Senate as a whole. A quorum requires 51 members present from either party, the vice president does not count for that, so 50 senators from the Republican Party would not suffice. That being said, you need to make an objection if there's not a quorum present, which means a Democrat would need to be present, who would then create the 51st vote. So you need to be down to 49 Republicans present. There currently is not any provision for remote voting in the Senate or anything like that, so the quorum issue is real.</p>
                        <p>0:15:50 Rhiannon: Didn't McConnell say a couple of days ago, "No, no way. We're not doing virtual voting."</p>
                        <p>0:15:55 Michael: Yeah, I believe so. Yeah, so if there are enough Republicans, I think it would require four to be incapacitated and unable to attend, then Democrats by refusing to attend could deny them a quorum and delay the vote indefinitely. There are things the Republicans can do then, they can send the sergeant at arms to go round up the Democrats.</p>
                        <p>0:16:19 Peter: Who's the sergeant at arms?</p>
                        <p>0:16:20 Michael: Yeah, seriously.</p>
                        <p>0:16:21 Peter: It's like Stephen Miller.</p>
                        <p>0:16:22 Rhiannon: God.</p>
                        <p>0:16:23 Michael: The other thing is, if you're going to boycott this, don't just go to your townhouse in Bethesda or whatever, go back to Oregon, Ron Wyden, go back to California, Dianne Feinstein, just fucking leave.</p>
                        <p>0:16:35 Peter: Or be prepared to kill the sergeant at arms.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:16:41 Rhiannon: Those are your choices.</p>
                        <p>0:16:43 Michael: Yeah. So yeah, there are avenues to make this, at the very least, a huge spectacle. Definitely, they could almost certainly delay it, at least for some period of time. And who knows how many more Republicans are going to end up with COVID at this point. It feels like we're just at the beginning of this.</p>
                        <p>0:17:03 Peter: Fingers crossed, baby.</p>
                        <p>0:17:04 Michael: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>0:17:05 Rhiannon: Yeah, we can only hope now.</p>
                        <p>0:17:07 Peter: So let's take this celebratory mood and just... And the best way we know how, transition into answering some listener questions. So we've got some voicemails and we're going to play those questions, but we also have a lot of written questions, and for those, we're going to have our producer, Katya read them. So Katya, say hi.</p>
                        <p>0:17:31 Katya: Hey, guys.</p>
                        <p>0:17:32 Rhiannon: Katya.</p>
                        <p>0:17:33 Michael: Hey.</p>
                        <p>0:17:34 Rhiannon: KK is on the pod.</p>
                        <p>0:17:36 Michael: Our silent partner, our constant companion.</p>
                        <p>0:17:40 Peter: Alright, so Katya, do you want to hop right in here? Let's do it.</p>
                        <p>0:17:44 Katya: Yeah, let me just kick it off. I'm going to play this VM for you. We'll see where it goes.</p>
                        <p>0:17:50 Peter: Okay.</p>
                        <p>0:17:52 Speaker 7: Hi, 5-4 podcast, I'm a law student and I'm doing my law homework right now, and I know you guys are lawyers, and I'm just wondering, is it worth it? I'm sure you probably get asked this question all the time. Is it worth it? Thanks, guys. Love the podcast.</p>
                        <p>0:18:17 Peter: It is true that we get asked that question a lot, it's never quite that sad.</p>
                        <p>0:18:21 Rhiannon: [laughter] Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>0:18:23 Amy Coney Barrett: That is so bleak.</p>
                        <p>0:18:24 Peter: I've also never heard anyone use the term law homework.</p>
                        <p>0:18:29 Rhiannon: This poor person, it's the first semester of 1L.</p>
                        <p>0:18:33 Peter: It's been like two weeks of law school and that girl sounds like she has been a lawyer for 50 years.</p>
                        <p>0:18:40 Michael: My heart goes out to you, seriously, it does.</p>
                        <p>0:18:44 Rhiannon: Yeah, no, really.</p>
                        <p>0:18:44 Michael: In the previous episode, I mentioned that I don't think our listeners should hurt themselves, and I want to reiterate that point to this caller in particular.</p>
                        <p>0:18:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, we'll get into law school and the law and all of that stuff, but take care of yourself, and honestly, if you get to law school and don't want to do it, then fucking quit.</p>
                        <p>0:19:03 Michael: Yes, I know a lot of people who struggled their first semester, like 1L fall, and then were fine for the rest of the way. But you should probably get a pretty good idea within the first few months if this is or isn't for you. And if you are two months in and you're like, "This doesn't feel right," then trust yourself, you know yourself better than we do, and if that's what your heart is telling you, listen to it before you go 150 grand into debt.</p>
                        <p>0:19:32 Peter: Yeah. I do want to provide one caveat here, which is that there aren't a lot of good jobs, law can be pretty miserable, but, like what are you going to go into accounting, it's all really rough. There's like six good jobs and they're very competitive.</p>
                        <p>0:19:45 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:19:46 Michael: I'll say this, if you are struggling that much emotionally, you're not absolutely killing it, if it's not like A's and 150 grand payout within a couple of years in exchange for that sort of misery, like I think you gotta go find something that works better for you.</p>
                        <p>0:20:02 Peter: And either way, keep listening to the podcast, baby. Alright, here we go. Listener questions.</p>
                        <p>0:20:08 Speaker 8: Hello, I am calling to ask if you guys can reflect on the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, and what were the problems they were dealing with then, as far as getting that bill passed. I'd also like to say thank you for making this wonderful podcast. I'm not a lawyer, but my partner is, and it gives us something to talk about in her career field. And it's always nice to hear Law Boy's clinking whiskey glass in the background.</p>
                        <p>0:20:40 Michael: What?</p>
                        <p>0:20:40 Peter: Wow. [laughter] Huge mistake.</p>
                        <p>0:20:41 Michael: What?</p>
                        <p>0:20:43 Rhiannon: Number one, huge mistake. Number two, I love that the podcast gives you something to talk about with your wife.</p>
                        <p>0:20:48 Peter: Yeah, that sounds like things are going great over there.</p>
                        <p>0:20:50 Rhiannon: Yeah. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:20:54 Michael: I am the clinking glass guy, let's be clear. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:20:56 Rhiannon: That's Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:20:57 Peter: That's right. So, this question is an extremely nerdy way of asking about FDR's court-packing plan.</p>
                        <p>0:21:02 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:21:03 Peter: First of all, I don't believe that there's a lot to be learned from history. So I'm just going to keep this one short.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:21:10 Peter: But one of the big lessons of FDR's court-packing plan, even though it failed, was that you could leverage the threat of court-packing, which he did successfully in several cases, to sort of ensure that the Supreme Court upheld New Deal legislation, right? So he was sort of dangling, at various points, the threat of court-packing over the Court's head and saying, "If you don't uphold these laws, I'm going to move forward with this." And even though the court-packing plan failed, the threat of it was actually, in some ways, a success.</p>
                        <p>0:21:44 Michael: Right. And I do want to say, maybe there are some political lessons to be learned there. That's not really the focus of this podcast, but you're thinking the right thing, right now, if you're looking at a 6-3 Court and thinking, "Well, how can we change this?" That's where the mindset needs to be, but the question is, how do we put pressure on the government as it's currently constituted, or hopefully how it's constituted in a month from now, two months from now, to effect that change.</p>
                        <p>0:22:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, one big lesson to be learned is that we can and should exert political pressure on the Supreme Court to act the way a federal court should act. There are mechanisms already built into the system to do this. We can reform the Court by legislation through statutes if we want to, and we should have all those options on the table.</p>
                        <p>0:22:40 Leon: Okay, cool, let's stick with this court reform stuff. Maddie is asking, "I was hoping you could talk about proposed Supreme Court reforms like term limits, set number of appointees per President, court-packing, removing the Justices, and having federal circuit court judges preside on a rotation."</p>
                        <p>0:23:02 Peter: Yeah. So Michael, I'll let you go off in a second, but I do want to say one thing about this, which is, there's no reform that is going to separate out politics and the Court.</p>
                        <p>0:23:11 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:23:12 Peter: That's not something that's actually a plausible or even really desirable goal. That's sort of meaningless, right? You can't separate out ideology and the practice of law. So when you're talking about Court reform, what you're really talking about is just shifting power. Right now, there is disproportionate conservative power in the Supreme Court and the federal courts, generally. If you are coming at this either from the perspective of us on the left, or if someone who wants to see more balance, then reform should be geared towards increasing the power of the liberal and left justices, liberal and left legal academics, etcetera, within these institutions. You can't create a framework under which politics and the law are somehow 100% separate. It's just not possible. So yes, there are tons of court reform options. There aren't any court reform options that are going to sort of create this platonic ideal court that is separate from ideology, somehow.</p>
                        <p>0:24:10 Rhiannon: Right. An objective court. That's not how it works.</p>
                        <p>0:24:13 Michael: I think some reforms are sort of geared towards this idea that maybe we could lower the stakes of any particular nomination, and in the course of doing so it would sort of... It would let some of the heat out of this and make everything just feel a little calmer. So these would be like, for example, term limits. The idea with term limits and a fixed number of Justices being appointed by every President, the idea would be like, "Look, if you didn't win this round, you just win the next round." And then you get to appoint Justices. And so there's less at stake. You know that the next election cycle, you have a chance to appoint two Justices yourself. Maybe that's true in the abstract, same with the idea of a popular proposal.</p>
                        <p>0:24:56 Michael: Bernie Sanders talked about this, where you wouldn't have a Supreme Court, you'd have a rotating panel of Justices pulled from the appellate circuits to hear those cases. Same idea that, like, "Well, now you're talking about hundreds of appellate judges, instead of one out of nine Supreme Court Justices." I don't think that's right, to be frank. For example, we've already seen the overt politicization of the appellate circuit and district circuit nominating process. The last 12 years is an object lesson in the Republican party showing how easy it is to obstruct the opposite party from appointing district and federal appellate judges. And then when you have power, appointing them yourselves en masse and taking a stranglehold control of several federal circuits, which really changes the inflection of the federal courts as a whole. That's something you can do.</p>
                        <p>0:25:55 Michael: So I don't think those are necessarily the answer. We have to be clear-eyed about what our goals are here, which is, we want more political power so we can do things we think will improve people's lives and make the country more fair and more just. And there's a very simple and clear answer to that, which is just expand the size of the court and appoint four or six Justices who are our allies. That's it.</p>
                        <p>0:26:23 Peter: A lot of the concern is people are like, "Well, when the Republicans get power again, they're going to do the same thing." And yes, of course. That's sort of a given. They already kind of leverage their power to the best of their ability, so we could expect them to meet the Democrats there. The challenge for them is that if we had a Democratic-led Supreme Court, they might have trouble winning elections without completely reforming their political strategy for the next 50 years. I mean...</p>
                        <p>0:26:48 Michael: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:26:49 Peter: Like we've mentioned many times in the past month or two on this podcast, free and fair elections in America would lead to the decimation of Republican party as it stands right now. And so, would they be able to turn the tables theoretically? Yes, absolutely. And I think they'd be willing to.</p>
                        <p>0:27:03 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>0:27:04 Peter: Will they even really get the chance? I don't know.</p>
                        <p>0:27:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's what I was just going to say is the sort of tit for tat argument that like, "Oh, well, Republicans, once they get to be the president again or whatever, will just do court-packing their way." The power built in the meantime is worth it, though. In the short term, the options are pack the court or do nothing. I don't think there's a realistic choice between those two. I think like Democrats, liberal, left of center, whatever, we have to expand the Court, pack the Court, do this, because in the short term, we need to be gaining and building as much power as possible. And maybe when things like progressive legislation is passed, like a Green New Deal, like Medicare for All, all of those things, we need as soon as possible a Court that's going to uphold that stuff for us. And then, what flows out of that is a more secure and just society and democracy where the people have more power. And then we can ask ourselves about strategies down the line with like, "Oh, well, now Republicans are even more of a minority and they want to be doing tricks on the federal bench."</p>
                        <p>0:28:16 Michael: Right. I want to just talk really quickly about actual legislation. Ro Khanna, who I greatly admire, introduced a Term Limits Bill in the House.</p>
                        <p>0:28:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:28:25 Michael: Obviously, that's not going to get any support in the Senate. Who knows if it's even going to get majority support in the House right now, but it's interesting. One thing that's interesting about it is that it doesn't impose term limits on the current Justices, which creates a scenario where it's not clear who, if anyone, would even be able to constitutionally challenge this law. But I don't think this is the ultimate avenue to go here, because even in the ideal scenario, we're talking about five to seven years, assuming no untimely deaths, before Democrats would have a majority on the Court. That means winning re-election in 2024, which is no given.</p>
                        <p>0:29:05 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:29:06 Michael: If you have an opportunity to exercise power in January 2021, you have to give yourself a win. You can't give yourself something that looks good and you might benefit from in five to seven years.</p>
                        <p>0:29:18 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:29:18 Michael: Things are too close right now.</p>
                        <p>0:29:20 Rhiannon: Yeah. We need it now.</p>
                        <p>0:29:23 Michael: We're too much on the precipice. We need this fixed now.</p>
                        <p>0:29:28 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:29:29 Katya: Alright. Andrew asks, and he's referencing a few articles here published recently in late September, and he says, "All of these people have proposed some variant of Dems are too concerned with court-packing. The real issue is constitutional review, and the next president should just declare that the rulings of the Supreme Court do not have constitutional weight."</p>
                        <p>0:29:53 Peter: Yeah, so for everyone who doesn't know, the argument here is that instead of packing the court, Democrats could simply ignore Supreme Court rulings. And the basic concept is that there's nothing in the Constitution itself that says the Supreme Court is the final say on constitutional issues. The Supreme Court essentially granted itself that power over 200 years ago in Marbury v. Madison. So you could treat what the Court says as basically being advisory rather than binding and just say, "Look, thanks for weighing in but we disagree."</p>
                        <p>0:30:23 Peter: I think that people are drawn to that idea, because the idea of simply ignoring the Court is appealing in its simplicity. And it's something we should think about and maybe in certain situations might be more useful than in others. In a general sense, it seems like the appeal here is that you avoid the sort of political calamity of attempting to pack the Court, for example. But I'm not sure that flatly stating you will not abide by the Court is much better on that front or sort of creating a stand-off between two branches of government can be done without significant political consequence. The Court can direct members of government to obey their orders, and if they refuse, could order their imprisonment, for example, for contempt.</p>
                        <p>0:31:04 Peter: So is the Court ordering some poor bureaucrat to take action against sitting members of the government because they ignored a court order the simple solution here? I don't really think so. Not to mention every Republican jurisdiction in this country will immediately start violating the Equal Protection Clause, and you'd have to figure out how to handle that. So are there situations where this seems useful? Sure. If there were Green New Deal legislation being proposed by the Democrats that the court found unconstitutional, there is some merit to being like, "No, no, thanks. We're going to keep going." But absent a really specific discrete situation like that where it'd be beneficial, I don't think it's the best option available. I think that court-packing gives you all the advantages with fewer downsides.</p>
                        <p>0:31:49 Michael: Right, I agree. Packing the court is a simple matter of passing a law and signing it. It's a basic function of government that is in every sense of the word legitimate. Do you know what's illegitimate, though, is when, for example, this month, a federal court ordered that the Trump administration continue the census till the end of October, and the Trump administration said "No." And everybody understands that this is done purposefully to disadvantage minorities, disadvantage urban areas, and ultimately disadvantage Democrats, Democratic districts, Democratic states in their representation in Congress. And they're just going to do it, and there's not much redress. And that's a problem, and it's not a problem that we necessarily want to make routine.</p>
                        <p>0:32:36 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:32:36 Michael: If Republicans are going to keep doing stuff like that, they're going to keep doing it. There's not much we can do about it, but at the very least, we can say, "Well, look, this is bullshit." And not like, "Well, yeah. Well, we do that too."</p>
                        <p>0:32:49 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:32:50 Katya: Okay, guys, that was really smart, but I gotta pay my rent, so we're going to go to an ad now.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:33:00 Katya: Alright, this is going to be a hard-hitting one from the voicemails.</p>
                        <p>0:33:05 Elson: Hi, my name is Elson, I am a recent college grad, thinking about a career in law. So I just have a very important question, which is, do you guys think that being lawyers has helped or hurt your chances of getting laid?</p>
                        <p>0:33:19 Peter: Okay. Yeah, hurt.</p>
                        <p>0:33:21 Rhiannon: Definitely hurt.</p>
                        <p>0:33:23 Michael: Hurt.</p>
                        <p>0:33:23 Jacob: Hey, guys, my name is Jacob, I'm a listener from the great state of Iowa. Against your advice and my better judgment, I have decided to enroll in law school on the 1L this fall. I don't take con law until the spring, but I'm a big fan of the pod and listening since the first episode. So I just wanted to see whether you guys have any advice about how to make FEDSOC people cry during class discussions.</p>
                        <p>0:33:56 Michael: Right attitude.</p>
                        <p>0:33:58 Jacob: I'm really hoping to make that happen and looking forward to your insights. Thanks.</p>
                        <p>0:34:03 Rhiannon: Okay, first of all, you have the right idea, if you are going to go to law school, which is fucking dumb, you should be doing it with this attitude, at least.</p>
                        <p>0:34:11 Peter: We should make clear that the question is, "How to make Federalist Society members cry during class?" Not everyone knows the term FEDSOC, so I just want to make that clear.</p>
                        <p>0:34:20 Michael: Not everybody knows what the Federal Society is. It's a Republican organization churning out robot judges, who want to take all your rights away.</p>
                        <p>0:34:28 Peter: Yeah, and it has a huge student outreach branch. It's a big presence on just about every law school campus. In terms of how to make them cry during class discussions, I would say it depends on the individual weaknesses of the person you're dealing with. But I would say that a good reliable go-to, just physical violence. You could also use logic, I guess, if you're good at that.</p>
                        <p>0:34:52 Michael: In terms of classroom topics, say that you think Antonin Scalia is stupid and racist. Originalism is stupid. Textualism is stupid and a lie.</p>
                        <p>0:35:02 Rhiannon: The point of this is that making these FEDSOC losers cry, is actually pretty easy. My first day of law school orientation 1L, there was a book discussion, and the book that my small group chose to discuss was The New Jim Crow, and a man came to that discussion to argue that criminal justice reform and over-police of Black and Brown people is not a racial justice issue. So these people are fucking idiots, dude, and you can make them cry really easily.</p>
                        <p>0:35:39 Michael: Also, every 1L Crim class has at least one awkward day, where you discuss rape, and there's going to be somebody who says something stupid and really offensive, it happens every year, in every section, and if you want to make a FEDSOC guy cry, all you gotta do is make sure that you think consent is necessary to avoid rape. You raise your hand and be like, "Look, I just want to be on record, that consent is like an element of not raping someone." They'll be pissed.</p>
                        <p>0:36:13 Peter: If you start losing a debate to a Federalist Society person, the key is to turn the tables by asking them how their Title IX investigation is going.</p>
                        <p>0:36:24 Katya: Alright, this is a good segue, because the next question is, "Do we really want a leftist version of the Federalist Society? If the Supreme Court isn't actually some deliberative club of legal scholars, analytically solving complicated issues and is instead just dudes being guys trying to keep suburbs segregated, what would a liberal Federalist Society accomplish?"</p>
                        <p>0:36:50 Peter: Yeah, well, so first things first, the Federalist Society is about promoting a specific view of the law, which then gets taught to students, which it then uses to promote and get conservative judges installed in the judiciary. They have a complicated and vast network of people and institutions that are designed to do this. So should the left be engaging in that? Absolutely, of course, there needs to be a response. And we can see what happens without an adequate response to the Federalist Society, the judiciary is vastly disproportionately conservative, they have the ear of every major Republican politician, Republican presidents speak at their events, they're deeply connected to the party. So does the left need a response to that? Of course, it's separate and apart from just how they interpret the law.</p>
                        <p>0:37:42 Michael: Right, and I think we all say, but I know specifically that I say a lot, that talking about formalistic reasoning, this shit doesn't matter. What I mean is, we're a very outcome-focused podcast and we care about the output of judicial decisions, "Will this woman have her rights vindicated after the cops let her ex-husband kill her kids?" And in that sense, those things don't matter, originalism and textualism doesn't matter, but it doesn't mean they don't matter at all. It's propaganda, and propaganda exists and is used by both political parties and by political actors, throughout time and history and across the world, because it's effective, it's important, it adds legitimacy to everything you're trying to do.</p>
                        <p>0:38:31 Michael: The Supreme Court is engaged in a massive project of social engineering right now, where they are fundamentally reshaping the way power is distributed in our country, and part of that is doing it in a way where people aren't in the fucking streets rioting, and keeping people placated in thinking that all this change is legitimate and like an output of democracy, that's a part of it. And so, yeah, we need academics and we need activists who are coming up with arguments that will give legitimacy to whatever sort of social engineering a progressive Court would do. And what we want is a progressive Court that would engage in a lot of social engineering and create a society that is far more fair and just and equal. And that's where it gets legitimacy.</p>
                        <p>0:39:25 Peter: Yeah, look, we critique formalistic reasoning, but the legal profession operates on that framework, so you can reject its usefulness as a matter of theory, but if you want to be able to effectively fight for people's rights within the legal system as it exists, you need to understand it and be able to utilize it. You can't build a sort of legal response to the right by simply operating outside of the system.</p>
                        <p>0:39:46 Rhiannon: Yeah, as a public defender, somebody who defends people in court, my strategy, the way I practice the law is not going to court and begging a judge for mercy or being in a fit of tears because what's happening is sad.</p>
                        <p>0:40:00 Peter: Please don't be mean to my client, your Honor.</p>
                        <p>0:40:01 Rhiannon: Right, right, right. I make arguments that are based in laws, I read and research the law, I look to case law for winning arguments, there's legal strategy that we have to use as lawyers to fight for our causes, it's not all just bullshit.</p>
                        <p>0:40:18 Michael: And I do think there are a lot of these issues where like reasonable minds could disagree. And it's important to have an answer, like it is, it's important to persuade people, and there are a lot of true believers in the Federalist Society. I don't think any of them hold any positions of note, and I don't think any of them actually end up as judges, to be honest, but I think a lot of the rank and file believe in the principles, and I think it's important to have a similar rank and file who believe in a living Constitution and the values professed by a legal left, whatever that might look like.</p>
                        <p>0:40:57 Katya: Alright, let's go to the next one. This seems really important.</p>
                        <p>0:41:00 Rhiannon: Okay.</p>
                        <p>0:41:01 Olivia: Hey, 5-4 pod, this is Olivia, I'm a leftist and I'm interested in organizing and making the world slightly less shitty than it is. Do you think law would be an outlet for someone with those interests? Tell Rhiannon I love her. Thank you.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:41:23 Rhiannon: That was very sweet.</p>
                        <p>0:41:25 Michael: We all love Rhiannon, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:41:27 Rhiannon: Thank you. Olivia, I love you too, number one, little baby angel. Number two, I did get a look at some of the questions, and I know that a lot of people asked about like, "If you want to make the world a better place, if you want to do organizing, if you want to do social justice, should I go to law school?" And I think if you have a really specific idea of what you want to do and law school gets you there, then I think going to law school is fine. A lot of people ask me, "As a public defender, how do you feel? Because at the end of the day, being a public defender means that you end up helping a lot of people plead guilty, you're just a cog in the system, right? You're just moving cases the way the court system moves them, they come in, you spit them out, all of that." And I have a couple of things to say in response to that. One is, I don't know of another job to have, where you are like the perfect, most ethical, social justice, anti-capitalist, like maybe teaching, teaching high school social studies, maybe?</p>
                        <p>0:42:27 Peter: No way, doesn't count.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:42:29 Rhiannon: I don't know what the other thing is. In the current system we have, which is unjust, every job you're going to have is going to be fucked up.</p>
                        <p>0:42:36 Peter: Yeah, there's no job where you're not a cog in a system, by the way.</p>
                        <p>0:42:39 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly. Like that's just not...</p>
                        <p>0:42:40 Peter: That's like just a dumb fucking critique.</p>
                        <p>0:42:42 Rhiannon: That's not attainable. So if you want to make a difference and the law is an area where you want to make a difference, then yeah. The only other thing that I will say is the debt burden of going to law school is fucking insane, and so I do think that either you have a plan for dealing with the debt burden or you get a scholarship somewhere, or those kinds of things. I mean, just taking on $200,000 in debt to go to law school, I don't just advise to do that.</p>
                        <p>0:43:10 Peter: Yeah, my advice to you, Olivia, is you've got a few years before you graduate, try to come up with a quarter million dollars in that time.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:43:19 Rhiannon: No, Olivia, you sound super smart, you're going to get a scholarship somewhere, like...</p>
                        <p>0:43:23 Peter: No, you want to get the money, if you can, just in case you don't get a scholarship, so just try to get the quarter million, Olivia, that's priority number one.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:43:31 Michael: Right. Okay, I'd like to seriously weigh in here.</p>
                        <p>0:43:34 Peter: You have a plan on how to get that money?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:43:38 Michael: I think it's natural that the output of politics is law, and our society is structured by law, and so if you are interested in restructuring our society, there's a degree to which interest in the law makes sense.</p>
                        <p>0:43:53 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:43:54 Michael: I don't think legal careers, for the most part, are good avenues for effecting that sort of change. They're like within that structure that you want to change and they're not geared towards that. There are maybe a few, impact litigation and things like that, which can be big enough and affect the government or affect a company's bottom line enough that it could lead to some sort of incentive change or a regulatory change or something, but those jobs are very few, very far between, and highly competitive.</p>
                        <p>0:44:28 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:44:28 Michael: That doesn't mean legal fluency is unimportant, but going into 200 grand worth of debt for legal fluency is a questionable decision if that's your goal, and so you need to be realistic about what your monetary situation is, what your future career could look like and what you want to do, because if your career is going to be a legal career, changing the system is very likely not something you're going to be able to do.</p>
                        <p>0:44:58 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:45:00 Michael: At least not on your company time, maybe in your free time.</p>
                        <p>0:45:02 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>0:45:02 Rhiannon: I think that's right, and I think there's also something to be said about the practice of environmental law.</p>
                        <p>0:45:07 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>0:45:07 Peter: Yeah, something to be said would be, "Don't go into it."</p>
                        <p>0:45:09 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. I will never forget being in 1L, and I don't remember where this woman worked, but she had gone to my law school and she was coming back to talk to students about her work, and she kept talking about how she practices environmental law and how great that is, right? And somebody asked like, "Okay, so what do you do every day?" And it turns out actually, she works for a big law firm, so she actually represents big corporations in environmental law and stuff like that. I will never forget, somebody asked her like, "What do you do, what issues do you work on?" And she literally said, "Well, like sometimes they'll just say that the company killed a thousand dolphins, and you have to step in and be like, 'Okay, it wasn't a thousand, it was like 400 dolphins.'" Like that's what the practice of environmental law...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:46:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:46:01 Peter: That woman makes $1.5 million a year.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:46:03 Rhiannon: And that woman makes a lot of money. So yeah, I think what Michael said is spot on. You first want to think about what role do you want to have in social justice and all of that. And then think about the limitations of what law jobs are going to give you. One last thing is, who you want to serve. For me as a public defender, I directly represent individual clients. So yeah, it doesn't matter in the system necessarily that in a conservative Texas jurisdiction, I helped ten people on a Monday morning plead guilty to something and get probation or whatever. It means a fuck of a lot to each of my individual clients, that somebody was there who fought for them, who screamed at the cops or made an argument in court on their behalf, when otherwise a person other than me or no lawyer at all would have helped them. And so if you're talking about change, if you're talking about influence and putting progressive values in practice, then to my clients and their families, this practice of law means a fuck of a lot, even if I'm not overturning the system every day.</p>
                        <p>0:47:15 Michael: Right, yeah, I think that's an important point. There's good work you can do in the law. There is. I think there are very few jobs that are without qualifier.</p>
                        <p>0:47:26 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:47:27 Katya: Alright, guys, let's do a couple of factual questions. Okay, what happens if a SCOTUS case is 4-4? And what happens if there is no majority?</p>
                        <p>0:47:38 Peter: Yeah, so when there's a tie on the Supreme Court, the lower court ruling stands. So I imagine that any question about a 4-4 tie is anticipating an election case where Amy Coney Barrett has not been confirmed and what happens. So yeah, the answer is that whatever the court below held would remain, so it could be either a federal circuit court or a state supreme court, but that's all that happens. So it depends what happens below, and let's say that there's a lower court that rules in favor of Trump, a lot of people have floated the idea that maybe Roberts would really enjoy a tie that kind of deflects blame off the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>0:48:19 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:48:19 Peter: It's like, "We didn't really do anything."</p>
                        <p>0:48:21 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:48:22 Katya: Okay. Ben asks, "I read a lot about the shadow docket. Can you explain what that is and how it works?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:48:34 Michael: I fucking hate the shadow docket.</p>
                        <p>0:48:37 Peter: Yeah, alright. So the shadow docket is what refers to any cases that the Supreme Court gets that are not on its official docket. So it has an official docket going into the term, but then cases can be brought to the Supreme Court outside of those constraints. Again, in the case of an election case, right? There's not an election case literally on the Supreme Court's docket, but one might get elevated to the Supreme Court essentially because it's an emergency and so the Supreme Court hears it.</p>
                        <p>0:49:09 Michael: Right. And the vast majority of them in a regular year are cases that the Supreme Court decides without oral argument or necessarily even much briefing. And a lot of it will be like, are they going to stay a ruling below. Which means, are they going to put a ruling on hold or are they just going to summarily reverse it or summarily uphold it. Things like that. You don't read three sentence orders in law school, right?</p>
                        <p>0:49:34 Rhiannon: Right. Exactly. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>0:49:35 Michael: That say, reconsider in light of X case or whatever. Or you don't read an opinion staying a judgment until the court gets to hear it more fully but they have massive implications for how courts behave. That's sort of the way the shadow docket works and that's why it's called the shadow docket. It is because you don't read the decisions, you don't hear about them but they cast a long shadow.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:50:04 Peter: Are we sure that's why? I thought it was in the shadows.</p>
                        <p>0:50:06 Michael: No, it's in the shadows. It is in the shadows but I found myself committed to the improper metaphor there. I was very embarrassed about it.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:50:15 Rhiannon: Go, talk your shit, king.</p>
                        <p>0:50:18 Peter: I think that one reason the shadow docket's been written about a bunch recently is because the Roberts Court in particular seems to be utilizing it to make a lot of important decisions that sort of fly under the PR radar. It's hard for legal journalists and regular journalists especially to understand what's happening on the shadow docket because there's just a lot of procedural stuff for the most part. So the Court is using that sort of inherent secrecy to push a lot of what's frankly fairly conservative agenda and get it done without it hitting the headlines.</p>
                        <p>0:50:56 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>0:50:57 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:50:58 Katya: This is from Kent, what is in your opinion the most harmful SCOTUS decision in practice to the American people? I'm going to open that up. And you also get to talk about what is the best decision.</p>
                        <p>0:51:13 Rhiannon: Okay.</p>
                        <p>0:51:13 Peter: Alright.</p>
                        <p>0:51:13 Rhiannon: So we talk a lot about bad decisions on this podcast. So there are a lot of them that are terrible, but maybe I would like to talk about my favorite decision, which it's not going to be a surprise, is Gideon versus Wainwright. Gideon versus Wainwright is a 1963 decision of the Warren Court era that made it so that if you are poor, you must be provided an attorney if you are at risk of going to jail or being incarcerated for a crime. What I really like about Gideon versus Wainwright is that it is a recognition, which I think is rare from the Supreme Court, especially today, about how powerful the state can be in a person's life and how laws operate in real people's lives. I don't take it as, lawyers are so important. It's not like an ego boost or anything, it's just I like the realism of it, right? It's a decision that looks at how the law operates in people's lives and can ruin a person's life and says you need a lawyer before the state tries to do this to you. Peter, what's your least favorite?</p>
                        <p>0:52:29 Peter: Yeah, okay. I guess it depends on how you define the worst decision and how abstract you want to be. In terms of direct impact, Dred Scott allowed for the expansion of slavery across the country. Plessy v. Ferguson legalized segregation. I feel like most people go for those as one and two as the worst decisions. If you want to get a little more abstract, without Bush v. Gore putting Bush in office, you don't get a million dead in the Iraq War, without which you don't get ISIS, and so on and so on. So I think my dark horse candidate for a worst case would be Bush v. Gore because it sort of created ISIS.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:53:05 Rhiannon: When you think about it. Yeah. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:53:07 Michael: No, I think that's fair. I think not just ISIS, but also maybe the modern security state, right? It's hard to say.</p>
                        <p>0:53:13 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>0:53:15 Michael: Under a Gore presidency, we might not have this awful tech Panopticon that we live in.</p>
                        <p>0:53:21 Peter: There also might be... 'Cause Gore did talk about climate change and stuff, and I doubt he would have enacted something sufficient, but there is a possible reality where the ball is rolling in a more substantial way on climate change issues because of Gore, so Bush v. Gore might have completely destroyed the Earth.</p>
                        <p>0:53:40 Michael: Right. Right, and the other thing is, there's sort of an assumption that Gore loses after 2004, but maybe 9/11 has a rally round the flag effect regardless, and he wins and Rehnquist dies and we have a progressive Supreme Court. I don't know. There is a possible world out there where it's just like this compounding, bountiful...</p>
                        <p>0:54:01 Peter: Yeah. The best-case scenario of a Gore win because of no Bush v. Gore is very, very good, but we probably wouldn't have a podcast, so is that really the future you want to be living in?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:54:10 Rhiannon: Yeah. Yeah. Wait a minute. Not worth it. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>0:54:15 Peter: And if the planet has to die for us to have a medium successful legal podcast, then so be it.</p>
                        <p>0:54:24 Michael: In terms of... I do think we do talk a lot about Supreme Court cases we despise, so I want to take this opportunity to discuss a Supreme Court case I like. One I've mentioned in a recent previous episode, which is Miranda v. Arizona. And I like it because it is an instance where the Court sort of did something a little different, which is where it said like, "We shouldn't have to wait until your rights are violated." The whole decision is infused with this idea where it says like, "Look, cops have this deep institutional knowledge on how to coerce confessions from people. They know how to isolate you, how to get you in a compliant mindset, and they know how to draw something out of you. Something that's illegitimate, something that's unconstitutional, something that's unreliable, that's something that shouldn't be admitted to court, and they were like, "We shouldn't have to wait until they do that, and then litigate it after the fact. It's intolerable that too much injustice will be let through, and so we're just going to say, 'This is what you have to fucking do to avoid that.'"</p>
                        <p>0:55:33 Michael: It's a perfect example of how this sort of restrained idea of what courts can and should do is inherently conservative and, honestly, stupidly and artificially limited, right? In a lot of senses, Miranda is the most ambitious decision the Supreme Court has ever held where it said, "Perspectively, the agents of the state have to do X, Y and Z. We're giving them a prescription on what they have to do, and otherwise, whatever they do doesn't matter. Their testimony's thrown out of court. They have to do this, or you're essentially free to go."</p>
                        <p>0:56:11 Rhiannon: I love that, and I think that's related to Gideon. We are affirmatively saying, "It's future looking. This is how we can protect people's rights."</p>
                        <p>0:56:20 Michael: Right. It's the court flexing its muscle in a way that was so controversial that there was 30-plus years of debate about whether or not this was even a constitutional ruling, whether it could be overruled by legislation. Congress tried to overrule it, and it wasn't until the late '90s when it was before the Supreme Court in issue where the Court finally had to say, "Look, this was a constitutional ruling. It binds everyone. It binds the Feds. It binds the states. This is it. You have to fucking do this. You have to give Miranda warnings, and if you don't, we're just going to presume that any admissions you get are coerced and inadmissible."</p>
                        <p>0:57:01 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>0:57:01 Michael: It's fantastic, and it's like the Court should be more creatively along these lines. I don't think it's a surprise that this is one of the most easily recognizable to the layperson. A decision, the name itself, then what it says and what it means.</p>
                        <p>0:57:15 Rhiannon: And a symbol internationally of American democracy, right? People know what a Miranda warning is, and it's distinctly American in the sort of way that it's supposed to be protecting people's individual rights.</p>
                        <p>0:57:28 Michael: Right, and it is an example of the Court saying, "We're not bound by all this bullshit that you say we're bound by. We can do what we fucking want and we don't think you should be able to draw confessions out of people, and we're going to tell cops you can't." It's awesome. It rules. It's the height, I think, of Supreme Court jurisprudence.</p>
                        <p>0:57:46 Rhiannon: It rules.</p>
                        <p>0:57:47 Michael: It does. It's the fucking...</p>
                        <p>0:57:48 Rhiannon: It does.</p>
                        <p>0:57:50 Michael: It's the best.</p>
                        <p>0:57:50 Rhiannon: No. It's great.</p>
                        <p>0:57:50 Michael: I love Miranda. I do. I do. I love it.</p>
                        <p>0:57:53 Peter: What's the last one?</p>
                        <p>0:57:54 Leon: A lot of people do want to know what you guys are drinking. We got a lot of queries about the ice cubes. People want to know.</p>
                        <p>0:58:03 Peter: The ice cubes are all Michael. That's...</p>
                        <p>0:58:05 Michael: They're all me.</p>
                        <p>0:58:06 Peter: Across the board, it's Michael.</p>
                        <p>0:58:06 Rhiannon: Yeah. The ice cubes are Michael...</p>
                        <p>0:58:08 Michael: Yeah. Rhiannon is a teetotaler.</p>
                        <p>0:58:10 Rhiannon: Yeah. The absolute sober perfection is Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>0:58:15 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>0:58:15 Rhiannon: 'Cause I don't drink, but I mean, sometimes I'm drinking Gatorade or something out of a straw. It's not sober, what I am. [laughter] But...</p>
                        <p>0:58:27 Michael: Rhiannon has her own ways of getting in the mood.</p>
                        <p>0:58:32 Peter: Rhiannon is blowing lines all during recording. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:58:36 Michael: If you hear sniffing.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:58:39 Peter: Yeah, and I mix it up. Sometimes I'll have a beer, sometimes a cocktail. During the summer, I've been known to have an albariño, an increasingly popular Spanish white wine varietal known for its bitterness and hint of peach, its minerality. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>0:59:00 Michael: I am the ice cube guy, mainly because my drinks of choice are usually either Buffalo Trace on the rocks or tequila on the rocks. A nice tequila, usually Casamigos but maybe Chamucos if I'm feeling especially fancy.</p>
                        <p>0:59:13 Rhiannon: Doo-doo-doo.</p>
                        <p>0:59:14 Michael: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>0:59:22 Peter: Next episode, special Electoral College explainer. Specifically, how does it work and why is it about to be directly responsible for fascism in this country for the next half-century?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>

                        <p>00:03 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Amy Coney Barrett, who was nominated this past weekend to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>00:17 Amy Coney Barrett: I fully understand that this is a momentous decision for a President, and if the Senate does me the honor of confirming me, I pledge to discharge the responsibilities of this job to the very best of my ability. I love the United States, and I love the United States' Constitution.</p>
                        <p>00:39 Peter: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks. Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have rained down hell fire upon us like God unto Sodom, leaving nothing but ashes where our hopes once were.</p>
                        <p>01:01 Rhiannon: You listening, Amy?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:07 Peter: Hi, I'm Peter. I'm here with Rhiannon...</p>
                        <p>01:08 Rhiannon: Hey.</p>
                        <p>01:09 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:10 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:12 Peter: And today we are doing a special episode on Trump's shiny new nominee to the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett. And it's probably a good time to mention we had some regular cases scheduled for October and late September, but we're gonna abandon that and sort of just do an election-based Supreme Court extravaganza, so...</p>
                        <p>01:35 Michael: Yeah, buckle up.</p>
                        <p>01:37 Peter: We're doing Amy today. We're gonna do some gerrymandering, some campaign finance, stuff like the Electoral College, and really explain to you why this is all happening, so you can really fully comprehend it right before it happens and your life ends on November 3rd.</p>
                        <p>01:56 Rhiannon: Stay tuned. You're welcome.</p>
                        <p>02:00 Michael: I do wanna say to our listeners, don't hurt yourselves.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:08 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:09 Michael: This stuff can be bleak, and it's more bleak than ever, but just like...</p>
                        <p>02:12 Peter: Oh, no.</p>
                        <p>02:13 Michael: The fight goes on.</p>
                        <p>02:14 Peter: Yeah, and the podcast gets better, the worse things go.</p>
                        <p>02:19 Michael: So don't deprive yourself of the fucking gold 5-4 content that's coming your way.</p>
                        <p>02:25 Rhiannon: Right. That's right.</p>
                        <p>02:25 Peter: So Trump over the weekend, officially nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, and that left everyone asking the same question which is like, what's this fucking lady's deal? You know, what's going on with her?</p>
                        <p>02:39 Rhiannon: Yeah. What's up with her?</p>
                        <p>02:40 Peter: So we're here to talk a little bit about her past, about her politics and religion, about her jurisprudence and what to expect in the fight for her confirmation.</p>
                        <p>02:52 Rhiannon: Let's do it.</p>
                        <p>02:54 Peter: Just a little 30,000 foot overview of Amy Coney Barrett, currently a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which is the federal appeals circuit that covers Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. And she's only been there since Trump appointed her there in 2017. She is almost without question, one of the more conservative members of the federal judiciary.</p>
                        <p>03:15 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:17 Peter: So... Let's walk it back a little bit. Talk about how she got here.</p>
                        <p>03:20 Rhiannon: Yeah. And you know, I just wanna highlight something that Peter already has said, and I think we need to keep in mind when we're learning anything about Coney Barrett, she has been on the federal bench as a judge since 2017, that is... If you're not a lawyer and can do math, three years, you guys.</p>
                        <p>03:41 Michael: If you considered our progenitor podcast. It's about as long as we have been podcasting.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:48 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:48 Rhiannon: That's right. Okay, so Coney Barrett was born in 1972. A little bit more math required here, but that's pretty recent. Her dad was an attorney for Shell Oil.</p>
                        <p>04:01 Peter: Okay. Well, there has been some reporting. And her parents confirmed that as a child, she would often appear behind them in bathroom mirrors only to disappear when they turned around.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:16 Rhiannon: Yeah. So she graduated from Rhodes College in 1994, and she went straight to Notre Dame for law school, where she graduated first in her class. Amy Coney Barrett can read a book. She clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman on the prestigious DC Circuit for a couple of years, and Silberman himself is a bit of a right-wing freak, part of the Nixon administration and Reagan's campaign in 1980.</p>
                        <p>04:49 Peter: Yeah. And you may remember him from just a few months ago when he wrote a barely coherent typo-ridden email to all court staff in which he called the removal of Confederate monuments, the "desecration of Confederate graves" and said, "My great-great-grandfather never owned slaves as best I can tell."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:16 Rhiannon: Awesome.</p>
                        <p>05:16 Michael: Thanks. Good email.</p>
                        <p>05:19 Peter: That's how I end all my emails as well.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, so moving on, Amy Coney Barrett then clerked after she clerked for Silberman for Justice Scalia himself on...</p>
                        <p>05:32 Michael: My favorite.</p>
                        <p>05:34 Rhiannon: That's right on the Supreme Court. She clerked for him for a year from 1998 to '99, and then she went into private practice for a little bit, but pretty quickly thereafter, she doesn't spend a lot of time in private practice, she entered academia, she was a law professor at George Washington for a couple of years before returning to her law school alma mater, Notre Dame, where she taught until Trump put her on the federal bench, like we said, in 2017.</p>
                        <p>06:03 Rhiannon: Oh, and real quick note, those few years she was in private practice, that was like '99, 2000, that year. If that sounds familiar, that is the year of Bush v. Gore, which in private practice, she worked on, I believe, for Jeb Bush, not the Bush campaign...</p>
                        <p>06:21 Rhiannon: Well, well, well.</p>
                        <p>06:22 Michael: But defending him in court, so just a little historical color about Judge Coney Barrett.</p>
                        <p>06:29 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>06:30 Peter: Well, I'm sure that doesn't forebode anything at all.</p>
                        <p>06:34 Michael: Yeah, no. No omen there.</p>
                        <p>06:35 Rhiannon: That's not relevant, Michael.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:38 Peter: So we reviewed some of the scholarship she published while she was a professor, and to me, there's one clear take away, and it's that Amy Coney Barrett thinks about the law like we do, right, she understands that the law is about power and ideology. It's just that her ideology is far right religious zealotry.</p>
                        <p>06:58 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>07:00 Peter: So in 2013, she published a law review article titled Precedent and Jurisprudential Disagreement, where the thesis is essentially that the idea that the Court should be bound by its prior precedent is incorrect. This is something we've talked about, the idea that precedent is essentially an artificial constraint on the Court, that is not particularly useful or consistently applied. So in this broad conceptual way, we agree with her, but what she really means when she says this is like she does not feel the Court should be bound by the liberal wins of the '50s and '60s and early '70s, right.</p>
                        <p>07:29 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly.</p>
                        <p>07:30 Peter: In the article, she specifically uses Roe v. Wade as an example of why relying on precedent too heavily can be a mistake. She essentially says that the public reaction to Roe was so strong that it shows a public rejection of the idea that the Court should be forced to adhere to precedent in the future. And in case that's all a bit abstract for you, the same year she described Roe as "creating through judicial fiat a framework for abortions on demand." So...</p>
                        <p>08:00 Rhiannon: Amy, what?</p>
                        <p>08:02 Peter: She's on record saying that, one, we do not need to respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade and two, she personally strongly disagrees with the decision.</p>
                        <p>08:09 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:10 Peter: So yeah, I think you can see where this is going.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:14 Rhiannon: Right, right. Exactly, and there's this long-standing tradition with conservative Supreme Court nominees where they're asked about whether they agree with Roe v. Wade, and they do this little dance where they imply that while they don't really agree with it, they're going to respect the precedent. So for example, in 2016, during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, Brett Kavanaugh said, "As a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade," but this is also a guy who in his jurisprudence right before his confirmation hearings, he was using that same abortions on demand language to talk about cases upholding Roe v. Wade and protecting the abortion right, so this is...</p>
                        <p>09:01 Peter: They love saying abortions on demand, by the way, like when else would you get an abortion other than when you want it?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:09 Peter: They make it seem like that's the worst option when... The alternative is abortions out of nowhere, like just left-field abortions.</p>
                        <p>09:16 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>09:17 Peter: So yeah, look, this is a new era to some degree, like Amy Coney Barrett is not a John Roberts conservative who really aggressively pretends to adhere to an objective interpretation of the law and claims her role is to call balls and strikes, at least that's not what she's held herself out to be as an academic.</p>
                        <p>09:35 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>09:36 Peter: She's an ideologue, right, and she and every Republican Senator and the Executive Branch are all engaged in an open play to seize power, and so I think this is the first time where there's an actual chance we might see the nominee outright say she disagrees with Roe v. Wade.</p>
                        <p>09:53 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:53 Peter: I don't think it's super likely, but I think it's more likely than it's ever been, we're certainly getting to that point.</p>
                        <p>10:00 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:00 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:00 Peter: And the question of what happens with Roe is an interesting one. In the '80s, people thought the conservative Court was going to overturn it, but an alliance of moderate conservatives, Souter, Kennedy, O'Connor, they sort of held it together. And since then, rather than overturn it, the conservative strategy has been death by a thousand cuts, right? Just weaken the right until it barely exists in practice.</p>
                        <p>10:22 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>10:24 Peter: So that strategy has been very successful, so much that a lot of people are unsure as to whether the conservatives would actually overturn Roe. As it stands, they have abortion rights so weak that many states have just a couple of clinics. Plus, they get the benefit of having single issue voters who just want Roe overturned, right, showing out to the polls. But at some point those voters want action, right. At some point you have to pay the piper. And is that the term... What's a piper?</p>
                        <p>10:48 Michael: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:49 Rhiannon: I don't fucking know.</p>
                        <p>10:50 Peter: Okay, I just said it... It just came out and I was like, is that...</p>
                        <p>10:55 Michael: Piper... That plays a, I think, a flute.</p>
                        <p>10:56 Rhiannon: And you gotta pay them, they can't work for free.</p>
                        <p>10:57 Peter: You can't just have them play the pipe and just sit there watching, you eventually... You have to...</p>
                        <p>11:02 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's fucking rude.</p>
                        <p>11:04 Peter: Right. I get it. The conservative base doesn't want like a functional victory, right, they want total victory. They want symbolic victory. They want it all, right. And I think that Coney Barrett will give it to them.</p>
                        <p>11:17 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:17 Michael: Right. What I do think might happen is you might end up with weird sort of political alliances here where there's plurality opinions with Roberts and Gorsuch and Kagan and Breyer or something, like narrowing the right with Kavanaugh, Barrett, Alito concurring in judgment and saying they would overturn it entirely if they had their druthers, but they don't quite have their votes for that yet. Something like that, where you essentially have liberal signing on to the very extreme erosion of it in order to stave off the straight elimination of it or something. I don't know, I see something like that. Brave new world.</p>
                        <p>12:01 Peter: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>12:02 Rhiannon: Yeah. No, totally. And you know what I'm thinking, what I kind of think might be plausible in the confirmation hearings is you know how they use... Democrats, especially this time around, are going to be using Roe v. Wade as a litmus test, and I think Amy Coney Barrett, she might actually be the first person to be like, no, I think Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. And I fully expect Senate Democrats to be like, oh, like almost like turn to the cameras like, did you hear that? But yeah, that's the point, girl, the Republicans are not going to think that's as big a deal, and I don't think Democrats have done a good enough job at setting up the public to be like, wait a second, that's a huge red flag.</p>
                        <p>12:44 Michael: I mean, in terms of effective litmus tests for weakening Republican base support for this nominee, Roe v. Wade isn't gonna be it, right. Maybe the Affordable Care Act and this case that's bubbling up right now, where they might kill guaranteed issue and to let insurance companies deny you coverage for pre-existing conditions again. That's something that could shake the base, that's something that they haven't been able to get rid of legislatively because their own voters like it too much.</p>
                        <p>13:17 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>13:20 Peter: Yeah. So obviously, Roe v. Wade is on everyone's mind, but her impact on the Court is gonna be much bigger than abortion rights, so we should talk about her record on the bench so far. Like we said, she's only been there a few years, so not a huge amount to look at, but I think there's enough that you can see some pretty clear trends.</p>
                        <p>13:35 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>13:36 Peter: Probably the single biggest trend is something we've talked about before, her continued deference to the Executive Branch. Modern conservatives have taken the position that the Executive Branch should have effectively unfettered discretion in enforcing, for example, immigration laws, and what that means on the ground is that the Court doesn't act as a check on ICE and other anti-immigration efforts, but then also on military issues, on environmental issues, on countless other issues within the Executive Branch's general prerogative. Coney Barrett has in several cases taken the stance that executive discretion is in those areas near absolute.</p>
                        <p>14:12 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:12 Peter: So a case from earlier this year, Cook County v. Wolf, the Seventh Circuit halted a Trump administration policy that instituted a wealth test for green card carriers, and Coney Barrett filed a 40-page dissent, arguing that the Executive Branch had broad authority to regulate immigration. Similar case, Yafai v. Pompeo, Barrett upheld the denial of a visa to an American citizen's Yemeni wife. The interesting thing here is that she questioned whether courts are even allowed to inquire into whether the Executive Branch is acting in good faith, and this is something we've talked about before too, because it's increasingly common that the Trump administration is just flatly lying to the Court about their motivations for various policies, the most famous example being the Muslim ban, which we talked about in our Trump v. Hawaii episode.</p>
                        <p>15:02 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:05 Peter: Because the Trump administration is so frequently lying to courts and because its actual motivations are often plainly illegal, the administration's allies on the Court have steadily coalesced around the idea that it's like, it's just not their job to look at the administration's motives here, and Barrett appears to be a champion of this idea, and obviously that's very convenient for our big dumb racist President.</p>
                        <p>15:28 Rhiannon: Exactly. Yeah, and the Affordable Care Act is also on the chopping block. There's the decision out of the Fifth Circuit, a terrible one with a lot of complicated issues. Amy Coney Barrett is also a staunch gun rights supporter. She wrote a lengthy dissent in one case stating that she didn't believe non-violent felons could be prevented from having guns, but in the same dissent, she specifically mentioned that voting rights were not protected in the same way.</p>
                        <p>15:56 Peter: And I think that brings us to a pretty important point. Coney Barrett does not believe in any meaningful right to vote in this country, and will absolutely be complicit in whatever heist the Republicans are about to pull on the democratic institutions of this country. Like we've said many times before, the conservative project in this country relies on voter suppression. There is no question about where she stands on this.</p>
                        <p>16:19 Michael: Right, right. And this episode is about Coney Barrett, and I wanna stay focused on her, but we're talking about her because she's Donald Trump's nominee. And the fact that he's nominating her in this context at this time, it has implications, 'cause he doesn't really have a re-election strategy. What Donald Trump has is a political strategy to retain power despite losing the election, that's what he's doing. He says it, we know this because he's open about it, he knows mail-in voting could hurt him, so they are attacking mail-in voting, they're sending 50,000 goons to swing states on election day to intimidate black and brown voters at the polls, they're going to challenge bad results in court after the election, which we know 'cause he's told us that, right? And he wants to install a friendly Justice in case those court challenges make it up to the Supreme Court, which they've openly said.</p>
                        <p>17:12 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:12 Michael: This isn't subtle. He doesn't disguises intentions, there aren't secret plans within plans, right, it's happening out in the open, this plan to subvert American democracy and Coney Barrett is a big part of it. She's the friendly Justice, and it's the single biggest consideration for him in who to choose the nominee. Will they be a friendly vote when his ability to retain power is on the line?</p>
                        <p>17:37 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>17:38 Michael: So she's aware of that. There's no way she's not. And even if she somehow was, like he definitely fucking brought it up to her. Right, this is the guy who asked James Comey for a loyalty oath. This is the guy who doesn't try to seduce women, he grabs them by the pussy.</p>
                        <p>17:55 Rhiannon: Yep. That's our President.</p>
                        <p>17:57 Michael: Yeah. This guy sat her down, and was like, look when push comes to shove, are you my fucking Justice?</p>
                        <p>18:03 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>18:03 Michael: And it doesn't really matter how she answered, whether she was coy about it or she straight up told him, because he left confident enough to nominate her, that's the important thing here to understand is she is a part of this, right. Maybe Biden wins big enough that they can't steal it and this never gets put to the test, but you should always remember, no matter what some sort of fucking loser tries to tell you that she's a brilliant jurist or she's very fair-minded or a good person. No, she's not. She fucking sold out our country and willingly signed on to this plan to subvert our democracy so she could get a Supreme Court seat. That's who she fucking is.</p>
                        <p>18:42 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>18:43 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>18:47 Peter: Yeah. Okay, so yeah, we're a little bit into this episode, and I think it's time to talk about the weird religious shit that this lady is up to.</p>
                        <p>18:54 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>18:55 Peter: One of the biggest discussion points of Coney Barrett's nomination, and something we mentioned last week, is her involvement with a religious group called People of Praise.</p>
                        <p>19:04 Rhiannon: Yeah, this group is super, super far right. They believe that husbands are the head of the household, and they assign people advisors. Peter, I think you mentioned in our last episode, that until recently, the People of Praise called these advisors, the advisors for women, they called them handmaids. And that terminology, by the way, it was disposed of fairly shortly after the New York Times wrote about it, so obviously it's safe to say all they're doing is covering their asses.</p>
                        <p>19:38 Peter: They're nominally Catholic, right? They're...</p>
                        <p>19:41 Michael: They're nominally ecumenical.</p>
                        <p>19:41 Peter: Oh, sorry, yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:44 Michael: So they're basically Catholic. The vast majority of their membership is Catholic.</p>
                        <p>19:48 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>19:48 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:49 Michael: And according to Reuters, the group shares a preference for charismatic worship, which can involve speaking in tongues.</p>
                        <p>19:57 Peter: Nice.</p>
                        <p>19:58 Rhiannon: Love that.</p>
                        <p>19:58 Peter: Yeah, I like that they wanna stay Catholic, but just start adding in all the most insane things from American Protestantism.</p>
                        <p>20:05 Rhiannon: Right, let's do Catholicism, but at the circus.</p>
                        <p>20:09 Peter: Yeah. We love the top-down institutionalized pedophilia of the church, but we'd love to throw in some river baptisms if we could. Can we get that?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:19 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>20:21 Peter: So look, the bottom line on this stuff is very simple, she is a religious zealot, she will be asked about whether her religion will influence her rulings and she will say no, and that will, for all intents and purposes, be a lie. Of course, she is influenced by her religion. If you think that someone can have a religion that shapes every single aspect of their life to the point where they are like pledging loyalty to a religious group, but then not let it influence how they view the law, you're delusional, you are a sucker.</p>
                        <p>20:49 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>20:50 Peter: Coney Barrett wrote articles in the late '90s about how devout Catholic judges could not enforce the death penalty and should recuse themselves from those cases, with a footnote that cited to similar articles about abortion. So even though in the case of the death penalty, I'd agree with her, she has openly argued that religion should influence judges.</p>
                        <p>21:08 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:09 Rhiannon: Maybe the one thing that's more important to her is the conservative political project, so she has said before that, for example, even though she doesn't religiously agree with the death penalty, she helped Justice Scalia when she was a clerk...</p>
                        <p>21:25 Peter: Kill a man.</p>
                        <p>21:27 Rhiannon: Right. She helped Justice Scalia kill a man by execution by writing opinions that argued that somebody should get the death penalty.</p>
                        <p>21:32 Peter: I love that I was just making a joke there, and then because you're a defense lawyer, you were like, exactly.</p>
                        <p>21:38 Michael: Peter was talking about them doing the most dangerous game. She wrote an article saying that Catholic judges should recuse themselves from death penalty cases, but then when her confirmation was up was like, I'll do my duty as a jurist, right, as a judge.</p>
                        <p>21:53 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:54 Peter: Yeah, so there's a quote being thrown around from a 2006 speech she gave, a commencement speech, where she said, "our legal career is but a means to an end, and that end is building the Kingdom of God." That would seem to indicate that she understands the law as being part of a religious mission. USA Today wrote an entire article claiming that this quote is taken out of context. I was pretty fascinated by how that could possibly be true, given how that quote reads.</p>
                        <p>22:21 Michael: It's a pretty blunt quote.</p>
                        <p>22:22 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>22:22 Michael: It sorta speaks for itself.</p>
                        <p>22:24 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>22:25 Peter: Yeah, so she was giving a commencement speech at Notre Dame Law, so USA Today argues that it's taken out of context because she wasn't really talking about the separation of church and state, she was just giving students advice, but that's not what taken out of context means.</p>
                        <p>22:38 Michael: Right. My advice is, go forth and do God's will in your career as jurists.</p>
                        <p>22:44 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:45 Peter: Right. The entire point is that she's framing the practice of law as a means to an end, and that end is the fulfillment of their religious virtues.</p>
                        <p>22:53 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>22:54 Peter: That's the context. Fucking USA Today.</p>
                        <p>22:55 Rhiannon: The context is she's talking about the law, and she's talking about people in the future who will work in the law, and she says, do God's will.</p>
                        <p>23:02 Peter: Also, imagine you're at the Notre Dame law commencement, and it was just like the highest ranked school you could get into so you're stuck there and this fucking insane woman is like, "You will do God's work." And you're like, "Jesus Christ."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:19 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>23:20 Peter: Okay, so I wanna talk briefly about the contours of this discourse, because the primary reaction on the right to criticism of her belonging to this pseudo-cult is that it's anti-Catholic discrimination, and that will be the narrative you hear from the GOP on this. Not in small part because they need to win over Catholic voters in Pennsylvania and the Midwest, and I won't even get into the fact that every fucking American Protestant thinks that Catholicism is like a demon cult.</p>
                        <p>23:48 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>23:48 Peter: And the Pope is literally the antichrist, whatever. This shit is simple. If your religion influences how you interpret the law, it's fair game, and I'm well past my teenage atheist phase, but I do find it a little frustrating how we're not allowed to talk about how bizarre these people are. Sorry, but the people who are in some little cult where you swear a loyalty oath and have advisors called handmaidens... freaks, freaks, right?</p>
                        <p>24:12 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:14 Peter: I don't care how smart you are, I don't care how high your IQ is, if you get caught up in this stuff and build your life around it for decades on end, sorry, but your brain is not doing great, like something's wrong with it, and if these people didn't come from fucking high society money, they'd be getting Waco'd by the ATF, but instead, for some reason they are feeding into our country's most powerful institutions. It's fucking absurd.</p>
                        <p>24:38 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:41 Michael: Right. And like the idea that this shit is off-limits is so ridiculous, because every other political office, religion is an issue.</p>
                        <p>24:48 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>24:50 Michael: Candidates for President, Senate, House, whatever, they regularly get asked about their religious beliefs at debates for public scrutiny all the time.</p>
                        <p>24:57 Rhiannon: Sure. Yeah. Right.</p>
                        <p>24:57 Peter: Right. You gotta kiss Jesus on the cheek to fucking get any public office in this country.</p>
                        <p>25:04 Michael: Right. And separately, one of the points we make on this podcast all the time is that things like textualism or originalism or purposivism or whatever don't actually matter, that when push comes to shove, those are no obstacles for conservative judges enacting conservative policy goals. Nor are they obstacles for liberal judges to enact liberal policy goals, like you can construct an originalist argument for pretty much whatever you want. But those things are of course in bounds, right, these are the okay things to be interrogating about. Amy Coney Barrett, what's her preferred method of statutory interpretation and what's her approach to interpreting the Constitution?</p>
                        <p>25:44 Michael: It's such bullshit. So we're supposed to look into this stuff that doesn't matter, but we're supposed to ignore the actual world view and beliefs that shape how she will decide these cases.</p>
                        <p>25:57 Rhiannon: The stuff that she's explicitly saying matters to her in doing her job.</p>
                        <p>26:02 Michael: I'm not saying she shouldn't be a judge or a justice because she's Catholic. I'm saying that if her Catholicism shapes her beliefs, then that's worth interrogating what those beliefs are and how that will impact her judgment.</p>
                        <p>26:16 Peter: Yeah. Also worth noting, though, Catholics have had a majority on the Supreme Court for 30 years. I don't really know what this is, but for some reason, there is some sect of Catholics that are just geared towards legal academia and dominate it, just they are filling the top ranks of our courts in a way that is wildly disproportionate. The idea that the Supreme Court is discriminating against Catholics is absurd. It's majority Catholic right now.</p>
                        <p>26:45 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:45 Rhiannon: Yeah. Who else is Catholic, Peter?</p>
                        <p>26:47 Peter: Roberts is Catholic, Thomas is Catholic. Alito is Catholic, Sotomayor is Catholic, Gorsuch, Episcopalian raised Catholic, so he probably just couldn't find a church nearby or something and just went... Found an Episcopalian, and Kavanaugh is Catholic. The fact that the Court is majority Catholic should be plenty of evidence that there is not some like system of discrimination that is operating to exclude Catholics here.</p>
                        <p>27:11 Michael: People who are opposed to her nomination want a devout Catholic Joe Biden to nominate someone in her stead.</p>
                        <p>27:20 Rhiannon: Right, right. There you go. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:22 Michael: Come on! But look, like you bring this up, the idea that the way her Catholicism might like shape her view of the law should be fair game, you literally get called a bigot and not just by the right. This was happening from liberal law professors within the last week of recording this. Some professor in North Carolina, I think, said that people who wanna bring up her Catholicism need to take a look in the mirror and think about when you decided that religious discrimination is okay.</p>
                        <p>27:49 Peter: Dipshit.</p>
                        <p>27:50 Michael: First of all, Professor Hessick, and I mean this with all my heart, eat shit. And more generally speaking, this is just another example of how refusal to accept that judging is political, that judges wield political power and shape policy, and in fact, liberal participation in hiding that fact just serves as an obstacle to gaining power ourselves.</p>
                        <p>28:14 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:14 Michael: And given who the opposition is, that means it leaves us unequipped to oppose literal fascists.</p>
                        <p>28:21 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:21 Michael: And you know what, if this makes me a bigot, so be it, but if Amy Coney Barrett is gonna be deciding my rights for the next 30 years, I think it's fair for me to ask whether she's ever spoken in tongues.</p>
                        <p>28:34 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>28:36 Michael: I think I have the right to know.</p>
                        <p>28:36 Rhiannon: That's absolutely right. If a fascist leader says, God wants me to do fascism, it is not religious discrimination for me to question those religious beliefs and how they play into this fascist leader's political views.</p>
                        <p>28:51 Peter: And fucking brace yourselves for the Republicans' indignance about all of this, it's gonna be absolutely fucking insufferable. They would nominate David Koresh if he was still alive, but they can't.</p>
                        <p>29:05 Michael: Guys, I need to get some ice for my drink, so if we could just pause for an ad, I'd appreciate it.</p>
                        <p>29:12 Rhiannon: Roll that ad.</p>
                        <p>29:13 Peter: So one thing that might have popped out when we read Coney Barrett's biography out to you is, why her. She's got an impressive track record, sure, but it's not that impressive by Supreme Court nominee standards. Notre Dame would, I think, make her the only non-Ivy League, non-Harvard, Yale Justice on the Court. She had some prestigious clerkships and was a professor for 15 years, but there are plenty of young conservative judges out there. So you might have asked why was she the clear front runner? And the answer to that is fairly simple. In 2017, during her confirmation hearings for her appointment to the Court of Appeals, Dianne Feinstein asked some aggressive questions that seemed to attack Coney Barrett's religion directly. She famously said, "the dogma lives loudly within you," which I'm sure that she thought was a very powerful line, but it backfired.</p>
                        <p>30:05 Peter: She was trying to portray Barrett as being too heavily influenced by her religion, but it came across as sort of casting aspersions against religion itself. As a result, the right rallied around Coney Barrett and she became like a bit of a hero in their circles. Just like with Brett Kavanaugh, there's nothing they love more than this completely manufactured martyrdom.</p>
                        <p>30:26 Rhiannon: Exactly, that's their favorite kind of ammo.</p>
                        <p>30:28 Peter: If they perceive the left to be attacking someone, they rally around them by default, it doesn't matter what you fucking did. So there are 50 more qualified judges getting passed over because American conservatism consists almost entirely of a politics of completely imagined grievance. Like, are they being mean to her? Guess what, we're gonna make her a fucking Supreme Court Justice, that is literally the thought process of the Republican Party.</p>
                        <p>30:53 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>30:53 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>30:54 Peter: And I guess maybe that brings us to what the confirmation process actually is and what you can expect in the coming weeks. Michael, I'll leave this to you, 'cause you're the smart one.</p>
                        <p>31:07 Michael: Well, in brief, there really isn't any set way for the nomination process to go. Under the Constitution, the Senate has to give advice and consent, but it can do that however it wants, and so they could just take it to a straight vote, if they want to. The way it's been done traditionally has been that the Senate Judiciary Committee takes care of pretty much everything. They do a background investigation, which includes getting a lot, a lot of documents, financial records, work stuff, whatever, closed door hearings with the nominee. While this is ongoing, the nominee will then have one-on-one meetings with Senators, both in the Judiciary Committee and outside of the Judiciary Committee. I think Sotomayor met with 80 or 90 Senators one-on-one. And then there will be like public hearings before the Judiciary Committee, which can be tame, like Gorsuch, or they can be more like Kavanaugh's, right, and then the Committee votes to send the nominee forward or not.</p>
                        <p>32:03 Rhiannon: And when you say send them forward, you mean to the whole Senate...</p>
                        <p>32:06 Michael: To the full Senate.</p>
                        <p>32:07 Rhiannon: For a final vote.</p>
                        <p>32:08 Michael: And so if that goes along party lines, it will be like 11 to 9 Republican in favor and the nominee will go forward, and then within a few days, the full Senate will vote.</p>
                        <p>32:21 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:22 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:23 Michael: That's it. That process usually takes like six to eight weeks, which is not enough time. In this case, I think if they wanna get it done before the election... To hear a case about the election, you wouldn't have to get it done before the election, but maybe they just wanna have it in their back pocket. So they're gonna have to rush it.</p>
                        <p>32:37 Rhiannon: Yeah, and in fact, it'll be the shortest timeline for confirming a Supreme Court nominee kind of in the modern era. And I just wanna break down a little bit like what that expedited timeline means for the confirmation process. Outside of Coney Barrett as a jurist, this confirmation process kind of like Kavanaugh's will be about breaking norms, and I think we should be looking out for during her confirmation the extent to which norms are broken. The timeline to get Coney Barrett confirmed before the election is one way that norms are being broken to the conservative advantage, but then a whole bunch of norm-breaking kind of flows from that too. What typically happens during the confirmation process for a Supreme Court nominee is that a nominee fills out this really lengthy questionnaire, it's sort of a comprehensive background investigation into who the nominee is as a person and as a judge, and these documents, the final kind of completed questionnaire, this ends up being hundreds and hundreds of pages long, you can look up Brett Kavanaugh's on the Judiciary website.</p>
                        <p>33:43 Rhiannon: The hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, in many aspects, they sort of flow out of that questionnaire. Staffers comb through the answers that the nominee provides, they do fact-checking, they craft questions for the Senators to ask during the hearing, so it's so much work that typically there is a 28-day minimum period between receipt of the completed questionnaire responses and any hearing, but with Republicans saying that they want Coney Barrett confirmed before the election, there's no way that that happens here.</p>
                        <p>34:15 Rhiannon: Michael mentioned a background investigation, it's literally the FBI. The FBI typically does their own fully detailed look into a nominee's background.</p>
                        <p>34:24 Peter: Yeah. They have to put all of their assassinations of civil rights leaders on hold.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:31 Rhiannon: And they privately share those confidential findings, but they share them with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and that's just not going to happen here in the Amy Coney Barrett case, because it's not going to happen qualitatively or on the scale that it usually would if there's this crazy condensed timeline, it's just not possible. And the last thing I wanna say about the confirmation process and how norms will be broken is just a word about the preparedness of Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. News came out last week that Senators, not just staffers, but Senators themselves were raising red flags about the competence of Dianne Feinstein to lead Democrats in the Judiciary Committee during this confirmation process.</p>
                        <p>35:15 Rhiannon: Twelve Senators have anonymously sounded this alarm, and while they're anonymous, this is a big deal. Dianne Feinstein is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And the people working for her and with her do not think she is fit for the job or equipped to lead in the way that she needs to in this moment. And just like having that distrust in leadership means that the party then goes into the confirmation hearings, which are already chaotic, and particularly so in this case because of the timeline crunch, but they're going into that without as unified and strong a front as they could, if everyone was on the same page.</p>
                        <p>35:52 Peter: Although we should add, though, that there aren't any real procedural mechanisms for the Democrats to stop this. This is all about whether or not they could put on a strong enough case that the Republicans would have to be like, oh, shit. Is this worth it? Do we need someone else, etcetera. It's gonna be tough to do, like Amy Coney Barrett's record's gonna be squeaky fucking clean.</p>
                        <p>36:12 Michael: Like if Kavanaugh didn't do it, then, like...</p>
                        <p>36:14 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:14 Peter: Right, exactly. But this is interesting because in large part, Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, those confirmation hearings that were about allegations of wrong-doing, this one's gonna be about ideology, like Robert Bork was in the late '80s.</p>
                        <p>36:28 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>36:30 Peter: The Republicans folded with Bork, they won't fucking fold here. They are ready to fight.</p>
                        <p>36:35 Michael: Can I give a contrarian position on that Feinstein article?</p>
                        <p>36:40 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:40 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>36:41 Michael: The article talks about the confirmation hearing and her fitness for that, but it also talks about replacing her as head of Judiciary next term, especially if Democrats take the majority. And I read this whole thing as, in part, a response to her talking about opposing filibuster reform, opposing court reform. Chuck Schumer's talking about this stuff like leadership is behind it, and Feinstein, all of a sudden saying she's gonna be an obstacle to that, and then within 48 hours, there's a brutal hit piece calling her senile. I think that's a good sign that Democrats are like, fuck this, if you're not on board, we're gonna drag you through the mud and replace you and get people who are with the fucking program.</p>
                        <p>37:24 Peter: That's a good point.</p>
                        <p>37:24 Michael: To do what needs to be done.</p>
                        <p>37:26 Rhiannon: No, no, I agree, and I think distrust in Dianne Feinstein as an obstacle to sort of progressive gains in Congress and that kind of thing, that's a good thing, but specifically in terms of going into this confirmation hearing, I think it's really...</p>
                        <p>37:40 Peter: Prepare to watch an incredibly senile woman with a barely functioning brain go up against a very, very smart person in her prime. It is gonna be...</p>
                        <p>37:52 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. And just to finish the point, the members of the party who are trying to oppose this nomination or at least call into question a nominee's record, a nominee's ideology, they typically work together to present cohesive thematic lines of questioning and arguments that build on one another, and they build a narrative that the public can follow, right. Dianne Feinstein is flat out not able to lead the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee in a way that unifies and strengthens that presentation, and if you don't think that's a big deal, and this is just how it's always done, and Dianne Feinstein earned that position or whatever the fuck, then ask yourself why Republicans made Lindsey Graham the chairman of the Judiciary Committee over Chuck Grassley, right. Lindsey Graham knows how to play for TV viewers, he knows how to ask a question, he knows how to craft a narrative.</p>
                        <p>38:40 Michael: Damn right. 100% on point.</p>
                        <p>38:43 Peter: Yeah, so finally, we should talk a little bit about some of the press Coney Barrett has gotten. There's been plenty of skeptical and critical media coverage, but alongside it, I've seen a trend that we've seen before, with Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, ostensible liberals writing about how actually she won't be that bad.</p>
                        <p>39:00 Peter: The first is a Bloomberg piece from Noah Feldman who clerked at the Supreme Court alongside Coney Barrett, and that's important, because every time you see an op-ed like this, it will be from one of their personal friends...</p>
                        <p>39:13 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>39:14 Peter: Without fail.</p>
                        <p>39:16 Rhiannon: Right, yes.</p>
                        <p>39:17 Peter: The piece is titled "Amy Coney Barrett Deserves to be on the Supreme Court." Already mad. Literally, no one deserves to be on the Supreme Court, but whatever. The gist of his piece is nothing more than one, Amy Coney Barrett was nice to me, and two, she's really smart, so she should be on the Court. That's it, right?</p>
                        <p>39:32 Michael: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>39:33 Rhiannon: Cool.</p>
                        <p>39:33 Peter: The most telling line to me is when he says, "I know her to be a brilliant and conscientious lawyer who will analyze and decide cases in good faith, applying the jurisprudential principles to which she is committed," which leads to a fairly obvious question in my mind, what are those principles, dude?</p>
                        <p>39:48 Rhiannon: Exactly. I have questions about the principles, motherfucker.</p>
                        <p>39:52 Michael: That's my objection.</p>
                        <p>39:54 Peter: That's the speaking in tongues part or whatever her handmaiden tells her? [chuckle] Just being committed to principles and sticking to them isn't like a good thing, like wow, that guy is really committed to his principles. That's not always good. Frequently bad. Yes, I agree that she's committed to her principles, and those principles are steeped in batshit crazy reactionary ideology.</p>
                        <p>40:13 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>40:14 Peter: He ends his piece with, "I'm going to be confident that Barrett is going to be a good Justice, maybe even a great one, even if I disagree with her all the way." Like Jesus...</p>
                        <p>40:24 Rhiannon: God...</p>
                        <p>40:24 Peter: What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
                        <p>40:24 Rhiannon: Dammit, dude.</p>
                        <p>40:25 Peter: Like Jesus Christ, we talk about this sort of thing all the time, but I'm gonna lose my fucking mind, like, reading this. These people view the law as completely detached from human existence, such that he can disagree with everything she does and still thinks she's doing a good job. What does that even mean? You could never say that about any other profession in the world, like, "Oh, I think he'll be a great basketball player, although I do not believe that he is competent at playing basketball in any specific way."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>40:55 Peter: If you think that everything someone is saying is wrong, but you still think they're doing a good job, you need to take a step back and contemplate what the fuck you think the law even is.</p>
                        <p>41:04 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>41:05 Rhiannon: Right, the person who can say something like that is a person who lives a life that law never touches them, right? Law doesn't hurt you, law doesn't have the power to ruin your life, to hurt the people that you love, and so that's the kind of person who can say something as absolutely inane and disconnected as "I disagree with a judge on literally every issue, but she's a good judge."</p>
                        <p>41:27 Peter: Right, yeah, I don't know much about Noah Feldman, but he's writing this from some fucking town house, right? Go fuck yourself, dude.</p>
                        <p>41:34 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly.</p>
                        <p>41:35 Peter: Like that's the bottom line. To these people like this is all intellectual games, they're rich and comfortable, and the outcomes of these cases have no material impact on their lives unless they are about fucking shareholder value.</p>
                        <p>41:46 Michael: I was gonna say, which is why I said on Twitter that you should make this op-ed impact his material life, Harvard law students. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>41:54 Rhiannon: Yeah, right.</p>
                        <p>41:56 Michael: Make him think twice next time he wants to go publicly to bat for a fascist. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>42:02 Peter: Yeah, like this guy just thinks that the Court is like a place for a spirited debate. In 2029, he's gonna be reading a decision where the Court upholds the concentration camps in Central Ohio, and he's gonna be like, "Well, this logic is impeccable, great work, Amy." [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>42:17 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>42:19 Peter: The other piece that jumped out and it's a Washington Post piece from again, one of Coney Barrett's colleagues at Notre Dame, O Carter Snead, is that a real name? What's the O stand for, bro? I bet it's embarrassing. He doesn't like it. The piece is titled, "I've Known Amy Coney Barrett for 15 Years. Liberals Have Nothing to Fear."</p>
                        <p>42:40 Rhiannon: Michael. Michael, teeing up.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>42:46 Michael: We've looked into O Carter Snead. You might think from that headline that this is another in the genre of liberals going to bat for conservatives, but no, it turns out he clerked for a conservative judge, he worked for George W. Bush as general counsel to his Bioethics Committee or something, where he focused on abortion issues. As a bioethics expert, he spends a fair amount of time and energy engaging in pro-life advocacy, legal work, coming up with clever arguments as to why abortion should not be legal. He wrote an article in 2016 saying that it's a dubious proposition that the Constitution protects a right to abortion.</p>
                        <p>43:29 Peter: Right. Yeah, that's the guy telling you not to worry, go fuck yourself, you disingenuous piece of shit. We were talking about this yesterday. It's not like don't worry. It's like, shh, shh, shh, it'll all be over soon.</p>
                        <p>43:41 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>43:42 Michael: Yes, exactly.</p>
                        <p>43:43 Rhiannon: Right, right, right.</p>
                        <p>43:44 Michael: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>43:44 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>43:45 Michael: This fucking dead-eyed piece of shit.</p>
                        <p>43:48 Peter: We're gonna find out in 10 years if this is not a real person.</p>
                        <p>43:50 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:51 Rhiannon: Right?</p>
                        <p>43:52 Michael: It looks like that is like bots that generate fake images. Yes, that's exactly right.</p>
                        <p>43:56 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:57 Michael: But look, it's not an editorial offered in good faith. This is some asshole taking a victory lap, he's frigging smugly telling us, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit," while oiling up a fucking four-foot metal rod he's gonna shove up our ass.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>44:15 Michael: That's what this editorial is, and so if you subscribe to The Washington Post, I want you to reconsider that, like seriously? If you're listening to this podcast, I assume you're angry and distraught about this, and you should just think about what type of person thinks this is what you need to be reading right now, like how much disdain they have for you. In the meantime, I'm gonna get one of my college buddies to pitch the Washington Post on an op-ed titled, I've Known Michael for 20 Years, and O Carter Snead Has Nothing to Fear, about how I'm absolutely not going to travel to Indiana and beat the living shit out of him.</p>
                        <p>44:52 Peter: Yeah, I will vouch for Michael. He is not going to beat O Carter Snead within an inch of his life.</p>
                        <p>44:57 Rhiannon: I personally have known Michael for a long time. I've never seen him beat someone's ass and put them in the ER, you know?</p>
                        <p>45:04 Michael: So sleep easy, O Carter. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>45:09 Peter: Oh, yeah, so look, there are gonna be people like this who try to convince you that she's a reasonable person or that she's smart, we should wait and see how she rules, and that'll be a fun little thought experiment for people who care about the minutiae of statutory interpretation, but for everyone else, we know what's coming. Reproductive rights are in peril, healthcare is in peril, voting rights are in peril, LGBT rights are in peril, workers' rights, immigrants' rights, all in danger, unless and until the Democrats engage in systemic reform of the Court.</p>
                        <p>45:39 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>45:39 Peter: This isn't about Amy Coney Barrett. If it wasn't her, it would be someone else and we would have an episode about how all of their beliefs are exactly like hers, whatever, they would be in a different cult. This is about a political party that is fairly openly engaged in a transition to outright fascism and its desire to seize power over American courts to aid that transition. The Federalist Society is an ideological organization that is designed from the bottom up to ensure that conservatives have control over the judiciary, over legal academia in this country, that they have undue, unearned influence. And she's part of that, that's why you have someone who rises from just being a professor at a second tier law school to all of a sudden, bang, Supreme Court within four years. We want you to know who this woman is, yes, but she is not unique, the rot is deep and systemic. Yes.</p>
                        <p>46:34 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>46:35 Peter: Yes, Amy Coney Barrett is a demon from hell, but hell is full of demons, and they're all in the fucking Federalist Society. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>46:45 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>46:45 Rhiannon: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>46:46 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>46:54 Peter: Alright, next week is a listener Q&A episode. All of these events have given our listeners a bunch of questions and we will be answering them with 100% accuracy, [chuckle] a lot of questions about the elections, about court reform, just about the law generally, law school, etcetera. A lot of should I go to law school? Which I can answer right now, if you'd like me to.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>47:18 Peter: And then we will be commencing our month-long election extravaganza, starting with the Electoral College.</p>
                        <p>47:27 Rhiannon: Yay!</p>
                        <p>47:27 Michael: Yay! [chuckle]</p>

                        <p>00:09 Peter: Welcome to an emergency broadcast of 5-4. [chuckle] We are in hell. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>00:21 Rhiannon: It's bad, guys, it's bad.</p>
                        <p>00:24 Peter: Today we are discussing the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the political chaos that is currently consuming us all. This is probably the most hopeless I've felt since Trump got elected, where you were just like, "Okay, here we go."</p>
                        <p>00:48 Michael: But I feel even less...</p>
                        <p>00:51 Peter: Objectively, there is less hope because Trump also was elected. Right?</p>
                        <p>00:54 Michael: Yes, right.</p>
                        <p>00:55 Rhiannon: Right, right, right. We're already in that context of a shit storm.</p>
                        <p>01:01 Michael: How I'm feeling is I've been up for about an hour, I haven't eaten anything and I am drinking a very large glass of... This is mostly tequila [laughter] with a little bit of Kahlua, a little bit of coffee and a little bit of soy milk. That's my breakfast, don't worry, I have a second waiting in the wings. [laughter] That's where I'm at emotionally.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Rhiannon: Right. I'm on the West Coast which means it's even earlier for me right now in the morning, and yeah, everything hurts, that's all.</p>
                        <p>01:39 Peter: So we want to talk a little bit about RBG's body of work, and a little bit more about the implications of her death and her failure to retire when she could have been replaced by a Barack Obama appointee. And I think we should give just a little bit of historical color here. So, in 2009, shortly after Barack Obama was inaugurated, the liberal Supreme Court Justice David Souter retired from the Court. In 2010, several months before the midterm elections, liberal Justice John Paul Stevens stepped down from his position on the Court. In 2018, shortly before that year's midterm elections, conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy did the same thing. And each of these Justices was doing something fairly obvious, they were choosing to retire when their political party had control of both the Presidency and the Senate, ensuring that their successor would be an ideological ally of theirs.</p>
                        <p>02:46 Peter: But in 2013 or so, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg was 80 years old and the Democrats controlled both the Senate and the Presidency, she chose to remain on the bench and publicly stated that she intended to do the job until she couldn't anymore. At the time, she was a two-time cancer survivor, having been diagnosed with colon cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009, and on September 18, 2020 at the age of 87, that pancreatic cancer killed her. And now, her spot on the Court will almost certainly go to a far right wing psycho appointed by Donald Trump.</p>
                        <p>03:27 Peter: Ruth Bader Ginsburg did a huge amount of good in her life, she was a trailblazer in her field, she is as close to single-handedly responsible for building up gender discrimination laws to where they are, as any one person could be, her jurisprudence on the Court was very strong, certainly one of the maybe most liberal two or three Justices of all time. But her decision to stay on the Court was devastating to the perseverance of left and liberal values in American politics and policy. That decision will likely eventually erode whatever legacy she has impressed upon American law, and it is the consequence of someone who, for whatever reason, failed to understand that the power she wielded should come with some affirmative obligation to the people that she wielded it over.</p>
                        <p>04:22 Rhiannon: Yeah. When I look back, obviously when all of us are looking back on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life, it's a life of superlatives, right? Everyone I'm sure who is listening to this, has heard or read already various obituaries and news segments that are memorializing her life and legacy over the course of the past couple of days since she died, and so we don't want to spend too much time here with the sort of end-of-life tributes when I think other people are doing that much better than we can. But I do think...</p>
                        <p>04:53 Michael: Or want to.</p>
                        <p>04:54 Rhiannon: [chuckle] Right. But I do think that, nevertheless, a conversation about the end of her life and where we're left without RBG is incomplete if we don't at least go through some highlights of the amazing contributions that she did make. So just to start off, she was one of less than 10 women in a class of 500 men at Harvard Law, the first woman to be on two major law reviews after she transferred to Columbia Law School and joined the Law Review there. She was a mother in law school, I think that she had her first child the year before she went to law school, and while she was in law school her husband, Marty Ginsburg, was also in law school at the same time and she cared for him when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Now, in all of that, and she still graduated at the top of her class. So these are the accomplishments of an undeniably intelligent person, and that was before she even did anything in the law, before she even started her career. And then we get to her career. As a lawyer, she argued in front of the Supreme Court multiple times, she crafted the arguments, like Peter said, that became the basis for sex discrimination laws in this country.</p>
                        <p>06:03 Peter: Right. To give some color there, she struggled to find work in New York, just by being first in her class out of Columbia, but she landed a job with the ACLU, which is where she made her mark.</p>
                        <p>06:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. And she did, she made that mark using really a shrewd legal mind on cases in which she was insisting that laws that held women back were also damaging to men. She's well known for quoting the abolitionist, Sarah Grimké, in front of the Supreme Court. She said, quote, "I ask no favor for my sex, all I ask of my brethren is that they take their feet off our necks." And at the end of her oral argument for the last case that she argued in front of the Supreme Court, so before she was a Justice, a case in which she was challenging a law that made jury duty voluntary for women but not men, then Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked her, "So, you won't settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the dollar then?"</p>
                        <p>07:00 Rhiannon: She would, of course, later be William Rehnquist's colleague when she became the Supreme Court Justice, and she famously would say years later that she would be happy only when there were nine women on the Court. So look, all that to say like Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an icon. She inspired generations of attorneys, she paved the way for women in this profession, and look, a woman or man, you can't point to a more successful and influential and powerful lawyer, she's up there with a tiny handful of people.</p>
                        <p>07:29 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>07:30 Rhiannon: So turning to her legacy, I'm feeling confused right now about why criticizing the choices that Ginsberg made towards the end of her life takes away from any of those accomplishments. We keep hearing that we need to give props, and I guess I don't understand how criticism of a very public choice that she made takes away from those accomplishments, I'm not dismantling sex discrimination law. So what does giving credit for the accomplishments do for us without the necessary criticism? Who does it serve if we don't talk about a grave mistake that she made. And by the same token, we don't do this criticism because it's fun for us to say bad stuff about a sweet old lady, it's because maybe if we're talking about these aspects of her public service, the areas in which she failed, maybe we can fucking learn from history for once. RBG, undeniably a big part of the reason women have sex discrimination laws they can rely on in this country, a big part of the reason why we have any abortion right to speak of anymore, she's a monumental figure, and she died in the most precarious and alarming political context possible, and that was by her own design.</p>
                        <p>08:44 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>08:44 Rhiannon: And so if you want people to say that you are perfect when you die, you should let that go, 'cause no one's perfect. If you would like people to say that you served the public righteously and justly till the very end, then do that and that will be your legacy. Ruth didn't do that. So her legacy is tainted. And so I just think we need to unpack what bothers us so much about saying that. She held an immense responsibility because she lived a life where her job was public service, and in the end, she made a decision that didn't serve us well.</p>
                        <p>09:17 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>09:17 Rhiannon: She was a titan, she was a hero to many, and among her many incredible accomplishments, there was a big mistake. And I just want to emphasize that that failure doesn't mean that we despair forever. When we criticize someone, it doesn't mean like my point or my politics is about nihilism and nothing will ever be good, what's the fucking point? It's a criticism of choices, it's a recognition that where we are is the result of political and personal choices, particularly by those in power, and when we criticize, it's because there's a better way. People could have done different things and things would be better now, so actually, I think that's like a recognition about possibility and potential.</p>
                        <p>09:54 Michael: Absolutely. There's a very predictable response to what Rhiannon just said, and it's predictable because we've seen the response a number of times, and it's something like, "How could you have known?" or conversely, "What about fucking Merrick Garland? He's not on the Court. What about Mitch McConnell?" And so I just want to lay out a few things that are just facts. Yes, two Justices, liberal Justices retired in 2009, 2010 when the Democrats had 60 or 59 Senators after Scott Brown's election and the Presidency. They lost seats in 2010 in the Senate. Barack Obama won re-election in 2012, but they lost more seats in the Senate in 2012. They lost control of the House in 2010, and did not have control of the House after 2012. It was very obvious in 2013 that their hold in the Senate was precarious. They had lost seats in two straight elections, they had just lost control of another House of Congress in the last few years. Everybody knew Republicans could gain control of the Senate in any of the coming elections. And that Barack Obama was in his last term because he's term limited. As a result, there was very public pressure on her to retire.</p>
                        <p>11:17 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:18 Michael: There were articles written about it, people asked her about it. She publicly commented on it. This was predictable at a point in time when she could have retired and a Democrat could have replaced her. That's just a fact. It is a historical fact.</p>
                        <p>11:34 Rhiannon: Yeah, and it's predictable... What I think is really important, it's predictable in sort of both aspects, the system and the political majority was about to be lost.</p>
                        <p>11:44 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>11:44 Rhiannon: And everybody could tell that that was happening. And then also personally, she was 80 years old in 2013. Like Peter said, she had had cancer twice. What is...</p>
                        <p>11:54 Peter: Colon and pancreatic cancer. Those are like two of the worst.</p>
                        <p>11:58 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's awful, right?</p>
                        <p>12:00 Peter: I don't even know how she's like... She survived like 11 years of the pancreatic cancer at that age, which man, it must be nice to be rich.</p>
                        <p>12:05 Rhiannon: Yeah. [laughter] Great healthcare.</p>
                        <p>12:06 Peter: If I get pancreatic cancer, I'm gone in like six months.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:09 Peter: The doctor's like, "Just... Yeah, just walk into a beautiful field and enjoy the rest of your days."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:16 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>12:17 Michael: So when I say this was predictable, I mean, the current moment where she's being replaced by a Republican President with some right-wing goon. Obviously, Barack Obama wouldn't be President forever, obviously Democrats wouldn't hold the House forever. But even beyond that, our institutions are on the brink right now, like this... Sorry. [laughter] It's hard not to sound melodramatic when you talk about this stuff, but this might be the last free election in the country.</p>
                        <p>12:53 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>12:53 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>12:54 Michael: I don't think that's an exaggeration. I think we are very clearly down like a path that a country like Turkey is on, and we're like a decade behind them and they are... It's a fucking joke. And that was predictable. And like, look, I think if you are upper-middle class or middle class or working class or whatever, and you work 50 hours a week and you're just trying to pay your rent and make your mortgage, I don't think it's incumbent on you to read Marx or Rawls or Dworkin or whatever, and keep up with every in and out of the ongoings of the legislature and the state Republican parties and all that shit. But do you know who that is fucking incumbent on? The most powerful people in the country who happen to be political activists like the Supreme Court Justices.</p>
                        <p>13:44 Michael: And do you know who is very well-positioned to see the direction of the country, are the Justices who were in dissent on Citizens United, talking about how this opened up our elections to purchase by corporations. It's Justices who were in dissent on Crawford v. Marion County, talking about how the Republican Party was disenfranchising voters on the basis of made-up laws that don't exist and voter ID laws. It's the Justice who was in dissent... Who wrote a powerful dissent in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013, of all years, about how the Republican Supreme Court Justices were gutting the Voting Rights Act and setting back our democracy decades.</p>
                        <p>14:26 Michael: There is nobody better positioned in this country to understand the risk that our democratic institutions faced at the time. The direction Republicans were going, gerrymandering was already ongoing, those cases were already in the courts, people were already talking about it eventually coming up to the Supreme Court. This was on their fucking radar and they were talking about it publicly in their decisions. And she still, understanding that, was like, "I'm gonna risk it. This is what's on the line, but I am so fucking important."</p>
                        <p>15:00 Peter: Yeah, and that is what she thought. This was being sort of debated on Twitter and such over the weekend, the extent to which this is just an ego thing. And she made comments that basically implied that she didn't feel like she was readily replaceable. There wasn't the talent to replace her, that is ego. And bullshit, absolute bullshit. There is no one in this country...</p>
                        <p>15:21 Michael: That is insanely insulting to Kagan and Sotomayor, I'm sorry. Deeply insulting. She's looking at the two people that the current President had just... At that time, the current President had nominated in the last few years and being like, "They don't measure up to me."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:35 Peter: And just objectively, you could program a robot to get the right decisions in these fucking cases 98% of the time.</p>
                        <p>15:43 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>15:43 Michael: I was gonna say they agree with her over 90% of the time.</p>
                        <p>15:46 Rhiannon: Right, right, right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>15:48 Peter: And the same thing is true of dozens of lower court federal judges.</p>
                        <p>15:51 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly.</p>
                        <p>15:53 Peter: One thing I want to mention is there's this common refrain that, "This isn't really RBG's fault, this is a systemic issue." We shouldn't have a system that is reliant on whether or not a cancer-ridden, 87-year-old lives or dies. And that's true to a degree, but it is also the responsibility of people in her position to mitigate that problem by retiring when they are younger and when it is politically reasonable to do so. That's why so many Justices do it, that's why most Supreme Court Justices in the past 20 years have stepped down rather than died on the Court. I would never argue that this isn't a systemic problem, of course it is, of course it's bigger than RBG, but everything she needed to know to mitigate that problem, she knew in 2013 and 2014, and she didn't take advantage of it, she didn't do anything with it. She let her ego and her desire to remain on the Court for whatever reason carry the day. And now, Trump is poised to replace her with someone who will erase her legacy on the Supreme Court, erase.</p>
                        <p>17:02 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>17:03 Peter: Every fucking thing that we managed to scrape out of the Supreme Court in the past 30 years, and there isn't much, because it's been a conservative-dominated institution, but everything we have managed to scrape out of the Court is at risk.</p>
                        <p>17:17 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>17:18 Peter: Whatever tattered remains of abortion rights are there, God knows what they're gonna do on abortion, but it's not gonna be good, it's gonna be a fucking nightmare. Voting rights, already extremely tenuous, now basically doomed, it's endless. Another big thing is the Executive Branch discretion, the extent to which the Court is just deferring to the Executive Branch on what it wants to do, whether it be militarily, anti-terrorism efforts, anti-immigration efforts...</p>
                        <p>17:48 Rhiannon: Environmental efforts.</p>
                        <p>17:50 Peter: Right, environmental issues, you're going to see a functionally unchecked Executive Branch.</p>
                        <p>17:56 Michael: And if you think it's bad in Trump's first term, just imagine it in his third and fourth term.</p>
                        <p>18:01 Peter: Yeah, and the corollary is you will see a much more restrained congressional branch because conservatives don't believe that Congress should have that much power. They believe that the Executive Branch has also its discretion and that Congress doesn't.</p>
                        <p>18:12 Michael: I saw somebody say that the Supreme Court was basically becoming the legislative branch and Congress was becoming a reality TV show. And that's maybe an exaggeration...</p>
                        <p>18:21 Rhiannon: That's good.</p>
                        <p>18:22 Michael: But the dynamic is pretty spot on.</p>
                        <p>18:24 Peter: That sounds right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>18:26 Michael: Republicans are outsourcing all their unpopular policy goals to the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>18:33 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, and I want to make a point, I'm glad, Peter, that you brought up the systemic issues. We do not approach the death of RBG from a criticize this-person-only perspective. We criticize this system on the podcast every single episode. And it's a problem and we are constantly criticizing the problem of our system that results in two Presidents who lost the popular vote having appointed five out of nine Supreme Court Justices. That's a problem that our system can spit out that result for us.</p>
                        <p>19:09 Michael: Really quick, confirmed by Senators who collectively won fewer votes than they'll vote Senators.</p>
                        <p>19:15 Rhiannon: Yes. Extremely important, right, right. And so we're calling that out all the time, and so I don't want to seem like this is "only Ruth fucked up and it would be perfect otherwise." But that's not our point at all. And I feel really compelled to respond to those who are saying that criticism of RBG purely comes out of sexism, that it's because she's a woman and that male justices wouldn't be getting the same criticism at the end of their lives or whatever. I just want to say personally, I actually have learned a lot about a public accounting of a Supreme Court Justice's life and career from John Paul Stevens, from Thurgood Marshall, from Justice Blackmun, from Justices who were on the Court for a long time, and then at the end of their careers looked back and publicly talked about mistakes that they made, challenges that they faced.</p>
                        <p>20:10 Rhiannon: To me, it's more dehumanizing and it's more sexist to say, "She was a lady Supreme Court Justice, she was a bad bitch, she was HBIC, and so let her rest in peace." Rather than say, "No, the titans of our legal world, the powerful people who took part in shaping these decisions and making these calls for all of us, we hold their feet to the fire even at the end of their careers," and they do it too, because they recognize that their careers were part of this process and part of a political reality for all of us.</p>
                        <p>20:48 Michael: Yeah, and that she had a lot to offer post-retirement.</p>
                        <p>20:51 Rhiannon: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>20:52 Michael: And that we are robbed of, right?</p>
                        <p>20:54 Rhiannon: Yup.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Michael: That we do not get now. I mean, maybe she has papers, Felix Frankfurter has all these papers that we can read and we can... And he took copious notes and you can read about the decision-making process from judicial conferences and stuff, and that's awesome, but... And for the most part, it relies on Justices in their retirement phase talking and writing and reflecting and we're robbed that. And the other thing I want to say to Rhiannon's point is also, fuck you, Stephen Breyer, fuck you too. And Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, obviously. And it's awful in general, it's awful on her level, on a personal level, because she was a wonderful icon and an important trailblazer, and everything we've said, and it's awful on a national and global level because of its implications, for literally the state of the world, and Stephen Breyer isn't dead, he's alive and kicking it on the Court, good for him. But he also should have retired in 2013 and 2014, he wasn't quite as old...</p>
                        <p>22:00 Peter: Yeah, he's about five years younger.</p>
                        <p>22:01 Rhiannon: Than Ruth.</p>
                        <p>22:01 Michael: And he didn't really have cancer twice, you can kind of see the calculation on his part, in him saying, "Well, I'm not as similarly situated." But you know what? Fuck you too, you're 75, it's time to like... At the time, right?</p>
                        <p>22:15 Rhiannon: Right, right. Back then.</p>
                        <p>22:16 Peter: If you're over 70 and there's a situation where you're basically nearing in on a potential six years of not having the Presidency or Senate, which is I think what you're looking at in 2013-2014, yeah, the correct thing to do is to retire.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Michael: You just gotta fucking go.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Michael: You gotta go gracefully, that's it.</p>
                        <p>22:32 Peter: And I've heard people point out that it's sort of sexist that people talk about RBG's decision much more than Breyer's, I think there's probably something to that, but I also think like, A, yes, he was five years younger and didn't have cancer, but also there's no cult of personality around Breyer, he doesn't have a fan club. He's incredibly mediocre.</p>
                        <p>22:50 Rhiannon: Right, right. He doesn't have a rap nickname.</p>
                        <p>22:52 Peter: Right. And if you're us, you take the harsher position on RBG in large part because there doesn't seem to be an adequate public accounting of her failure, I don't think that's as likely to exist for Breyer, I guess we'll see when he dies. But part of the reason we sort of reflexively say, "Wait, she fucked up," and have to make an episode about how badly she fucked up, is because it's just not being discussed enough, at least in the legal academia, legal journalist circles that control the narrative on stuff like this.</p>
                        <p>23:21 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>23:22 Michael: Yeah, a prominent law professor, Josh Chafetz, has been tweeting about it and getting a lot of heat for it. And fucking keep speaking truth to power, man. It's awesome. The other thing I want to say is Breyer owns responsibility for his decision not to retire, which was fucking stupid and selfish.</p>
                        <p>23:42 Rhiannon: He's publicly said he should have or?</p>
                        <p>23:44 Michael: No, I'm just saying in my perspective, Breyer owns responsibility for that.</p>
                        <p>23:48 Rhiannon: Oh, okay. Right.</p>
                        <p>23:49 Michael: Ginsburg owns responsibility for her stupid and selfish decision not to retire, but I think Breyer owns a little responsibility for Ginsburg's as well, I think there's a dynamic there where it's understandable if you're Ruth Bader Ginsburg to be like, "Look, Stephen Breyer's fucking 75, and people aren't calling for him to step down." And there were, there were a few.</p>
                        <p>24:11 Rhiannon: There were, yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:11 Michael: But it wasn't nearly as loud, it wasn't nearly as prominent.</p>
                        <p>24:14 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>24:14 Michael: And I can be like, "Well, fuck you, if he's staying, I'm staying." Like that, I get that. I don't think it's right, I think it's very self-involved, but I get it. And maybe her position would be a lot more tenuous in 2013 and 2014 if Breyer had done what was obviously necessary and correct and stepped down. So fuck you too, dude, I blame you as well. Jesus Christ! Fuck these people.</p>
                        <p>24:41 Peter: So I guess we should talk about what happens next. There are more knowledgeable people than us when it comes to the sort of prognosticating about Senate procedures and shit like that, but I think in broad terms, the next steps are fairly clear. Mitch McConnell has two options, one is to ram through a nominee before the election, and there's some risk that comes with that, right? There are bunch of close Senate races, and people might not like him ramming it through, and it might harm the Republicans in those races. I will say that I'm a little bit skeptical that they would care about that, mostly because they suffered zero electoral consequences from the Neil Gorsuch-Merrick Garland debacle, might be a little different this close to the election.</p>
                        <p>25:25 Peter: The other option is for them to wait out the election and risk having to ram through an appointment in a lame duck session if Biden wins. That sort of takes away the election risk, but then you definitely look a little bit slimier on the back end. Again, I don't know that they care about that either, so either way, all of the downsides are things that would matter much more to someone with shame, and they don't have that. So yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:49 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly.</p>
                        <p>25:50 Michael: Right. I think the biggest disincentive for them right now is a credible threat to completely restructure the Supreme Court should Democrats gain power, right?</p>
                        <p>26:02 Rhiannon: Yeah, so in that lame duck session potentially, if Biden won the election, Biden could be threatening credibly, say, to pack the Court or do other things that would pressure the Senate.</p>
                        <p>26:15 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:16 Peter: When we say pack the Court, we mean expand its size via legislation, which is what it requires, it doesn't require a Constitutional amendment, just add four seats to the Supreme Court and Biden nominates, and the Democratic controlled Senate confirms all those four and all of a sudden there are 7 out of 13 Justices rather than 3 out of 9, who are appointed by Democrats and we have a majority. So that's the credible threat. Look, if you fucking do this, we're just gonna nuke the thing and rebuild it in a way that's not so profoundly unfair.</p>
                        <p>26:47 Michael: Yeah, which is why Republicans have to be really careful not to let everyone vote in this election.</p>
                        <p>26:52 Peter: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>26:53 Rhiannon: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>26:55 Michael: That's right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:56 Peter: We live in hell. Okay. So the question of who replaces Ginsburg is, it's tough to answer, but there does appear to be a clear frontrunner, and that is Amy Coney Barrett.</p>
                        <p>27:09 Rhiannon: Boo! Huge fucking boo!</p>
                        <p>27:11 Peter: She is a Court of Appeals judge on the Seventh Circuit, appointed to that position by Trump. She is 48-years-old, former...</p>
                        <p>27:17 Rhiannon: Ay-ay-ay.</p>
                        <p>27:18 Peter: Scalia clerk, a full-fledged fucking psycho. She's got those Michele Bachmann eyes. You guys, you know about that?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>27:25 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:26 Peter: Her eyes at rest are like mine if someone jumped out of my closet at 3:00 AM.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>27:36 Rhiannon: There's a dead person inside of Amy Coney Barrett and it's scaring her very much.</p>
                        <p>27:41 Peter: That's right. Yeah, there's gonna be a Karen on the Court. I think that's the best way to put it.</p>
                        <p>27:45 Rhiannon: Yes, that's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>27:46 Michael: Yes. Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>27:48 Rhiannon: A superlative first Karen on the Court.</p>
                        <p>27:50 Michael: Isn't she like a trad Karen, she's like a hardcore Catholic Karen.</p>
                        <p>27:54 Peter: So first of all, a huge darling of the Federalist Society. The reason that she's considered the frontrunner in large part, like yes, there's her age. There's the fact that she's a woman. But also a couple years ago, people wanted her appointed to the Court, and Trump reportedly said that he was saving her for the Ginsburg seat.</p>
                        <p>28:12 Michael: Which again, if you didn't think this was predictable, fucking eat shit. Obviously, even dumbass barely sentient Donald Trump...</p>
                        <p>28:19 Rhiannon: Yeah, he gets it.</p>
                        <p>28:20 Michael: Was like, "Yeah. She's probably not gonna make it through my term. I am definitely gonna get to replace her."</p>
                        <p>28:26 Rhiannon: "I got a girl lined up to replace the dumb old girl that's there right now."</p>
                        <p>28:32 Peter: So yeah, in 2017, the New York Times reported that Coney Barrett belongs to a Catholic-adjacent group that calls itself People of Praise, which has its members swear a lifetime loyalty oath to the group. It assigns each member a same-sex advisor, which until recently were for the women in the group called hand maidens. So...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:54 Michael: Oh, fuck!</p>
                        <p>28:54 Peter: Get ready. Get fucking ready.</p>
                        <p>28:58 Rhiannon: I have no comment, really.</p>
                        <p>29:00 Peter: But she's gonna be the first person to ask for the Senate Judiciary Committee's manager during the appointment process, during the nomination process.</p>
                        <p>29:08 Michael: If there is a nomination process. There's actually already been calls in some little disturbed corners of right-wing Twitter, which is basically the mainstream of conservative policy...</p>
                        <p>29:17 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>29:19 Peter: Yeah, are you referring to the White House Press account?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>29:21 Michael: That, like the Kavanaugh nomination process was so contentious that they should just skip all that and go straight to a vote. Trump should nominate someone, and they should just vote on it.</p>
                        <p>29:35 Peter: Okay, can we talk about what is easily the funniest right-wing reaction two years out from Kavanaugh? Which is like, "Look, they're just gonna accuse everyone of rape, so let's preliminarily just say we're not going to play that game." They believe that the Kavanaugh thing was just left-field like, "No, they're just making up rape accusations, and they're gonna do it again like this." It's like the most...</p>
                        <p>29:57 Michael: It's like a new playbook that we didn't even think of.</p>
                        <p>30:00 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly.</p>
                        <p>30:00 Michael: Before Gorsuch. Right. Or we would have definitely accused Gorsuch of rape, and there's no way that the accusations against Kavanaugh, like fucking villain in every '80s movie about college. Like the biggest college douche in every movie you've ever seen.</p>
                        <p>30:21 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>30:21 Michael: That the accusations that he raped someone would be like unfounded.</p>
                        <p>30:24 Rhiannon: No, that's left-wing radical strategy.</p>
                        <p>30:26 Peter: They also believe that it was like proven false, like that.</p>
                        <p>30:30 Rhiannon: God!</p>
                        <p>30:30 Peter: I don't understand where exactly that comes from, but that's definitely their position.</p>
                        <p>30:34 Rhiannon: Yeah, so those are the issues with a Kavanaugh-type nominee. The issues with a Coney Barrett-type nominee is that she would be calling 911 during confirmation hearings to report difficult questions.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:49 Michael: Calling on...</p>
                        <p>30:49 Rhiannon: These people are attacking me.</p>
                        <p>30:51 Michael: Kamala Harris.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:51 Peter: Calling on Kamala Harris for asking aggressive questions on the Judiciary.</p>
                        <p>30:55 Peter: There's a black woman talking very aggressively to me.</p>
                        <p>31:00 Michael: I feel very threatened!</p>
                        <p>31:00 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>31:01 Peter: Oh, my God!</p>
                        <p>31:02 Michael: The smart money's on Coney Barrett. Everybody says it. There's this report of Trump. But like I said this on Twitter and I want to say it here, that I don't think we should rule out Justin Walker. I think there are very good reasons that he's a dark horse.</p>
                        <p>31:17 Rhiannon: Tell us about him, Michael.</p>
                        <p>31:18 Michael: He's even younger than Coney Barrett. He's like in his 30s still, right? Or is he 40?</p>
                        <p>31:23 Peter: No, he's 14-years-old.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>31:27 Michael: But this guy, he's made the news many times. Once because the American Bar Association was like, "This guy is just not qualified...</p>
                        <p>31:35 Peter: To be a federal judge?</p>
                        <p>31:36 Michael: At all to be a district judge, 'cause he's never heard a case," and it's like a joke. Within a year, he was, or maybe within 18 months or whatever, he's now up for the Circuit Court of Appeals. I think he actually just got confirmed for that in the last few months, so he moved up very quickly. We've talked about him on the podcast before for writing an absolutely insane opinion striking down some basic pandemic regulations that limited the ability for churches to have meetings on Sunday. That sounded like he was saying essentially that like, "God thinks churches should meet. [chuckle] And who the fuck is this Governor for thinking otherwise?"</p>
                        <p>32:22 Rhiannon: Exactly. If you don't know this guy, it's okay. Everybody actually knows him. Think back to seventh grade when there were rumors that one of the very disturbed children in your class spent the weekend trying to light his cat on fire. That's Justin, Justin Walker, yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:40 Michael: Yeah. The reason why I think we can't rule him out, is because we seem to live in a world where the worst possible scenario happens reliably, and I think he is the worst possible scenario. But also, there are a lot of other reasons, like for one, he was a Mitch McConnell aide, and Mitch McConnell loves him, and he's clearly been on McConnell's fast track. If Ginsburg didn't die and Trump won a second term, he was the next, like after a few years on the circuit court. McConnell loves him. Liberals hate him, which is a fucking...</p>
                        <p>33:12 Peter: That's their mandate, yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:14 Michael: End in itself for the conservatives. Yeah, right? It would drive people nuts.</p>
                        <p>33:16 Rhiannon: Absolutely. That's a win for them.</p>
                        <p>33:18 Michael: There are very good sort of... Like resentment, retributive, on that angle, it just makes so...</p>
                        <p>33:26 Rhiannon: Vindictive, yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:27 Michael: Vindictive, that's the word, yes.</p>
                        <p>33:29 Michael: Okay, I actually think you're wrong about this, about what the most vindictive thing is, and here's why. I don't know that it'll be Coney Barrett, but I think that it will be a woman because Republicans love to play that sort of identity politics gotcha, right?</p>
                        <p>33:43 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:43 Peter: And so they did this with Thurgood Marshall's seat...</p>
                        <p>33:45 Michael: That's true, that's true.</p>
                        <p>33:46 Peter: First black Supreme Court Justice, famously liberal, famously centralized racial relations in his analysis and his experience of discrimination, and the GOP replaced him with Clarence Thomas, which I am positive they thought was hilarious, like...</p>
                        <p>34:02 Rhiannon: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>34:03 Peter: 'Cause they view identity politics purely like checking a box...</p>
                        <p>34:06 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>34:07 Peter: And having no other value. And so they're like, "Look what we're doing, and we can do it too." And...</p>
                        <p>34:11 Michael: That's true. That's a fair point.</p>
                        <p>34:12 Peter: They're gonna appoint a woman who believes that uteruses are the exclusive jurisdiction of state governments, and they're gonna flaunt the fact that she's a female in front of you with the sole purpose of mocking any sincere desire that you have for inclusion and representation.</p>
                        <p>34:29 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:29 Michael: Do we have a fair accounting of Coney Barrett's like voting rights jurisprudence? Because they were gonna have a woman speak at the RNC who literally wanted to eliminate one person, one vote, and felt like household voting was the way to go, which is essentially a way for letting husbands vote for their wives as well, right, well...</p>
                        <p>34:52 Rhiannon: Yikes, I hadn't heard that, Jesus.</p>
                        <p>34:54 Michael: Yeah, she's literally on record being like, "A household should only have one vote." So like, I don't know, Coney Barrett, who knows, but it's not out of the question for the modern Republican Party to weaken the ability of women to vote.</p>
                        <p>35:08 Peter: Yeah, we'll see what her handmaiden advisor tells her to do.</p>
                        <p>35:16 Rhiannon: Oh, God. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:22 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:22 Peter: Oh, God. Things are going down hill really fast.</p>
                        <p>35:22 Michael: I feel like this is a good point for me to say something that has been on my mind for the last 24 hours...</p>
                        <p>35:26 Rhiannon: Tell them.</p>
                        <p>35:27 Michael: Which is like, we talk about this in a 6-3 Court rather than a 5-4 is very scary. Neil Gorsuch being the median vote is very scary, for all the obvious reasons, but this just feels bigger to me than that, it feels bigger even than just like voting rights. This feels like fucking like a flashpoint in history, like the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, you know what I mean?</p>
                        <p>35:51 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:52 Michael: It feels like there're gonna be massive repercussions for this one way or another. Either it's like literally Republicans have such a stranglehold on the Court that maybe they steal this presidential election, give up entirely on democracy, and our country slides very quickly into some sort of authoritarian regime, which obviously as the most powerful military and most powerful country in the world in the history of man, has massive implications, or there's a very remote, but still plausible possibility, that there's enough of a Democratic wave, right? That they can't fucking steal it. And Joe Biden is President, and they take over the Senate, and they grow some fucking balls, and make DC and Puerto Rico a state, and expand the Court, and whatever, blah, blah, blah, and we come back from the brink, right?</p>
                        <p>36:50 Michael: We're not quite yet at the point where this is irreversible, but it's like an increasingly distant possibility. Coming back from this is increasingly difficult, like the necessary conditions for undoing this are like a massive recession like in 2008, which delivered a massive electoral victory and 60 Senate votes, or possibly a pandemic with hundreds of thousands of dead, millions dead across the globe, which could possibly deliver Joe Biden and the Senate to the Democrats, but that's the scope here of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decision not to retire.</p>
                        <p>37:35 Rhiannon: That's the scale, right.</p>
                        <p>37:36 Michael: At the end of the day, to undo this, we're talking about global level disasters. That's the balance, that's fucking it.</p>
                        <p>37:47 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:47 Peter: Remember in the late '90s when we were all worried about asteroids, were you guys worried about an asteroid hitting the Earth in the late '90s?</p>
                        <p>37:54 Rhiannon: I was.</p>
                        <p>37:54 Michael: Yeah, there were two movies in the same year.</p>
                        <p>37:57 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:57 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, I definitely was.</p>
                        <p>37:57 Michael: Right? There was fucking Deep Impact and Armageddon.</p>
                        <p>38:00 Rhiannon: Volcanoes, asteroid, Dante's Peak, bugged me up.</p>
                        <p>38:02 Michael: There were two movies in the same year, yes.</p>
                        <p>38:04 Peter: Yeah, I feel like in retrospect, that's a good way to go, if scientists were like, "This one's coming for us, we've got four days." I'd be like, "Oh, that was close." We almost had to play out history.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>38:19 Michael: You know, in Independence Day the people who were dancing and celebrating under the alien spaceship before it annihilates everyone, like if we knew they were gonna annihilate everyone...</p>
                        <p>38:28 Peter: That's what it would be like now, yeah.</p>
                        <p>38:28 Michael: I'd be out there under the spaceship.</p>
                        <p>38:30 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah.</p>
                        <p>38:31 Peter: "Thank you." Just like a...</p>
                        <p>38:33 Michael: Yay, let's fucking go, let's go. Here comes the end of human civilization, you fucking did it, guys.</p>
                        <p>38:40 Peter: Alright, we should turn back to Ruth. This podcast is generally speaking about the extent to which the Court is influenced by political ideology and the extent to which the practice of law serves to hide that reality.</p>
                        <p>38:55 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>38:55 Peter: Ruth Bader Ginsburg failed to reckon with the fact that the Court is an ideological institution and that the practice and interpretation of law is ideological, and if she understood that, truly, she would have understood the threat posed by someone like Donald Trump being able to name her successor. And if she admitted to herself that this is about ideology, then she would have to admit to herself what these stakes are, and that comes with the understanding that a massive burden rests on her shoulders.</p>
                        <p>39:23 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>39:23 Peter: She never acted like that was true, she made a bunch of public statements where her failure to grasp the stakes was very palpable. In a 2014 Reuters interview, she said that the issue of when she retired was "a question for her own good judgment." That statement just reflects like a complete abdication of the responsibility she had, right?</p>
                        <p>39:42 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>39:42 Peter: The Supreme Court impacts millions of people, she doesn't get to hide from that. She doesn't get to frame it as if it's a personal matter. In the same interview, she was asked about the calls for her to step down and be replaced by Obama, her response was to ask rhetorically who could have been nominated that people would rather see on the Court than her. And putting aside how insanely narcissistic you'd have to be to think that you are literally unmatched across the legal field, the answer would be like any intelligent left liberal legal professional who's not in their 80s would be better.</p>
                        <p>40:15 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>40:15 Peter: Not a hard rhetorical question, you know.</p>
                        <p>40:17 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>40:17 Michael: There's a concept in sports that I feel like is worth mentioning here, which is called value over replacement.</p>
                        <p>40:22 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>40:24 Michael: Which is, it's not just like your raw production. If we could replace you with the average player...</p>
                        <p>40:30 Peter: How much do we lose?</p>
                        <p>40:31 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>40:32 Michael: And what's the difference? Right. And so what's Ruth Bader Ginsburg's value over a replacement player for the last seven years? And it's zero. It's zero. Like anyone who could replace her that Obama would have nominated and a Democratic Senate would have confirmed, would have voted roughly exactly the same.</p>
                        <p>40:51 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>40:51 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>40:52 Michael: There's maybe, maybe five decisions that would have gone differently, and they probably would have gone differently in a way that would make liberals happy and her joining the conservatives. My point is, she risked a lot to gain nothing.</p>
                        <p>41:08 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>41:08 Michael: We've talked a lot about the risk and about the downside risk of like if she dies, well, you know, there's a Republican in power, like the risks of that. But what's the gain? What did we say the gain... The answer is nothing.</p>
                        <p>41:19 Rhiannon: Right, right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>41:21 Michael: That's the answer. I'm sorry, but we have gained...</p>
                        <p>41:23 Peter: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>41:24 Michael: Nothing over a generic liberal judge being in her place for the last seven years.</p>
                        <p>41:29 Rhiannon: Exactly, and I...</p>
                        <p>41:30 Michael: So I'm a little heated.</p>
                        <p>41:32 Rhiannon: I love it, Michael. You talk your shit, king. I think we get here because of a philosophy of sort of foundational politics of indispensability and of individualism. Ruth Bader Ginsburg believed she was the only one who could do that job. And she forgot that it was movements and organizations and colleagues and mentors and strategy that got her to where she was, including the wins that we give her as part of her legal career, right? It wasn't just Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And that's all in addition to her undeniable intelligence and drive and unique abilities as a lawyer. And I think that disconnect sort of becomes the foundation for a politics that puts you in the center rather than the people you got into the career to serve and it's a politics...</p>
                        <p>42:22 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>42:22 Rhiannon: That use your own accomplishments as the end goal of history, as the end goal of fights for justice of legal reform of democracy.</p>
                        <p>42:30 Michael: Fuck, yeah.</p>
                        <p>42:31 Rhiannon: And in the end, that kind of framework means that her failing body was at the center of a really scary political moment, because now the autonomy and the politics of millions of bodies hang in the balance.</p>
                        <p>42:44 Peter: Yeah, absolutely. So let's wrap up, 'cause I've got... For the next seven hours, I've got it calendared it off to be screaming into a pillow.</p>
                        <p>42:51 Rhiannon: That's right. Yeah, yeah, we need to get to that.</p>
                        <p>42:54 Peter: And the response of legal journalists and academics to her death has been sort of predictably targeting the positives of her legacy and largely ignoring or even being outright dismissive of the impact of her choice to stay on the bench on that legacy. Many people have gone a step further and been openly hostile towards the idea that we could or should create criticize Ginsburg right now. So I think one thing that we probably have made clear, but let's just hammer home, there is no cogent and coherent defense of her decision to remain on the bench through 2014. None.</p>
                        <p>43:27 Rhiannon: Period.</p>
                        <p>43:27 Peter: You will not hear one.</p>
                        <p>43:28 Rhiannon: Period.</p>
                        <p>43:29 Peter: This was a seat that could have been filled with a liberal Justice for the next 20 to 30 years, and instead it will belong to a radical conservative for that time because of Ginsburg's decision.</p>
                        <p>43:37 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>43:37 Peter: There's nothing more to it. So to everyone who asks that we show her more respect or deference or just give her her due credit and move on, like I want to ask those people, "What is it you think we should ask of the powerful? What obligations do you believe the most powerful people in the world should have to the rest of us?" You can applaud people who wield power responsibly if you'd like, but people who wield it irresponsibly need to be criticized, right? Power isn't a reward for doing or being good. It's a responsibility.</p>
                        <p>44:07 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>44:07 Peter: It should be a burden. It should be uncomfortable to have. Ginsburg put herself in a position where the question of whether she lived or died weighed heavily on the lives of people in this country. I said this the last time we talked about Ginsburg, more or less. But the most influential people in the world don't get to use their deaths to insulate themselves from scrutiny. It was reported that she said on her deathbed that her "most fervent wish is that her replacement is not appointed until after the inauguration." I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say that I don't think she's dumb enough to believe that anyone in the modern Republican Party, let alone Donald Trump or Mitch McConnell, would ever honor that wish. But it is a bit unfortunate, to say the least, that the first time RBG showed a glimmer of awareness of the significance and precariousness and political import of her position was right before her death. I mean, we maybe could have used that sort of foresight when it might have meant something, Ruth.</p>
                        <p>45:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>45:00 Rhiannon: That's it.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: Thank you gentlemen. The case is submitted. We'll hear arguments next in The city of Los Angeles against Lyons.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:07 Leon: Hey everyone. This is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about LA v. Lyons, a 1983 case about the use of chokeholds by police and whether a person who had been subjected to one can sue to have the tactic barred altogether. The court rejected the case on the basis of standing, one reason chokeholds continue to be used today.</p>
                        <p>00:33 [Archival]: And what you're watching here is officer Daniel Pantaleo putting Garner in a chokehold, and with other offices on him, wrestling him to the ground. Garner died later that day as the medical examiner ruled his death, a homicide.</p>
                        <p>00:47 Leon: This is 5-4. A podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:00 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have cut off America's circulation like Raynaud's disease. [laughter] I am Peter. I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:13 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:15 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:19 Rhiannon: Hi everyone.</p>
                        <p>01:20 Peter: Today's case is City of Los Angeles v. Lyons. This is another case about cops, in addition to our...</p>
                        <p>01:26 Rhiannon: Blurg.</p>
                        <p>01:27 Peter: Long catalog of cop episodes, and specifically it is about their use of chokeholds. It's also about the court evading its responsibility to curtail police violence by denying injunctive or forward-looking relief in cases where the police are using tactics that will unjustly hurt people, most likely, poor people and people of color in the future. And it's about a standard that the court invents in this case that makes it incredibly difficult to get forward-looking remedies in general. In other words, the standard makes it extremely difficult to get courts to tell someone, in this case, the police to stop doing something that will almost certainly harm someone in the future.</p>
                        <p>02:08 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>02:09 Peter: Chokeholds, of course, one of the many, mostly non-lethal methods, cops have at their disposal to subdue criminal suspects and/or their own wives. [laughter] And in this case, a guy gets put into a brutal and excessive chokehold by the LAPD after which he sues, and in his lawsuit, he requests that the practice of chokehold to be halted moving forward. But the court in a five to four decision says "No, we can't stop them from using chokeholds in the future. Because even though they already put you into a chokehold once you can't prove that they'll do it again." The year is 1982. So William Rehnquist is on the court, but he's not yet the Chief Justice. The chief is still our buddy Warren Burger. And you know this case, I think is a case study in how and why justice often lagged so far behind for so many people who are wrong in this country and in how the court has used procedural technicalities to allow police departments in this country to promulgate and utilize brutal and unconstitutional tactics against its citizens.</p>
                        <p>03:21 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:22 Michael: Yep.</p>
                        <p>03:23 Peter: So, Rhi, tell us a story. What happened here?</p>
                        <p>03:26 Rhiannon: Sorry, it won't be a nice bedtime story, but it is a story, I guess.</p>
                        <p>03:30 Peter: Yeah. It's not our usual, really, enjoyable set of facts. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:34 Rhiannon: Right. If you listen to this falling asleep, seek help. [laughter] So yeah, I'm having a bad week. Worst day, I feel sick. I don't wanna tell this awful story, [laughter] but here we go!</p>
                        <p>03:51 Michael: That's commitment. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:51 Rhiannon: That's right. Okay, so let's set the stage. The city is Los Angeles. The year is 1976. Just an aside, the three highest grossing films that year are Rocky, A Star is Born, and King Kong. And I think that's actually...</p>
                        <p>04:11 Peter: I forgot they remade King Kong in the '70s.</p>
                        <p>04:12 Rhiannon: Right. Wait, what was your question?</p>
                        <p>04:14 Peter: It wasn't a question, I just forgot that they remade King Kong in the '70s. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:20 Rhiannon: Oh.</p>
                        <p>04:20 Peter: It's crazy to me that in the '70s they were like, "You know, we have the technology to really make this pop." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:27 Rhiannon: Well, and so the three most popular films being Rocky, A Star is Born, and King Kong, that's really fitting to me for today's case, because all of those movies have sequels or remakes, and guess what we have here in this case that we're discussing today? It's a horrific story you've heard before.</p>
                        <p>04:44 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:46 Rhiannon: So a Black man named Adolph Lyons was driving his car one night.</p>
                        <p>04:50 Peter: And I'm gonna stop you right there because [laughter] I would like to have a discussion about a black man in the mid-70s named Adolph. That means in the early 50s, a woman gave birth to a young black boy, and was like, "We're gonna call him Adolph" and someone was probably like, "Isn't that a little too soon?" And she was like, "It's been like eight years." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:18 Rhiannon: Alright, well...</p>
                        <p>05:20 Peter: That's all I have to say about it.</p>
                        <p>05:22 Rhiannon: Okay, thank you. Thanks, Peter. [laughter] Mr. Lyons is driving his car one night around LA when he's pulled over for a broken tail light. He's 24 years old, he is unarmed, and look, like I'm no expert on de-escalation techniques or anything like that, but what happens next seems to be like putting it mildly, extremely fucked up on the part of the four officers involved.</p>
                        <p>05:49 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>05:51 Rhiannon: So like I said, Mr. Lyons was pulled over for a broken tail light, but he's quickly asked to get out of his car. There's no allegation at any point that Mr. Lyons is not complying with orders or even that he had a weapon, none of that. When he's ordered out of the car, four police officers advance on him with their guns drawn, they tell Mr. Lyons to spread his legs and to put his hands above his head. Now the officers continue to get closer to him, and once he is frisked, he lowers his arms down from his head. At that point, an officer forces his arms back up again, but Mr. Lyons lowers his arm, saying that the keyring that he's holding, it's hurting his hand and he can't keep his arms up. At that point, an officer puts him in a chokehold until he loses consciousness, and when he wakes up, he is spitting blood and dirt, he's faced down in the street and his underwear are soiled. So the police give him a ticket for the busted tail light, and then they let him go.</p>
                        <p>06:54 Peter: Yeah. As soon as he comes to they're like, "Hey, that's gonna be $63." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:03 Michael: [laughter] Jesus Christ Peter.</p>
                        <p>07:11 Rhiannon: What the fuck is wrong with you? [laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:14 Peter: I didn't do it. [laughter] So don't blame me.</p>
                        <p>07:23 Rhiannon: Alright. So Mr. Lyons sues the LAPD, and in his lawsuit, he asks for two different remedies. First, he's asking for damages, which is the remedy you traditionally think of when someone files a lawsuit... I'm suing you because you harmed me in some way, and I should be compensated. I should be made whole. The second remedy that he's seeking, which is the subject of the case that eventually makes its way up to the Supreme Court, is injunctive relief. Now, Mr. Lyons wants the court to order an injunction against LAPD's use of chokeholds, meaning the judge would be issuing a court order that bans LAPD from using chokeholds on people in the future. So regarding the injunction, the city of Los Angeles moves to get the case thrown out. But actually, both the district court and the Court of Appeals on this case say, Yes, Mr. Lyons can sue for an injunction, and it's important to note that this is all before they get to the merits of the case. What's being fought over here is just whether Mr. Lyons has standing, which is the legal ability to sue for this kind of remedy.</p>
                        <p>08:28 Rhiannon: So the lower court says, Yes, you do have standing, and the case should proceed to the merits to see what evidence you, Mr. Lyons, can present, and the court will later decide if there's enough to issue the ban, the injunction that Mr. Lyons is seeking. And then the case makes its way up to the Supreme Court, and we're talking about it today 'cause the Supreme Court says "No."</p>
                        <p>08:48 Peter: Right. So you know Lyons is claiming that the use of excessive force by the police here violates his constitutional rights, but again, like Rhi said, what's important here is what he's asking for. He's saying that he wants money for the harm done, yes, but also he's asking for an injunction, and we've discussed injunctions in the past, it's just a court order to tell someone to stop doing something generally speaking. So he's asking that the Court issue an injunction that orders the LAPD to stop using chokeholds, but the court refuses to order the LAPD to stop. And the reason that they give is that they claim the court can only issue an injunction when it's necessary to prevent harm against the plaintiff, which in this case is Lyons.</p>
                        <p>09:29 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>09:29 Peter: To use an example, let's say your neighbor is renovating, and you think the construction is going to damage your 38 square foot studio apartment. [laughter] I used demographic data on our listeners to target that. [laughter] So you ask the court to stop him, right? But the court's not just gonna stop him because you ask. They are going to ask that you show that the renovations are gonna cause some harm to come to you. So Lyons is saying, "Hey, make them stop using chokeholds in the future." And the court saying, "Well, even if they keep using chokeholds in the future, you can't prove that they'll use them on you. So we can't stop them from doing that." And like Rhi mentioned, this is a concept we've talked about before, often used by conservatives to impede the progress of litigation, called standing. You can only see if you've been hurt or in the case of injunctions if you can show that the injunction will prevent you from being hurt in the future. So since you can't prove he'll be hurt by police chokeholds in the future, the court tosses his request out.</p>
                        <p>10:32 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:33 Peter: And what the court does specifically is create a standard for whether they could issue an injunction called the realistic threat standard. So basically they say there's no realistic threat that Lyons will be put into a chokehold in the future so they can't force the police to stop using them.</p>
                        <p>10:47 Michael: Right, and this is, I think, really problematic. It's like this probabilistic model of standing.</p>
                        <p>10:54 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:54 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:55 Michael: They're not saying there's no chance that he won't end up in another police chokehold, it's just... It's not a realistic chance on their judgment. But in this case, as is often the case with these, there's no real data, there's no like good objective answer. They can't say there's an actual probability. It's pretty much like a gut intuition or maybe a loosely supported conclusion.</p>
                        <p>11:20 Rhiannon: Right. They haven't even gone to trial yet, so there hasn't been evidence presented over this issue.</p>
                        <p>11:25 Michael: Right, and so what you get is their biases fill in the gaps. There is a similar case that you'll read in law school called Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw, where this sort of realistic threat standard was met, and it was like property owners who were concerned that people were dumping pollution into their waterways. And it's like, well, yeah, everybody on the courts a fucking homeowner, right?</p>
                        <p>11:52 Leon: Right, Yep. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:53 Michael: And they can imagine their water getting polluted, they can't imagine getting put in a fucking chokehold by the cops, and so one of those harms seems real and one doesn't, and so the property owners get standing, but the poor Black guy doesn't.</p>
                        <p>12:07 Peter: Also though, if we're using a realistic threat standard, but people are getting choked out 'cause they have a broken tail light, seems to me like the threat's pretty realistic, you know?</p>
                        <p>12:19 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>12:20 Michael: Yeah. I mean...</p>
                        <p>12:20 Peter: They're on a fucking choking spree guys.</p>
                        <p>12:20 Rhiannon: Really good point.</p>
                        <p>12:22 Peter: You gotta stop them.</p>
                        <p>12:23 Michael: I think one of the first lines in the dissent identifies Lyons as like a young Black male and I feel like that's standing. There you go. [laughter] Any police violence claim you have standing for if you're a young Black man... 100%.</p>
                        <p>12:38 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>12:40 Peter: So the court's reasoning presents what we think is a pretty obvious problem. No one can prove that they're gonna be choked out by some cop in the future, which means that no matter how blatantly excessive and unconstitutional a police practice is, no one can sue to have it halted. The court is openly acknowledging that it will allow an unconstitutional practice to continue because no one can be certain that the practice will be used against them.</p>
                        <p>13:06 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>13:08 Peter: Even though everyone involved that knows the practice will be used one way or another.</p>
                        <p>13:10 Rhiannon: Exactly, Right!</p>
                        <p>13:11 Peter: It will be used against someone. This dude had a broken tail light and got choked out so bad that he shit his pants and the courts just like, "Damn, dude, that sucks, man, but I don't know what you want from us here." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>13:22 Rhiannon: Exactly. Exactly. It's ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>13:24 Peter: Is it super simple that chokeholds are unconstitutional? No, but is this case... Is this chokehold unconstitutional? Yeah, I think if you ever put it to the court directly, they would have said yes, even with the five conservatives.</p>
                        <p>13:37 Michael: Yeah, and the court's hands aren't tied. There is precedent for situations like this where a plaintiff may not have the best claim to standing, but there's an unconstitutional practice before the court that's at risk of evading review. And the court will grant standing when they want to, and literally the name of the doctrine is capable of repetition, yet evading review. And the court addresses this and they say, "Well, look, he still has a claim for damages, so it's not evading review, and he could get some money if it really is unconstitutional." But that's not...</p>
                        <p>14:10 Peter: Isn't that what we all want at the end of the day?</p>
                        <p>14:14 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:15 Peter: To get choked out because you have a broken tail light, wake up, spitting blood, pay a ticket, and then get money in eight years?</p>
                        <p>14:22 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, that's the American dream.</p>
                        <p>14:25 Michael: I think the whole point is precisely that this guy would rather just not be choked out.</p>
                        <p>14:29 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly.</p>
                        <p>14:29 Michael: "You can sue later," is just not an adequate response to this sort of trauma, but the court says they're not really interested in having that discussion.</p>
                        <p>14:40 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:40 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, so the court's decision not to address this, it's a conscious one. You have a plaintiff who says the LAPD put him in a terrible, horrific, violent chokehold for no clear reason, and he's asking the court to say like, "Look, that's unconstitutional and stop doing that." It doesn't get much simpler or clearer than that, so when we say that formalistic legal reasoning serves as a veil over the intentions of judges, this is exactly what we mean. All of the hand waving about procedure and standing and the proper remedy, that's all smoke and mirrors. It's obfuscation of what is, at the end of the day, a really simple issue. It's just a method for deflecting from a question that the court doesn't want to answer.</p>
                        <p>15:26 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:28 Rhiannon: I listened to the oral arguments for this case, and there's a really interesting part, which sort of makes this formalism point clear, I think. So Justice Blackmun asks a question of the government lawyer, the lawyer who's representing the City of Los Angeles. He asks a question that's about police training and about whether training policies can be improved or whether that's possible, and the government lawyer just responds, "The court's decision on this case needn't turn on police training. This is a legal question." So what Justice Blackmun is asking, he's saying, "Hey, we're talking about chokeholds, so I have a question about how the LAPD trains their cops to use chokeholds, and the lawyer for the City of Los Angeles just basically shuts that down, he says like, "We're not talking about that right now, what we're talking about here are just legal things, a legal question about standing."</p>
                        <p>16:18 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:22 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:22 Rhiannon: You know what else is a legal question, dude? Whether the police are violating people's constitutional rights in the street, like don't just say that standing is a legal question, but other questions aren't legal. That's just a choice. That's a preference.</p>
                        <p>16:34 Peter: A lot of conservative legal analysis prioritizes rules as if adhering to legal rules is sufficient in and of itself. So here you have this arbitrary rule about who can and cannot get an injunction against the police, but if you have a rule that results in no one being able to challenge an unconstitutional police practice, allowing that practice to continue unabated, to quote No Country for Old Men, "Of what use was the rule?"</p>
                        <p>17:04 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>17:08 Peter: If your rule has brought you to a point where you cannot address the blatant constitutional violation that is before you, that is before the court, you need to decide which is more important, the rule or the violation of the rights of this man and the countless others who'll be affected by police chokeholds.</p>
                        <p>17:22 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>17:23 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:24 Peter: Call me a naive idealist, but I think that's a pretty simple decision.</p>
                        <p>17:26 Rhiannon: Yeah, no, I think that's right. And just to butt in with another thing that that brought up for me from the oral argument, I really like Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens on the court at the same time, that feel and the vibe off of the liberal justices at this time is completely different than listening to oral arguments today, I can tell you that. They're actually interacting with each other a lot of the times, including across the...</p>
                        <p>17:53 Peter: They're kissing.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:58 Rhiannon: No, they're clearly arguing with each other when they disagree with the conservatives and that kind of thing, and there's a back and forth at one point that's really interesting to me, and I'm not even sure if this will make sense the way I can read it because it is a back and forth, but Justice Brennan asks the lawyer for the City of LA, he says, "You want us to say that you're constitutionally permitted to have the same chokehold policy." Justice Burger, the conservative, pipes up and he says, "No, no. They're subject to being sued for damages." Justice Marshall says, "What recourse then does a man have who you've already killed?" Justice Burger, the conservative, says, "It's the same recourse as negligently being run over by a police car, that's a lawsuit." Justice Stevens, "Do you consider murder and negligence on the same level?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:44 Michael: Fuck, yeah, dude.</p>
                        <p>18:48 Peter: Kicking their asses, dude.</p>
                        <p>18:48 Rhiannon: Like Justice Stevens turning to Justice Burger, right?</p>
                        <p>18:51 Michael: They're like ignoring the dumb ass lawyer.</p>
                        <p>18:55 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>18:56 Peter: This is why Burger has that line in his Wikipedia about not being smart. [laughter] Just getting torn up in oral argument.</p>
                        <p>19:01 Rhiannon: Right, by his own colleagues.</p>
                        <p>19:02 Michael: Just going back to a point Peter made, where he says it's an easy choice between vindicating someone's rights or following a stupid rule. Just highlighting how stupid the rule is here. The dissent, I think, does an excellent job of that. What Marshall in dissent says is like, "Look, Lyons undisputedly has standing to sue the city for money here." Like we're all on the same page with that. And further, part of that lawsuit, a big part of that lawsuit, will be about whether the city has policies or practices about chokeholds that are unconstitutional. And so it's absurd to say that the courts are constitutionally prohibited from adjudicating the request for an injunction in the very same lawsuit about the very same policy that they're hearing anyway. It's bizarre, and it's not that the trials would be exactly the same. There would be a few different questions related to the appropriateness of the remedy, but that's it. That's when you discuss the appropriateness of the remedy, at trial.</p>
                        <p>20:08 Rhiannon: Exactly. Right.</p>
                        <p>20:09 Michael: They say this is a standing decision, but really what they're just saying is like, injunctions just aren't available here. Right?</p>
                        <p>20:15 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, that's the bottom line, and that's what I really appreciate about Justice Marshall's dissent here is pointing out exactly that absurdity so that we know what the court is doing, which is avoiding responsibility by using these rules about standing, and that has greater implications than just this case. So this use of standing as the bar to accessing remedies for people who have been harmed by the government. It becomes a trend at the Supreme Court and in the lower courts after this case. Pretty quickly after the Lyons decision is handed down, legal scholars start to point out that this is kind of the end of an era, an end to what's sort of broadly known as public law litigation, and that's because, at the time, a lot of the remedies you were seeking was an injunction. That you were getting an institution, a government body, a police department, whatever it was, to stop doing something unconstitutional. But with this case, that sort of shuts off and says a lot of litigants, a lot of plaintiffs do not have standing to even seek an injunction to even get into court to ask for one. And that's exactly in line with the post-Warren court trend that we've noted many times on the podcast, where distinctly ideologically conservative chief justices who were appointed by Republican presidents, they guide the Supreme Court in dismantling Civil Rights wins of the Earl Warren era on the supreme court and the civil rights movement.</p>
                        <p>21:43 Peter: Right. So this becomes like this big turning point in how civil liberties and civil rights litigation is conducted because for decades prior, you had the ability to go in the court and ask for these sort of affirmative remedies where you're asking like, stop them from doing this, or make them do this to protect my civil rights. And the Court is basically saying here, signaling, we're not going to be doing that anymore, and it becomes a huge impediment to actually protecting people's civil rights in this country.</p>
                        <p>22:15 Michael: Right, the court is saying, Look, we're not interested in reining in the government or the police at all, and if you're wrong, the best thing you can do is hope to get some money damages after the fact.</p>
                        <p>22:27 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:27 Rhiannon: Right, but we're not gonna change anything about how they actually conduct themselves.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>22:32 Peter: Right. That's for the suits in Washington. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:35 Michael: Not the robes.</p>
                        <p>22:37 Peter: Not the robes. Not the robes. [laughter] Alright. Let's do an ad.</p>
                        <p>0:22:46 Peter: So the realistic threat standard, it's not just applied to police brutality cases, it can be applied to any sort of public interest cases, right? Environmental cases... Is there a realistic threat that you're gonna be harmed by this pollution. It's something that has broader applicability and is a huge impediment to plaintiffs who want to sue over all sorts of wrongdoing, especially where that wrongdoing is sort of hard to pinpoint or if it's hard to know when and how it might occur. Another sort of thing lingering here is that due to all sorts of immunities, criminal prosecution against the police is basically impossible. So what you're effectively talking about here is a situation where you have nothing that can address the fact that police can do this on a forward-looking basis, like we have laws saying you can't murder, you'll get in trouble, right? And an injunction would be the same sort of thing, it's functionally a law against it, and because we don't have that sort of criminal law check on police conduct, injunctions are a huge weapon, a huge tool that institutions like the ACLU rely on to actually limit the sort of police conduct that they believe violates the Constitution. Without it, there's really nothing to do that.</p>
                        <p>24:02 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>24:02 Peter: All you have is...</p>
                        <p>24:03 Rhiannon: There isn't another legal accountability mechanism.</p>
                        <p>24:07 Peter: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>24:08 Michael: Right. There are a number of ways you could, in theory, sue the cops. But all this leaves is like the hardest one in a sense, right? Because it's like suing individual cops they can get qualified immunity and injunctive relief would modify future behavior. So what you're talking about is damages against the city or the county or whatever itself, which requires this extra showing of a policy or a practice or a training that makes the city in the department liable and not just individual cops, and so there's this higher showing as opposed to just like, this shithead cop violated my rights.</p>
                        <p>24:47 Rhiannon: Yeah. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>24:49 Michael: So it makes the only avenue for suing the cops an uphill one. And then makes it impossible for you to get perspective relief on top of that, where you stop the practice. It's pretty ridiculous. It's like a fucking... Its Kafkaesque. It's like a labyrinth of dead ends.</p>
                        <p>25:05 Rhiannon: You wake up one day and you're a cockroach and you can't fucking... You can't fucking sue the cops. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:09 Peter: So this goes hand-in-hand with another tactic that the police used to avoid the courts addressing the constitutionality of their practices, which is big settlements.</p>
                        <p>25:26 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>25:27 Peter: If it feels like the court is about to rule a police practice unconstitutional in a case where they're being sued, they will settle that case so that the court doesn't ultimately decide it. They pay out so that they don't have to have bad precedent created that could result in far more payouts down the line. It's a very frequently used tactic by police unions across the country.</p>
                        <p>25:49 Rhiannon: That's right. And when we say they pay out, we have to think about who that really hurts. It's not money that comes...</p>
                        <p>25:53 Michael: We pay out.</p>
                        <p>25:55 Rhiannon: Exactly, we do as taxpayers. That's city money or county money or whatever that goes to paying those settlements.</p>
                        <p>26:01 Peter: It's a real tough decision, but at the end of the day, we're gonna give you two million dollars of your friends and family's money. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:10 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>26:12 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:13 Peter: And this is a great example of how and why the actual operation of the law in this country undermines the goal of achieving justice. It's not just that the process of litigation is horribly slow, which it is... Keep in mind, the chokehold incident occurred six years before the Supreme Court hears the case. It's also that our legal system is designed in many ways to resolve issues that occurred in the past rather than prevent injustice from occurring in the future. In other words, the way the legal system functions is largely reactive rather than proactive. If you ask most conservatives and maybe most lawyers why that's the case, they'd probably say that it's because creating proactive solutions to problems is really the prerogative of the legislature, which is another way of saying that, it's too political. I think, I just think that's bullshit. A court being proactive is not necessarily more or less political than it being reactive, a court stepping in to stop an unconstitutional practice isn't less political than it not stepping in and letting it continue.</p>
                        <p>27:14 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>27:15 Peter: Both of these things are political decisions, they have a real impact on actual people. There's no non-political option, there's no neutral course. Allowing the police to continue applying unconstitutional chokeholds isn't less political than stopping it?</p>
                        <p>27:33 Michael: Correct.</p>
                        <p>27:33 Rhiannon: That's exactly it.</p>
                        <p>27:33 Peter: It's a clearly political decision. And it's a decision that's reflective of the political alignment of the court at the time. The 1970s, you have to sort of envision police power, this is a case where they don't even have an excuse for choking this guy, right?</p>
                        <p>27:51 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:51 Peter: These days, they would have been like, "Oh, we found a weapon on him" and they would have done a press release about how the guy had a, whatever, some domestic violence incident like eight years ago. This is when the cops were just running bat shit wild like they could do whatever they wanted. They choked this guy out, he sues and they're just like, "Yeah, no, we got his ass." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:11 Rhiannon: Right, right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>28:13 Peter: He wouldn't put his hands up, so we choked him out.</p>
                        <p>28:15 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>28:16 Peter: And the conservatives in the court are like, "Mm-hmm." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:17 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, it's as easy as that in the Burger court.</p>
                        <p>28:22 Peter: This is the all related to something you'll often hear and is often explicitly taught in law school, and that's that the law is inherently conservative, and that is horseshit. [laughter] The law is not inherently anything, right? It don't have to be slow moving.</p>
                        <p>28:40 Rhiannon: The law is words, that's what it is. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:43 Peter: There's nothing about how we practice and understand the law that prevents a court from ordering the cops to stop using chokeholds. The law is conservative because it's controlled by conservative institutions and promulgates conservative principles, that's why it's conservative in practice, but it's not inherently conservative. The only reason people say that is to explain and excuse the failure of the law to provide something that resembles actual justice.</p>
                        <p>29:09 Michael: Right. I just had a thought, and I think it's worth mentioning is that there's a sort of shining light example in my head right now of a case of the court not being reactive, and that's Miranda v. Arizona.</p>
                        <p>29:23 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:23 Michael: That's where they said, look, you have to do this. It's not just that you can't do X. You have to do Y. When you arrest someone, if you wanna talk to them, you have to tell them they have the right to remain silent. You have to tell them they have a right to attorney. If they invoked those rights, you have to shut up, leave them alone, and get them an attorney. And this is a cherished thing, it's one of the most well-known rights that everybody knows, everybody thinks is important.</p>
                        <p>29:51 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:53 Michael: It is vindicated entirely, that the court got very proactive about how the police have to behave. And everybody thinks it's a good thing.</p>
                        <p>30:00 Peter: Yeah, and not to mention that, although conservatives on the core have tried to hack at Miranda rights for many years, it has taken them half a century to get anywhere, they have made proactive taking them an unbelievable amount of time and effort.</p>
                        <p>30:12 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:13 Peter: And I think we should talk a little more specifically about how police rely on the slow reactions by courts to their tactics to get away with brutalizing members of the community. It's very common that police will officially roll back certain techniques and tactics when public pressure starts accruing or when a court starts to question it, only to slowly begin to continue or re-introduce the practice over time.</p>
                        <p>30:38 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. I was reading some stuff in preparation for this case and found not only some really good commentary right after the Lyons decision comes down, but also information now, decades after the Lyons decision, about what effect this case had on police behavior. So, for example, like Peter said, chokeholds, they don't have a lot of popularity or approval in the public, and police departments get pressured to change their own policies. So in 1985 without a remedy from the courts in the form of an injunction in the Lyons case across the country, the New York Police Department agreed that chokeholds were potentially lethal and unnecessary, and so NYPD announced that it would no longer use them routinely. We all know that policy failed and the NYPD kept on using chokeholds, but after more deadly chokeholds and the NYPD killing people this way, the commissioner in 1993, Commissioner Raymond Kelly, banned their use altogether, but we know that the year Eric Garner was killed, for instance, the city received more than 200 allegations of police chokeholds. So chokeholds were deadly and unnecessary in the early '80s when the Lyons case went to the Supreme Court, they were deadly and unnecessary decades later when the NYPD murdered Eric Garner, and the Supreme Court has nothing to say about it because the Lyons decision stands for the proposition that there just isn't enough evidence to show a future realistic threat of chokeholds being deadly and unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>32:12 Peter: Amen.</p>
                        <p>32:13 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:15 Rhiannon: So this always brings me back to... I know I've said this before, but this always brings me back to the notion of who polices the police? There has to be institutional checks and accountability on the police, frankly. And the court purposely in these cases takes itself out of being the institutional, legal mechanism for accountability on the police, which is to say it makes itself a weaker institution, but, also it reminds me that we get mad a lot of the times at grand juries and prosecutors who don't vindicate people's rights, people who have been hurt by the police, but we should also be applying political pressure on the court.</p>
                        <p>32:55 Peter: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>32:57 Michael: Agree 100%.</p>
                        <p>32:58 Rhiannon: Here's the thing that makes me so mad about this case, if you have two brain cells in 2020, you know that the police are a deeply rotten institution. You know that the practice of American policing is ineffective at fulfilling its stated purposes, it's expensive, and it's dangerous to large portions of the public, and it makes us less safe. But I think what people maybe don't know or don't widely talk about is that the police are like this because of the law, and in particular, in the case of the police, it's my opinion that it's exactly this kind of judge-made law that has institutionally upheld these kinds of practices. The Power wielded this way between the court and the police frankly, it's an institutional macro-aggression on people of color in this country, and Lyons is just one example. The police love to individualize harm, to explain away the mistakes that they make, they love to say something like, for example, it's not a department-wide practice or policy, maybe an individual officer made a mistake, maybe there's a bad apple, right?</p>
                        <p>34:00 Rhiannon: But the court is doing that too, we all know that police conduct themselves with an act first, justify it later mentality. We know now that they operate in a legal space where they can prioritize supposed officer safety over the safety of our communities. And that's because of the court and the way that the court has individualized the harm that's done by the police over and over and over again. Saying that a man who has been nearly killed by a police chokehold, who has permanent damage to his throat by a police chokehold. Can't challenge the use of a future chokehold because he can't individually prove that the police will put him in another potentially fatal chokehold is absurd. And it's absurd because it's individualizing harm that is racist and falls on an entire section of the community not just one man.</p>
                        <p>34:51 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>34:51 Rhiannon: The court isn't acting like an institutional check on the police, it's acting in concert with the police to perpetuate racist violence.</p>
                        <p>34:58 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Peter: Yeah. And one consequence of how slowly courts move on this shit is that any efforts by civil rights organizations to use litigation against the police department essentially becomes a game of whack-a-mole where it takes years to strike down these practices while the police can just alter the practice in question, just enough to make it like potentially Constitutional or just move on to using a slightly different violent practice that has the same basic effect. And if courts were empowered to move more quickly and act more proactively, you could see an end to this sort of cycle. You can sort of see over time... I would love for one of our listeners who knows more about police tactics to weigh in on the evolution of some of these 'cause you can just see that people were like, "Well, why do you keep killing people in these situations?" And they were like, "Don't worry. We've invented a device that simply shoots them with electricity all throughout their body to the point where they will freeze up and collapse on the ground, so don't worry, we've created an incredibly humane solution." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:03 Rhiannon: Right, right. Problem solved.</p>
                        <p>36:03 Peter: It's like how the death penalty evolves, where they were like chopping off your head that is grotesque, hanging that is grotesque, we're gonna put you in a room and slowly fill it with gas... Just class it up in here, right? [laughter] And then they were like, No, that's awful. Let's do the electricity until they die thing, it's gonna take 10 minutes and they're gonna slowly succumb to the electricity. And then eventually someone was like, "No, no, no, that's insane. Let's do terrible poison in their body. Is this good?"</p>
                        <p>36:33 Rhiannon: Strap em down and inject it.</p>
                        <p>36:35 Peter: It's like, there's no good way motherfuckers. [laughter] And it's the same thing with cops. It's like, No, dude, as long as your goal is to violently accost and subdue people, it's gonna be horrific.</p>
                        <p>36:45 Rhiannon: Exactly '</p>
                        <p>36:48 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>36:49 Peter: And this case struck me in particular because the court notes that the LAPD did in fact halt the use of chokeholds in the wake of this incident. And I thought that was interesting 'cause this was in late 70s, early 80s.</p>
                        <p>37:03 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:03 Peter: But just about three months ago, I read an article about how the LAPD was gonna stop using chokeholds following the death of George Floyd.</p>
                        <p>37:11 Rhiannon: Hmm.</p>
                        <p>37:13 Michael: Interesting.</p>
                        <p>37:14 Peter: So in short, in the late 70s or so, the LAPD said they would stop using chokeholds, almost certainly so that they could look like they were acting in good faith while this case played out in the courts, but once the coast was clear they started using them again for 40 years.</p>
                        <p>37:27 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:28 Peter: So the court's failure to address this led to 40 years of police abuses. That's the cost of a court that isn't proactive, right? That doesn't try to actively solve these problems. And to put this in a more concrete human terms, if in 1982 the Supreme Court holds that chokeholds are unconstitutional, Eric Garner is probably alive today, and not a lot of people believe me when I say Warren Burger killed Eric Garner, but it's true. He did it. He fucking did it. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:58 Rhiannon: Yeah. And that's how he should be remembered.</p>
                        <p>38:00 Peter: A moron who killed Eric Garner. [laughter] I'm joking, but I'm not, right? The conservatives on the court treat things like the right to sue or the right to an injunction as if they're abstractions, but they're not abstractions. Eric Garner's life isn't an abstraction, it's the natural consequence of a system that fails to empower people to protect their own civil liberties. So yes, when the court is purposefully ignoring the inevitable violence caused by its decisions, the blood is on their hands to some degree, and they shouldn't be allowed to hide behind the abstraction of the law.</p>
                        <p>38:37 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>38:37 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>38:43 Peter: So next week, we are taking a break, but week after that is Ashcroft v. Iqbal. A case about a man who was detained rather violently after 9/11 and how the Supreme Court used his case to transform litigation in this country into something a little more friendly to corporations and the government.</p>
                        <p>39:06 Rhiannon: Right. It's a deeply racist...</p>
                        <p>39:08 Michael: It's super awful.</p>
                        <p>39:11 Rhiannon: And we're also planning a Q&A episode to answer your questions. You can email or call us and leave a voicemail with your question. Email us at fivefourpod@gmail.com, or call us 512-222-8720. Hit us up, bitch.</p>

                        <p>39:38 Michael: Five four is spelled out in that email address.</p>
                        <p>39:41 Peter: Something we've never once clarified on this podcast. [laughter]</p>

                        <p>00:05 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about voting rights and voter suppression.</p>
                        <p>00:14 [Archival]: It has been two months since President Trump installed a loyal supporter as Postmaster General.</p>
                        <p>00:19 [Archival]: The Trump campaign is suing Montana's Democratic Governor to try to stop expanded mail-in voting in the state.</p>
                        <p>00:27 [Archival]: And they're suing Nevada now for expanding this mail-in voting in the middle of a public health crisis.</p>
                        <p>00:32 Leon: It all goes back to the Constitution, which, believe it or not, does not provide an individual right to vote, something the modern Court pointed out in Bush v. Gore, despite voter protections in the 14th and 15th Amendments. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>

                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:06 Peter: I am Peter, here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:11 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:11 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:15 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:15 Peter: And today, we are doing a special episode on voting rights in the United States. In recent months, there have been a lot of get out the vote efforts, and a lot of people have expressed a desire to vote by mail due to COVID, and in a fairly interesting development, the President, Donald Trump, has said, "No, you can't do that."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:36 Michael: "Don't even think about it."</p>
                        <p>01:38 Peter: And people said, "Well, we want to vote, isn't this a democracy?" And he said, "No, absolutely not."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:42 Peter: And he seems to maybe have ordered the postal service to start throwing out mailboxes and shit.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:46 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:47 Peter: And so, you may have borne witness to all of this and various other voter suppression efforts and asked, how can he do that? Isn't there a right to vote? Isn't that part of the Constitution? And the answer to that is, sort of. The reality is that the Constitution doesn't expressly provide for an individual's right to vote, and because of that, the right to vote in this country is incredibly fragile, and the Supreme Court has never taken the steps required to solidify it into something that could withstand attack.</p>
                        <p>02:15 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:15 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:16 Peter: As a result, the last several decades have seen a steady increase in voter suppression efforts, from voter ID laws, to gerrymandering, to these newer efforts to attack mail-in voting, and the Court has been a major factor in the success of those efforts. So to contextualize why this can happen in a country that your elementary school teacher told you was a democracy, we want to walk you through what the Constitution actually says about voting, talk a little bit about the history of voting rights, and discuss the Supreme Court's failure to find a meaningful and reasonable interpretation of the Constitution that would actually protect those rights.</p>
                        <p>02:51 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>02:53 Peter: And to really understand this, you need to start with the Constitution, so I think we should go to the only one of us who's ever read it, Michael.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:04 Michael: Okay, so let me take you back to 1789, when a bunch of white, male, professional managerial class types got together and wrote the United States Constitution.</p>
                        <p>03:16 Peter: Our fanciest boys all got together.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:19 Michael: Yes, yes, exactly. I was looking... Sorry, this is an aside, but I was looking through some old cocktail notes, 'cause I like making drinks, and Benjamin Franklin, in his writings, he has cocktail recipes that people asked him about, so he was doing craft cocktails back before the phrase "cocktail" had even been invented. They are so very much like modern-day yuppies.</p>
                        <p>03:43 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>03:44 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:46 Michael: So the Constitution kicks off with the phrase "We the People," which, in retrospect, meant the specific people in that room.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:56 Peter: "It's us guys," that's what they really meant.</p>
                        <p>03:58 Rhiannon: Right. "It's just us boys."</p>
                        <p>04:00 Michael: "The fellas, here."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:01 Michael: "We got some things to say." And obviously, the Declaration of Independence had a lot of nice language, but the Founding Fathers did not really trust the general public with any significant power. And so, all the original Constitution says about elections is that voting requirements for Congressional elections are determined by the states, and for presidential elections, each state appoints its own electors who vote for the President, which we call the Electoral College. Nowadays, those electors are pretty much symbolic, because the states pretty much all require that their electors vote for whoever wins the vote in their state, but that's not actually required by the Constitution, and that's it.</p>
                        <p>04:42 Michael: There's no explicit right to vote in the Constitution as it was originally written, and that's not that surprising, if you look at what elections were like back then, there were almost no direct elections for federal office. The voters could choose the House of Representatives, like we can now, and their state legislatures, but the state legislators chose the Senate, not the voters; the Electoral College chose the President, not the voters; and the President and Senate chose the Supreme Court. It was like the vast majority of the federal government was chosen indirectly by elites. And here we're talking about voters, but the voters were just white male landowners, at that, so most people couldn't even vote, and those who could vote had very little and only indirect influence on the make-up of the Federal Gov.</p>
                        <p>05:26 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right. And so that's sort of the lay of the land on voting as the Constitution is originally written, but things change a bit after the Civil War. So the federal government is aiming to keep the South from re-establishing slavery after the Civil War ends, and the Civil War Amendments, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, are passed in the late 1860s through 1870. So the Civil War Amendments, also known as the Reconstruction Amendments, we've talked about them before, but after the 13th Amendment constitutionally abolished slavery, the debate over ratification of the 14th and 15th Amendments was really bitterly divisive.</p>
                        <p>06:10 Rhiannon: Back in middle school and high school, we're taught about these Amendments as a group, but it's important to look at them as building on one another, they're not a three Amendment package deal, and I think it's also important to highlight that these really significant, massive upheavals in the legal foundation of this country were not the result of just the good guys winning the war, and they're nicer, so they know the good laws to do. It was the result of intense, targeted political pressure, of seeing how the South reacts, of thinking and debating really hard and pressuring bad actors to reform a better union, right?</p>
                        <p>06:51 Rhiannon: So the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, but then the Republicans... Remember, this is the party of Lincoln, the Republicans had an immediate problem on their hands. Because of the 13th Amendment, the full population of freed slaves in the South would now be counted for determining the number of Congressional representatives that the South got, but even though those freed slaves counted towards Southern states' Congressional representation, the South was determined not to let them vote. So because freed slaves would likely be voting Republican, and because Republicans didn't want to just hand over a huge advantage in Congressional control to Democrats, Republicans had to think of a way to encourage and ensure that black people in the South were going to be able to vote. And they had to do so without having to rely on just temporary political majorities in Congress, they weren't always going to be a Republican majority, and so they had to plan for that.</p>
                        <p>07:45 Rhiannon: So they pushed for a constitutional amendment, and once the 14th Amendment was drawn up and sent to the states for ratification, of course, the Southern states refused to ratify. And so, what did Congress do? Congress was like, "How does a little military government sound?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:07 Rhiannon: And Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, which literally imposed federal military government in place of state governments in the South, and it required that the Southern states ratify the 14th Amendment in order to lift that military control, and in order to fully re-enter the Union. That's how the 14th Amendment gets passed.</p>
                        <p>08:25 Michael: I gotta give them props.</p>
                        <p>08:27 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:28 Michael: There's some constitutional amendments that I think could use that sort of political pressure these days.</p>
                        <p>08:32 Rhiannon: Right, yeah!</p>
                        <p>08:32 Peter: Yeah. Right, right.</p>
                        <p>08:33 Rhiannon: Like the 14th!</p>
                        <p>08:33 Michael: I can come up with four in my head that I could write tonight that would be worthy of that treatment.</p>
                        <p>08:39 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:40 Peter: So the 14th Amendment is the first part of the Constitution to mention the right to vote, and what it does, is it says that states that deny or abridge the right to vote, with a couple of exceptions, will be penalized with a corresponding loss of Congressional representation. So this is the first part of the Constitution that seems to indicate that citizens have some sort of actual voting right. And the 14th Amendment also has the Equal Protection Clause, which we've covered a bunch on this podcast, which says that citizens must be given equal protection under the law, and is later used by courts to ensure that people's votes count equally.</p>
                        <p>09:18 Rhiannon: Yeah, but at the time the 14th Amendment is passed, not everyone thought, actually, that it was going to really adequately ensure the right to vote. The Radical Republicans in particular, they're worried that the 14th Amendment is, by itself, insufficient for forcing the South to recognize the political rights of freed slaves, so that's why we then follow up with the 15th Amendment. And the 15th Amendment, again, references a right to vote, saying that the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any state, on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.</p>
                        <p>09:55 Peter: Right. So all of a sudden, you have these two Amendments that don't seem to be themselves creating an individual right to vote, but nonetheless are referencing and protecting the right to vote. And frankly, I think the only reasonable way to interpret these Amendments is as if they create a de facto right to vote for citizens in this country. The 14th Amendment says that states that deny or abridge the right to vote will lose Congressional representation, and that citizens must be guaranteed equal protection of the laws, the 15th Amendment says you can't discriminate on the basis of race in voting. If those don't functionally create a right to vote, then I don't really know what they do.</p>
                        <p>10:30 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly. But despite what we think is pretty clear language there, the courts, over the following 100 years, never really seized on the 14th Amendment as the basis of a right to vote. So while courts did occasionally prevent states from discriminating in voting on the basis of race, other sorts of arbitrary denial of the right to vote are totally fair game, so Southern governments reacted to the 14th and 15th Amendments with new and creative laws designed purposely to disenfranchise black voters. Tons of examples, like complicated voter registration requirements, really burdensome residency requirements to qualify as a voter. Southern governments implemented, of course, literacy tests. These were always administered by white voter registration officials and they were administered subjectively. There were poll taxes, and a lot of Southern governments also did what are called white primaries, where the states would hold primary races, but only allow white people to vote in them.</p>
                        <p>11:38 Peter: Right. Which, by the way, is legal or was legal at the time, in large part because primaries are just governed under a different set of rules because they're run by the parties themselves.</p>
                        <p>11:48 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>11:49 Peter: So there was this argument that this isn't actually discriminatory in a way that is covered by the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>11:54 Rhiannon: Right, right. Now, to remedy all of this, like in 1890, for example, President Benjamin Harrison endorsed the Lodge Bill, which was proposed by Republicans in Congress, and the bill would have allowed for federal regulation of Congressional elections, but it failed. So in the absence of strong federal legislation, in the absence of any sort of federal legislative remedy, lawsuits pop up, and the Supreme Court is asked to weigh in on the efforts of Southern governments to disenfranchise black voters in all of these ways. And so, the Supreme Court struck some of those efforts down in 1915. For example, the Court struck down certain grandfather clauses, those are laws that waived the requirement of a literacy test or a poll tax if your grandfather had been allowed to vote, meaning the descendants of slaves were required to fulfill those requirements, but they wouldn't be imposed on whites.</p>
                        <p>12:49 Rhiannon: So the Supreme Court struck some of those down, but the Supreme Court also upheld all sorts of limitations on voting rights. In 1903, for example, in a majority opinion written by Oliver Wendell Holmes, the Supreme Court dismissed a case asking that black voters be automatically registered to vote in Alabama the same way white voters were, poll taxes were held to be constitutional. In a 1937 case called Breedlove versus Suttles, literacy tests were also held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in 1959. So as a result, the most basic and fundamental methods of voter disenfranchisement, those remained intact because the Supreme Court said they were okay.</p>
                        <p>13:29 Michael: Right, and it's worth noting that we're very focused right now, and I think throughout this episode, on race, and there's a lot of obvious reasons why, but it's worth noting also that women didn't get the right to vote till 1920.</p>
                        <p>13:44 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>13:44 Michael: And that wasn't as a result of a Supreme Court case, that was a popular social movement leading to amending the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>13:51 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>13:51 Peter: Right. So it was only in the 1960s, when both Congress and the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren started more actively protecting voting rights, the 24th Amendment passes in 1964 and it bans literacy tests. In 1965, the Voting Rights Act is passed, further protecting the minority vote. At the same time, the Court is handing down seminal decisions protecting voting rights, using the 14th Amendment to apply a principle of one man one vote, saying that the Equal Protection Clause mandates that each vote be treated equally.</p>
                        <p>14:28 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:28 Peter: So in 1966, the Court strikes down certain racist redistricting practices, they strike down poll taxes the same year, so in general, there appeared to be an appetite on the Court to use the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to see the vote protected, with a focus on protecting minorities from the disenfranchisement that they'd been subject to since Reconstruction began, really.</p>
                        <p>14:51 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:51 Michael: Right, but as we've noted many times in the course of doing this podcast, that the Court after the Warren era, the last 40 years or 50 years, really, was and is deeply reactionary, and that's not a fluke, it's deeply embedded in the conservative judicial bench. Just for a couple of examples, we've talked about what an all-time piece of shit Bill Rehnquist was, but something I don't think we've mentioned before, is that in the early '60s, he almost certainly personally engaged in a campaign of voter intimidation and harassment aimed at black people in Phoenix. Four witnesses testified, under oath, in front of Congress, about seeing him do this, and he denied it under oath, probably perjuring himself.</p>
                        <p>15:37 Rhiannon: Love that.</p>
                        <p>15:38 Michael: This was a guy who, as a reminder, was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court just 15 years ago. Another all-time piece of shit we've mentioned before is Robert Bork, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in the late '80s, but ultimately didn't get 50 votes, and his loss is still like... Makes him a martyr for conservatives.</p>
                        <p>15:56 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:57 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:57 Leon: Some things about him is he thought poll taxes and literacy tests were constitutional, but that the Voting Rights Act was not constitutional, so...</p>
                        <p>16:06 Rhiannon: Great.</p>
                        <p>16:07 Michael: These are the intellectual leaders in conservative legal circles, so it's not a surprise that the Court spent the last few decades punching holes in the right to vote. In 1980, for example, the Court upheld at-large elections in Mobile, Alabama, despite evidence that they disenfranchised black voters. Generally speaking, what the Court starts to do is focus a little less on the rights of voters and a little more on the rights of states to administer their own elections, which gives them a lot of leeway.</p>
                        <p>16:38 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's like it becomes a state's rights thing.</p>
                        <p>16:40 Peter: Yeah. And so you have that sort of change after the Warren Court, where the Court starts shifting the other direction, but what really changes the way that the law and voting rights intersect is Bush v. Gore, the subject of our first episode. What changed after Bush v. Gore was less about the law and more about how political institutions began to view the courts and the law as a weapon to help them win elections. So I think the lesson for the GOP was that the scale of what you can achieve through the courts is infinite. If you can use the Supreme Court to essentially steal a Presidential election while everyone is watching, then you can use it for anything.</p>
                        <p>17:22 Rhiannon: Exactly, and there's a really telling line from Bush v. Gore, which is the Court's pronouncement that, "The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for President of the United States." So yeah, that's true in the most literal sense, but the reality is that just about everything you need to protect the right to vote is right there in the 14th Amendment, like we said.</p>
                        <p>17:46 Peter: I agree.</p>
                        <p>17:47 Rhiannon: The 14th Amendment, first of all, penalizes states that deny or abridge the right to vote, and secondly, it guarantees citizens the equal protection of the law, so yeah, states don't have to let their citizens vote, but in a world where every state does, the 14th Amendment is right there to be used to make sure that the states do that fairly.</p>
                        <p>18:06 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:06 Rhiannon: And conservatives don't want to recognize this obvious truth for the very simple reason that they won't hold political power if that truth is actualized in the world.</p>
                        <p>18:18 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah.</p>
                        <p>18:19 Michael: Just 10 years ago, the big narrative was that Republicans would have to court non-white voters if they wanted to compete with Democrats politically. Hispanic and other non-white populations were growing, and the right would have to speak to their interests. I was re-reading this stuff in prep for this episode, and there were multiple political science papers in 2008 and 2009 discussing what they called the permanent Democratic majority, which is just fucking wild to think about it in retrospect.</p>
                        <p>18:48 Rhiannon: In 2020, that just... That seems so far away.</p>
                        <p>18:52 Michael: Good call, John Judis, you nailed it.</p>
                        <p>18:53 Peter: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:55 Michael: So what they said was like, the combination of minority populations growing as a share of the electorate, shifts in educated white voter behavior, and the migration of left-leaning voters into Sun Belt cities were all supposed to lock in decades of progressive dominance, and you can kind of see this dynamic now with Georgia and Arizona and Texas becoming sort of battlegrounds. It's like what they were talking about, but the idea that the only chance Republicans had to blunt this would be to make inroads with minorities just turned out to be totally false.</p>
                        <p>19:29 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:30 Michael: Because Republicans saw another path, which was just making sure that their white voter base, their votes counted for more.</p>
                        <p>19:36 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:36 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>19:36 Michael: And that's nothing new, like Irish immigration in the 1850s led to the xenophobic Know Nothing party. Chinese immigration in the 1880s led to, among other things, the Chinese Exclusion Act, which we've talked about on this pod before. The Civil War and Southern reconstruction led to the Southern redemption and Jim Crow, which included campaigns of racial violence and all the disenfranchisement stuff we've been talking about. And in the modern day, large scale demographic shifts in the last 40 years has led to the Republicans' current sustained project of voter suppression. It's precisely like those things in every possible jurisdiction, at every level of government.</p>
                        <p>20:19 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>20:19 Michael: They're trying to prevent minorities from voting. Voter roll purges, gerrymandering, voter ID laws, attacks on the Voting Rights Act, the elimination of polling places, curtailing or eliminating early voting, delaying or even canceling elections, impediments to mail-in voting. These strategies are crucial to the continued power of the Republican party, and they are possible only because the Supreme Court has refused to recognize a strong right to vote in the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>20:50 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:51 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>20:51 Michael: The Court isn't a passive observer here. John Roberts and Sam Alito and all them are not just watching history unfold, it's central to this strategy. And we've told you a lot about that in this podcast, in Bush v. Gore, when we talk about Citizens United, about campaign finance, Shelby County, which was about the Voting Rights Act, RNC v. DNC, which was about absentee voting deadlines in the primaries during COVID this year, our term wrap-up when we discussed how they've effectively disenfranchised 800,000 Floridians for this presidential election. And there are more cases to come. That's just the start.</p>
                        <p>21:29 Rhiannon: They're coming.</p>
                        <p>21:30 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>21:31 Rhiannon: They're coming down the pipeline.</p>
                        <p>21:32 Michael: We got more for you. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>21:34 Peter: Yeah, we're going to have some great episodes this fall, that's for sure. And you know, we should note that voter suppression isn't like a phenomenon that appears sporadically here and there. It is a centrally planned strategy that is developed by Republican operatives and disseminated throughout the ranks of the Republican party for execution. Trump's Justice Department has systematically targeted non-existent voter fraud in order to suppress the vote. A few years ago, they hired Hans von Spakovsky, some Heritage Foundation freak and long-time Republican operative who has been a proponent of election reform, which is a term that when used by Republicans, it usually means the elimination of elections.</p>
                        <p>22:20 Rhiannon: That's right. That's right.</p>
                        <p>22:23 Peter: Hans von Spakovsky... You know those villains in movies who have a facial deformity and it's central to their character?</p>
                        <p>22:30 Rhiannon: Yes, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>22:32 Peter: And, you know, halfway through the movie, he tells you how it happened and you're like, "Oh, man, this guy... "</p>
                        <p>22:37 Rhiannon: Right, right. "This guy has the motivation to be bad."</p>
                        <p>22:40 Michael: Yeah. The screenwriters wanted him to look as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:45 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is absolutely right. This guy Hans looks like a kindergartener drawing a villain monster, and then you just poke two holes for eyes and you draw one straight line for upper lip. That's it.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:02 Peter: So this guy Spakovsky, he's a long-time Republican official who has been at the forefront of efforts by Republicans to perpetuate the myth of widespread voter fraud in order to implement voter suppression techniques. And he is, without question, an extremist. He is literally building a career out of a lie, the lie that there is widespread voter fraud, almost certainly knowingly, at least to some degree. And in a normal world would be relegated to some garbage think tank, right? But for several years, he has been working in the Trump administration on Trump's Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which is the functional heart of the administration's voter suppression efforts. And again, these are people who have been around Republican circles, but have never had this level of power, have never been given this much responsibility, and this guy has a huge amount of influence flowing through him right now. And he's a fucking nut job.</p>
                        <p>24:04 Michael: Yep.</p>
                        <p>24:05 Rhiannon: Right. Kris Kobach is another one of those nut jobs.</p>
                        <p>24:09 Michael: Yep.</p>
                        <p>24:09 Peter: Cretins like this, they don't exist and they don't work without a cooperative Supreme Court. And we should clarify what their exact role is here.</p>
                        <p>24:18 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:18 Peter: Almost all of these large-scale voter suppression efforts touch on the same issue, which we've hinted at a bit, weighing the right of citizens to vote against the rights of states to control their own elections. And what conservatives have done, and what the Roberts Court in particular has done, is shift the balance towards states' rights and away from individual voters' rights. In all of the cases that Michael mentioned, from the voter ID cases to Voting Rights Act cases, like Shelby County, to gerrymandering cases and COVID-related election cases, the Court has taken the general position that, under the Constitution, states have freedom to run their elections as they deem fit, even if that means that they do a little bit of disenfranchisement here and there.</p>
                        <p>25:04 Rhiannon: Right, right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:05 Peter: And the GOP cannot do this without the Supreme Court. They've won the popular vote in presidential elections once in the last 30 years, their voter base consists increasingly of older, white, non-college educated males, that's a demographic that's shrinking. Meanwhile, Democratic-leaning voter bases like Hispanics are growing substantially. The GOP's electoral disadvantage is huge, and so it needs laws and procedures that disenfranchise people en masse. And those are likely to get challenged in court and make their way up to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court were not playing ball, there wouldn't be any realistic pathway to this sort of large-scale voter suppression.</p>
                        <p>25:48 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's right. And the Supreme Court, the nine Justices up there, they're not only sort of playing ball and the conservative Justices are helping with this voter suppression tactic politically, it's also, I think, we've talked about on the pod, how there is no objective administration of the law, so that comes into play when the Supreme Court Justices are interpreting disenfranchisement efforts today. The nine Justices are well-educated, rich, mostly white folks who, frankly, can't relate to the people who are being targeted by voter suppression efforts. It's hard for somebody like a Gorsuch to imagine the difficulty of getting, say, a valid ID when he's never had to do that, or the difficulty of planning a bus route during the work day to get to a polling location that's far away because there are only a few now left in your precinct. I think it's very easy for them to brush off these disenfranchisement efforts as something that probably only affects people who they don't think about much, and it's just a nominal effect on a small percentage.</p>
                        <p>27:03 Peter: When your fucking secretary handles your voter registration...</p>
                        <p>27:06 Rhiannon: Exactly!</p>
                        <p>27:07 Peter: How can you relate to someone who doesn't even have an ID?</p>
                        <p>27:10 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>27:10 Peter: You're so far. You're so distant from them.</p>
                        <p>27:13 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>27:13 Michael: They don't have a hyphenated last name, where the presence or absence of the hyphen could lead to a challenge for their provisional ballot that they have to cast because they've moved three times in the last four years and aren't at the same polling location as they used to be.</p>
                        <p>27:29 Peter: Yeah. And I do you want to make a quick point as we talk about this, we're not going to talk about the fact that fucking elections are on a Tuesday, and it's just one day... You can easily envision a world where voting is a week-long process or at least on a day when fewer people are working, and that's not like a function of the Supreme Court, really, but it is a function of reactionary institutions who have no interest in trying to figure out the best way to turn this country into something that looks like an actual democracy.</p>
                        <p>28:00 Rhiannon: Exactly. I'm just looking at Wikipedia and this says that Sundays, internationally, is the most common day for elections.</p>
                        <p>28:07 Peter: I love that it's fucking Tuesday here. Is there a worse day? Is there a day where you more obviously have to be at work than a Tuesday?</p>
                        <p>28:14 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>28:15 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:16 Peter: Every fucking normal country has a national holiday for voting, with us it's like, "Good luck, bro!"</p>
                        <p>28:22 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. Elections in India and the Czech Republic are held over multiple days.</p>
                        <p>28:27 Peter: That's what I'm fucking talking about, dude. It should be a year long.</p>
                        <p>28:30 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>28:30 Michael: Okay, guys, one sec. Let's go to an ad.</p>
                        <p>28:33 Peter: So before we move on, I want to make a quick point. Given that the Supreme Court has literally held that there is no constitutional right to vote for the President, is there anything more brazen than the propaganda this country feeds itself about our democracy? When you're a kid, you don't learn that we are a democracy, you learn that we are the democracy.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>28:55 Peter: The free-est, most democratic country on earth, eagles in the classroom... I had a bunch of classrooms that just had like, just had an eagle like in the corner.</p>
                        <p>29:07 Rhiannon: Did you guys grow up saying the Pledge of Allegiance every day?</p>
                        <p>29:09 Peter: Yeah, of course.</p>
                        <p>29:11 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah, Pledge of Allegiance, every day. We also have the Texas Pledge of Allegiance down here.</p>
                        <p>29:16 Peter: I would like to hear more about that. And what do you say?</p>
                        <p>29:19 Rhiannon: Honor the Texas flag. I pledge allegiance to thee, Texas one and indivisible. That's it.</p>
                        <p>29:24 Peter: That's barely a sentence. That's exactly what I expect out of the Texas Pledge.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>29:30 Peter: All of this for a country where there's no fucking right to vote.</p>
                        <p>29:34 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>29:35 Peter: And it goes deeper than just that sort of soft cultural propaganda. Citizenship tests for immigrants applying to be citizens used to include the question, what's the most important right for American citizens. And the answer was the right to vote. So on top of the fact that our citizenship test apparently includes opinion questions, answers are right that we don't even have. Literally just like ensuring that anyone who wants to become a citizen has to consume, and digest, and spit out the same brazen propaganda that all of our elementary school children do too.</p>
                        <p>30:13 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:13 Michael: Right. And this is also reflected in our foreign policy. Following World War II, when we imposed a constitution on Japan that required universal suffrage for adults. We did the same thing in Germany. When we overthrew the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq, we insisted that they include a right to vote in their new constitutions. This country is so steeped in its own bullshit, so far up its own ass, that we're insisting that these countries give their citizens rights that our citizens don't even have. I just want to note as an aside, other things that we're told that are great about our country, all the veto points, and separations of power, and bicameralism and all that shit, we don't do that either.</p>
                        <p>30:58 Peter: So we should talk about the election crisis to come. We all know we're heading for one.</p>
                        <p>31:04 Rhiannon: The one that's on the calendar already.</p>
                        <p>31:06 Michael: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>31:06 Peter: It's clear that the Republican Party is gearing up for two-phase attack on the election this November. The first phase is what we mentioned, you have these active efforts to suppress the vote, suppress turnout, but the second phase is challenging election results. Very likely, by contesting the validity of ballots. It'll likely be done in multiple states or as many states is needed, and if the election looks like it will hinge on it, it'll end up before the Supreme Court. Trump v. Biden. God help us.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>31:42 Rhiannon: Yeah, and like, "No, thank you."</p>
                        <p>31:46 Michael: The sound of that just put me on edge, man.</p>
                        <p>31:51 Rhiannon: And we're not going to speculate on what exactly a Trump v. Biden case will look like, but definitely we can already tell you what the considerations are likely to be, and it's going to likely be weighing the Constitution's protections of the right to vote against the rights of the states to control their own elections, just like they've been weighing since the 14th Amendment was passed. And one way or another, where the Court falls on that will be dictated more by politics than the law, just like it always has been.</p>
                        <p>32:20 Michael: Right. And this battle is like... It's already underway.</p>
                        <p>32:23 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:24 Michael: So obviously, there's a big difference between the parties right now, where substantial majorities of Democrats want to vote absentee, where substantial majorities of Republicans want to vote on Election Day in person, and this creates like a very clear avenue for the Republicans to engage in voter suppression that largely hits Democrats, without having to specifically target their approach, right?</p>
                        <p>32:47 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:47 Michael: They just go after vote by mail. And so, an example of this currently being underway is in Iowa, where, if you want to request an absentee ballot, you need to have your voter ID number, which nobody knows, and it's a common problem, is that the forms get turned in without this. And so, a bunch of clerks were like, "Well, we're going to send people pre-filled-out forms, so all they have to do is sign it and return it." And so, of course, Republicans and the state legislators passed a law saying, "You can't do that." And then, a bunch of clerks were like, "Well, fuck that. We're doing it anyway." And they did, and then the Trump campaign challenged that in court, and this just happened, where 50,000 absentee ballot requests got thrown out because of this, and there are like another 20,000 in contention in other counties. So the war on absentee voting is underway, right now.</p>
                        <p>33:39 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:39 Peter: Absolutely, yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:40 Michael: It's not just the postal service, it's in the courts, it's in the State Houses right now.</p>
                        <p>33:45 Rhiannon: Yeah, and can I just add an example in Texas, Harris County, massive, massive district, where Houston is, right? Tons of voters. The Secretary of State's office just threatened this week, threatened legal action against Harris County, if it goes ahead with its plan to send applications for mail-in ballots to more than 2 million registered voters. So this is already happening, Harris County, not only huge, urban, but very diverse...</p>
                        <p>34:12 Peter: Do it anyway.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:14 Rhiannon: Yeah, do it!</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:16 Peter: The Trump administration has also sued both Nevada and Montana, because those states automatically sent voters mail-in ballots, and the administration is claiming that sending voters those ballots undermines election integrity.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>34:31 Peter: This is the federal government stepping in to interfere with states trying to increase their own turnout, which should dispose of any notion you might have that what conservatives are actually concerned with is the states' rights to run their own elections.</p>
                        <p>34:43 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>34:44 Michael: Right. So one thing I'll say that's like a positive development is the NBA work stoppage, the Bucks' wildcat strike that turned into something a little broader very briefly. One policy change that came out of that was the use of arenas as polling locations, and maybe some of our listeners who are a little more skeptical of electoralism as a means of social change won't really care. But as we're talking about voting rights, it's worth noting, that's a big win, because all of these are in urban areas that have a lot of minority voters, who are often the targets of disenfranchising efforts. Poll closures, attacks on absentee voting and challenges to signatures and all that shit, and so having a large, easily accessed polling location is a big win.</p>
                        <p>35:37 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:37 Rhiannon: Yeah, and not just that, but my understanding is that the plan also includes using some of those facilities for voter registration and ballot receiving boards, especially if the deadline to establish a polling place has already passed. Again, that's really needed, and can have a really big impact.</p>
                        <p>35:53 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:54 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:54 Peter: So one final point I want to make about these elections, 2020, is that the Democrat strategy is to get as many votes as possible and get them counted, right?</p>
                        <p>36:05 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>36:05 Peter: The GOP will be trying to get as many of those votes tossed out after the fact as possible. But a lot of the things the GOP does to suppress the vote can't really be challenged after the fact. Let's say Trump engages in what I think is the nightmare scenario and creates a police presence at the polls that is designed to discourage votes. Biden can argue that it's illegal, but what could a court even do?</p>
                        <p>36:28 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:29 Peter: You can try to get an emergency injunction to stop it at the time, which would take hours, hours in which people are being turned away from the polls. Biden can't prove it would have changed the outcome after the fact, and no one will be able to measure the exact number of votes lost. When a strategy is designed to prevent people from voting, it's almost impossible to challenge in the courts after the election actually occurs, because the damage is already done.</p>
                        <p>36:53 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>36:53 Peter: All that to say, the Republicans' path here is easier. It's easier to suppress the vote than it is to fight against it. It's just a massive built-in advantage, and that should be something that's very disconcerting, because if the GOP decides to go all-out on November 3rd, I'm not entirely sure how much could actually be done to stop it.</p>
                        <p>37:15 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, there just isn't a legal framework for this kind of thing, and that's part of the reason why the Republicans have chosen that strategy, frankly.</p>
                        <p>37:22 Michael: Another reason why having multiple election days, an election week would be beneficial.</p>
                        <p>37:28 Rhiannon: Exactly. So to speak a little normatively here, to talk about the future and what a legal framework that adequately protects voting rights might look like, the most obvious step the courts would take in a fair world, in a just world, is to return to the Warren Court-era framework of a 14th Amendment. That framework uses the Equal Protection Clause to protect voters, and that kind of court would be returning to using an analysis that weighs the rights of voters more heavily than the rights of states to control their elections.</p>
                        <p>38:01 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:01 Rhiannon: Another obvious step is to undo the gutting of the Voting Rights Act that took place in Shelby County v. Holder back in 2013. We didn't cover that case much here today, but that's because we have an entire episode on it.</p>
                        <p>38:14 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:14 Michael: Yeah. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>38:16 Peter: And yeah, if I can talk my nerd shit for a second.</p>
                        <p>38:18 Rhiannon: Please do.</p>
                        <p>38:19 Peter: There's also a less obvious step to be taken. We mentioned earlier, that there's a clause in the 14th Amendment that penalizes states that deny or abridge their citizens right to vote, and it penalizes them by lowering their congressional representation proportionately. In other words, states are apportioned Congressmen based on their population, so if you deny ex-citizens their right to vote, your share of congressional representatives would decrease accordingly. And believe it or not, this clause has really never been enforced, for a bunch of reasons. It's logistically difficult to implement, and there's a lot of political pressure by Southern states, frankly, to not enforce it, and as a result, courts have more or less given up on it and impact litigation attorneys at the ACLU, for example, have also more or less given up on it as a reasonable path here.</p>
                        <p>39:12 Peter: So in other words, states are running wild with disenfranchisement, while there's a massive constitutional weapon for fighting against it that sits dormant and mostly unused, and if you want states to take voting rights seriously, that clause needs to be given teeth and liberal and left judges and academics should be working on doing that.</p>
                        <p>39:34 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>39:35 Michael: So yeah, look, it's up to judges and academics to do that sort of groundwork, but what really drives change is popular pressure on political institutions, and I think history shows that. And so, yeah, the Warren Court had liberal-minded Justices, but that Court was more than anything, responsive to the social and political upheaval of the '60s. It's not a coincidence that the Court's greatest period of social change over the last century was also a period of great civil unrest, when people were out in the streets demanding justice.</p>
                        <p>40:08 Peter: Yeah, like we said, it wasn't long ago that many Republicans were eyeing a future where they were courting Hispanic voters, but in a post-Trump world, that's not a real option, they've fully embraced reactionary white nationalist politics, to a point where it doesn't really feel like they can turn back, at least not in the short term. They can no longer realistically think about expanding their coalition, all they can do is ensure that they weaken the political power of their opponents. So the preservation of the modern GOP relies on the idea of permanent minority rule, and you cannot have permanent minority rule in this country with a Constitution that actually protects against the denial or abridgment of voting rights.</p>
                        <p>40:57 Peter: The conservatives on the Court know and understand this deeply, they were groomed by conservative academia and the Federalist Society and appointed by Republican presidents with this specifically in mind. This isn't a one-off issue that the conservative Justices can be flexible on. If they back down on this, the conservative political project in this country will be teetering on collapse. So we can explain to you why the right to vote as it is written in the Constitution is a little flimsy, but that doesn't explain why voting rights in this country are weak. As we mentioned, everything you need to protect voting rights is right there in the 14th and 15th Amendments of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>41:38 Peter: I think we've said this numerous times, rights are as strong or as weak as our political institutions allow them to be, and conservative institutions have a vested interest in keeping this one weak. You won't convince them using constitutional arguments to give up their own power. That has never worked in the past, and it won't work now. One way or another, it has to be taken from them. Because what the Constitution actually means is determined by powerful people, not by podcasters who read the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>42:12 Rhiannon: Yeah, Michael, you mentioned earlier, that some people on the left might sort of be just really skeptical of electoralism, of the power of the vote, of whether or not elections really matter. And I fully admit that I think about that stuff too. Especially in a state like Texas, where it's really easy to just be like, "My vote does not fucking matter in this state, in the current system."</p>
                        <p>42:35 Michael: Or right now, with the protests related to police violence. I'm tweeting how much I'm angry at Bill de Blasio all the time. It doesn't matter that it's all Democrats running New York City, it's still a massive uphill battle to get them to do basic democratically popular reforms.</p>
                        <p>42:55 Rhiannon: Right, right. But what I'm... In prepping for this episode, what I've been thinking a lot about, is how it's easy for us on the left to just throw up our hands and say, "You know, elections just don't fucking matter, we will have power through other methods," that kind of thing. And I actually think that that thinking is a result of exactly these voter suppression tactics. And in preparing for this episode, I ran across a quote from a Senator, a US Senator, he was the former Governor of South Carolina, actually, and this was when Southern disenfranchisement efforts were being debated and were being discussed in Congress, around the turn of the century.</p>
                        <p>43:38 Rhiannon: And so in the year 1900, former South Carolina Governor Benjamin Tillman said this about voter disenfranchisement in South Carolina, he said, "In my state, there were 135,000 Negro voters or Negroes of voting age, and some 90,000 or 95,000 white voters. Now, I want to ask you, with a free vote and a fair count, how are you going to beat 135,000 by 95,000? How are you going to do it? You had set us an impossible task. We did not disenfranchise the Negroes until 1895, then we had a constitutional convention, which took the matter up calmly, deliberately and avowedly, with the purpose of disenfranchising as many of them as we could, underneath the 14th and 15th Amendments. We adopted the educational qualification as the only means left to us and the Negro is as contented and as prosperous and as well-protected in South Carolina today, as in any state of the Union south of the Potomac, he is not meddling with politics, for he found...</p>
                        <p>44:38 Peter: High bar there.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>44:41 Rhiannon: He is not meddling with politics for he found that the more he meddled with them, the worst off he got. As to his rights, I will not discuss them now. We of the South have never recognized the right of the Negro to govern white men, and we never will. I would to God, the last one of them was in Africa, and that none of them had ever been brought to our shores." This is 1900.</p>
                        <p>45:00 Peter: Yeah, but Tom Cotton said the same thing at the 2020 RNC.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>45:04 Rhiannon: That's right. That's exactly the point I want to make. Beautifully put, Peter, is like 1900, people's parents alive today were alive at this time. History is now, and just because Republicans and the GOP don't talk quite so explicitly as this, that's the same exact thing that's happening.</p>
                        <p>45:23 Michael: Right. And it's important to note that bullshitty elections where conservatives are suppressing or outright disenfranchising their opposition is how they keep up this faux legitimacy, but the way minoritarian rule actually consistently maintains power is through violence, and so the longer conservatives are committed to this minoritarian path, they're going to be invested in using political violence, and the longer it goes the more invested they'll be. That's not five or 10 years down the road, it's here. There are endless examples of right-wing paramilitary types getting a pass from cops for the violence they're enacting on protesters. A kid who murdered two people in Kenosha was able to leave the scene and leave the state without being arrested. He had to turn himself in in Illinois to get arrested.</p>
                        <p>46:17 Peter: That's a great point. And it's important to recognize it. Whatever you think about voter suppression, if it's not something that resonates with you, it's step one. This isn't like the end game here. It's the first step in a process of subjugating the majority of people in the country.</p>
                        <p>46:33 Michael: I mean, we just spent an hour telling you about a decades-long project to suppress the vote. Republicans, they're not doing this 'cause they're idiots. They know what they're doing and they're doing it because it's important. It's politically important.</p>
                        <p>46:49 Peter: It's necessary.</p>
                        <p>46:50 Michael: It's necessary, and I think people on the left need to see that as well, how important it is to expand and protect voting rights.</p>
                        <p>46:58 Peter: Yeah, like I lean heavily left. I've never been a big fan of Joe Biden, to say the least. And the one thing I'll say is this, this is an interesting election, in large part because if Joe Biden wins and the Supreme Court flips, which isn't a guarantee if Biden wins, but if the Supreme Court flips on voting rights, the conservative project in this country will be relegated to the margins to a degree that you have never seen in your lifetime. I'm not going to vote for him, 'cause I'm in New York and it doesn't fucking matter.</p>
                        <p>47:31 Rhiannon: Peter!</p>
                        <p>47:33 Peter: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I'll just take three hours on my Tuesday morning that I was otherwise going to be sleeping and go vote.</p>
                        <p>47:41 Rhiannon: Goddamn it, Peter.</p>
                        <p>47:42 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>47:44 Michael: It took me 15 minutes last time I voted.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>47:55 Peter: Okay. Next week is City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, a case about whether the Court can or will stop the LAPD from using chokeholds. You can guess where they ended up on that one.</p>

                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>01:01 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have brought American civil rights to the brink of extinction, much like poachers have to the leatherback sea turtle.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:16 Rhiannon: Are turtles poached?</p>
                        <p>01:18 Peter: Sea turtles are very much near extinction, yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:22 Rhiannon: Yeah, but I just thought that was like the shitty environment.</p>
                        <p>01:25 Peter: No, there's poachers.</p>
                        <p>01:27 Rhiannon: Goddamnit.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Peter: Probably the environment too, if that makes you feel better.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:31 Adam: Well, you can poach them if you just have some nice hot liquid.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:34 Rhiannon: Hey, whose voice is that?</p>
                        <p>01:37 Peter: Well yeah, let's back up.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:40 Peter: I am Peter, Twitter's @thelawboy. I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:46 Rhiannon: Hey, everybody. Hello.</p>
                        <p>01:47 Peter: And a special guest, our buddy, Adam. Adam, welcome.</p>
                        <p>01:51 Adam: Hello.</p>
                        <p>01:52 Peter: Adam is a tenant's rights lawyer, but most importantly, this is a case about baseball, and because I don't know a lot about baseball and don't consider baseball to be a sport because you play it while wearing leather belts, we've brought on Adam who is a baseball nerd, the likes of which Rhiannon and I frankly have never seen. So...</p>
                        <p>02:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, this is, this is...</p>
                        <p>02:14 Peter: Adam's about to wow you, I think, with his baseball knowledge.</p>
                        <p>02:18 Adam: That's right, folks. Thanks for the endorsement.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:22 Peter: The scope of this case goes beyond just baseball, into sports that I consider a little more real, like basketball, and I think that we'll talk about the wildcat strike from last week at the bottom of this episode, and how that ties into the broader conceptions of players' rights and labor rights in sports.</p>
                        <p>02:43 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:43 Peter: Michael, once again, not participating, he was out a few weeks ago, and he saw how much people wanted him back and that made him feel powerful, and now he's doing it again, just to flex on you.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:57 Peter: And to keep up our White male minimum, we had to bring Adam on.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:02 Peter: That's the way it goes. Today's case is Flood v. Kuhn. Like I said, this case is about major league baseball, but it's also a case about players' rights, about labor rights, about antitrust law, about racism, and about how the Supreme Court is and always has been, just a bunch of old rich weirdos making shit up as they go along.</p>
                        <p>03:25 Rhiannon: Yup.</p>
                        <p>03:26 Peter: In this case, a baseball player, Curt Flood, was traded from the St. Louis Cardinals to the Philadelphia Phillies. But there is a twist. He didn't wanna go. The Phillies were awful, and Flood is a Black guy, who is concerned that Philadelphians are racist. Rightfully concerned, I should say.</p>
                        <p>03:45 Rhiannon: Yeah. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:47 Peter: But the League says "Tough luck. The team owns the rights to you as a player, so you're contractually obligated to go play for the Phillies." And Flood sues, claiming that this is a violation of antitrust law. Antitrust law, if you're not familiar, regulate what's called anti-competitive behavior, monopolies, collusion, things like that. So Curt says, "Look, this is essentially anti-competitive. They're using these contracts to prevent me from going and playing for whoever I wanna play with, and that's a violation of antitrust laws."</p>
                        <p>04:19 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:19 Peter: But the Supreme Court, in one of the most notoriously dumb opinions of all time says that when it comes to antitrust law, baseball does not count. So, Rhiannon, tell us a little bit about Curt Flood. And by the way, Rhiannon, you agree with me that baseball is not a sport, right?</p>
                        <p>04:41 Rhiannon: Absolutely. It's not a sport.</p>
                        <p>04:42 Peter: I believe it's a game, but not a sport. Okay, we'll debate this at the bottom of the show.</p>
                        <p>04:46 Adam: I will see you both at the bottom of the show.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:52 Rhiannon: Okay, so yeah, Flood v. Kuhn, this is an interesting and important story, like in sports law and sports history. Everybody knows Jackie Robinson, of course, that was the first Black player in major league baseball, back in 1947. But Curt Flood is a lesser-known Black figure in baseball, and he played a key role in baseball labor history. So Curt Flood was a center fielder. I already have questions right there, which is like, "What is that?"</p>
                        <p>05:25 Peter: It's the center of the field.</p>
                        <p>05:25 Rhiannon: Yeah, you stand at the center of the field, right?</p>
                        <p>05:29 Peter: It's not... No, it's actually not the center of the field.</p>
                        <p>05:29 Rhiannon: You stand at the center of the field and you try to catch it.</p>
                        <p>05:31 Peter: It's the center of the outfield, yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:32 Rhiannon: Adam, am I doing good so far, Adam?</p>
                        <p>05:33 Adam: Pretty good.</p>
                        <p>05:34 Rhiannon: Okay, thank you. He was a center fielder who played for 15 seasons in the majors with the Cincinnati Redlegs -- sounds racist -- and most of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals, like Peter said. By the end of his baseball career, which was apparently successful, this guy is a really good player. He was a three-time All-Star, a Gold Glove winner for seven consecutive seasons. In 1964, Curt Flood led the National League in hits, and he led the League in singles for the 1963, '64 and '68 seasons. Now, I'm told that these are significant statistics, and so yeah, like all told, Flood was a super, very good baseball player.</p>
                        <p>06:18 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>06:19 Rhiannon: Now, in October of 1969, the St. Louis Cardinals traded Flood along with three other players to the Philadelphia Phillies. Like Peter said, Flood was upset with this move by his team. The Phillies had a shitty record, they played in a shitty stadium, and Phillies fans were racist and belligerent. Probably not were racist and belligerent, but are.</p>
                        <p>06:42 Peter: No.</p>
                        <p>06:42 Rhiannon: I don't know anything about baseball, certainly... [laughter] And so, aside from all of the problems with going to Philly, in Curt Flood's mind, he was also offended that he only heard about the trade by mid-level Cardinals management, not the general manager. He expected for the news to be delivered to him in a more professional way. And despite a sizeable $100,000 contract with the Phillies, Flood refused to report to the team, but at the time, it's not up to players who they play for. Their talent is restricted to the team that they sign with, and then that team can reserve the right to keep them or trade them. And the player does not have a say. So Curt Flood wrote to the commissioner of baseball, Bowie Kuhn, and asked that he be declared a free agent.</p>
                        <p>07:31 Rhiannon: And this is a little bit of what he wrote. He says, "After 12 years in the Major Leagues, I do not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes. I believe that any system which produces that result violates my basic rights as a citizen and is inconsistent with the laws of the United States and of the several states." He says, "It is my desire to play baseball in 1970. I am capable of playing. I have received a contract offer, but I believe I have the right to consider offers from other clubs before making any decision."</p>
                        <p>08:04 Rhiannon: So he sends that letter off to the commissioner of baseball, but Kuhn denies Flood's request. And in January 1970, Flood, with the backing of the Players' Union, files a lawsuit against Kuhn and against the MLB. Just an interesting note about the trial, Players' Union representatives had voted unanimously to support Curt Flood in the lawsuit, but he didn't really have overwhelming support from ranking file players. So no active players, for example, testified on Flood's behalf. And no active players attended the trial, but there were some interesting figures who did testify for Flood, including Jackie Robinson himself and Hank Greenberg, as well as former owner, Bill Veeck. And Adam, maybe you're the person to go to for what those names mean, who those people are?</p>
                        <p>08:57 Adam: Thanks, Rhi. So I think Rhi outlined one of the issues pretty well, which is that a lot of the players at the time were, I think understandably, pretty afraid of testifying. They had no idea what the likelihood of success would be of this lawsuit, and they had their own careers to consider. So the players and former players and owners who testified at the trial are as the Head of the Players' Union, Marvin Miller, noted in his biography, they share a sort of background as baseball outsiders. Jackie Robinson, of course, broke the MLB's color barrier in 1947. And he in fact, retired after the 1956 season rather than be traded. Hank Greenberg was a baseball executive at the time, but before that he was probably the highest profile Jewish American athlete in the country. Bill Veeck, which is the correct pronunciation of his name...</p>
                        <p>09:51 Rhiannon: Thank you. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>09:52 Adam: Was a baseball owner with a wooden leg, he used as an ashtray, and he was famous for signing the American League's first Black player, Larry Doby. And also famous for a series of unorthodox promotions, such as letting fans make managerial decisions from the stands with placards and signing a 3'7 pinch hitter to draw a walk with a small strike zone.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:13 Peter: Okay, I would like to talk about the 3'7 pinch hitter.</p>
                        <p>10:17 Adam: His name was Eddie Gaedel.</p>
                        <p>10:20 Peter: And this is an adult with dwarfism or something?</p>
                        <p>10:24 Adam: This an adult man with, I believe, dwarfism, who Bill Veeck had hired as a pinch hitter. And the other owners, after he drew his walk in his one major league at bat threatened Veeck with expulsion from the game if he ever used him again.</p>
                        <p>10:38 Peter: Got it. But there's an alternate timeline where people start imitating it. And it's sort of, I guess what is best described as a literal race to the bottom, where players just get increasingly smaller until baseball is nothing but our tiniest citizens.</p>
                        <p>10:55 Adam: That's right. I mean, I dare even the best pitcher of all time to throw a strike to a literal infant.</p>
                        <p>11:00 Peter: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:02 Rhiannon: And then just a couple of other weird character notes in this story. So once the case goes up to the Supreme Court, the lawyer who argued the case for Curt Flood was Arthur Goldberg. And just a biographical note, this guy had already been a Justice on the Supreme Court. I guess the '60s and '70s were just a different time, but he did the Supreme Court thing for three years, and then he was the US ambassador to the UN for a few years. And then it appears that resume just allowed him to do whatever the fuck he wanted for the rest of his life, including arguing in front of the Supreme Court. I don't know, I don't have any other justice that has retired and then argued at SCOTUS.</p>
                        <p>11:50 Adam: And I think, as just an additional note, with respect to Goldberg, so his oral arguments before the Supreme Court for this case were notorious as some of the worst oral arguments ever on record, because he had actually started to shirk his prep duty, in part because he was running for governor of New York.</p>
                        <p>12:13 Peter: This is the career trajectory of Donald Trump Jr, by the way. [laughter] I don't know if you guys know this. This is the next seven or eight years of his life.</p>
                        <p>12:20 Rhiannon: The foreshadowing. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:21 Adam: Well, Arthur Goldberg lost his run for governor and Trump Junior is gonna win so it's little bit different.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:25 Peter: That's right. That's true.</p>
                        <p>12:28 Rhiannon: Very good point. And then finally, we should know as we transition into discussing the law here, that this opinion is actually a five-three decision. Only eight of the justices took part in deciding the case, and that's because Justice Lewis Powell recused himself because he owned stock in Anheuser-Busch, which at the time, owned the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
                        <p>12:51 Peter: Alright, so let's talk about the law. At this time, every baseball player's contract, as we've discussed, has a clause called a Reserve Clause that essentially said that, "After a player's contract expires, teams had the right to reserve the player for another season," so the player couldn't sign with another team. You can compare that with professional sports now, where after a contract expires, the player is a free agent who can go wherever he or she pleases. And it's worth noting that Flood's original lawsuit included allegations that these contracts violated the 13th Amendment, which prohibits slavery and indentured servitude. Those allegations were tossed out before we get to the Supreme Court, but they provide an interesting lens here, not just because it's clear there is a racial component to this case, but also because it's interesting to me how scared the courts are of digging into how many types of employment in this country are fairly similar to indentured servitude when you look a little closely. And they'd rather not address that. So what's being addressed here is whether this might be a violation of antitrust laws, and what the court holds in a decision written by Justice Blackmun is that, no joke, "Baseball is exempt from antitrust laws."</p>
                        <p>14:09 Rhiannon: Fun.</p>
                        <p>14:10 Adam: And as a quick note, this opinion gets assigned by Chief Justice Warren Burger to Blackmun, who's pretty new to the court at the time, and if you believe the sources in the Bob Woodward book, The Brethren, the reason it gets assigned to Blackmun, is that Blackmun has been chomping at the bit to get a higher profile and opinion for a while, and Burger knows how much he loves baseball. In particular, Burger feels like he owes Blackmun, because he's assigned Blackmun to write the court's opinion, and what Burger feels is a real hot-potato case that no one wants to touch from the same term, Roe v. Wade.</p>
                        <p>14:44 Rhiannon: Little, maybe you've heard of it.</p>
                        <p>14:46 Peter: Look, you gotta do the abortion case, but I got good news too. You get the Baseball case, bro.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:56 Peter: Okay, so let's talk about what the majority actually says here. The opening section of this opinion is one of the most maligned parts of any Supreme Court decision in history. The section is titled, "The Game," [chuckle] and it's literally four uninterrupted pages of Justice Blackmun describing why he loves baseball, but he talks about the history of the game, and he tries to lay the ground work for making the case that baseball is of some unique historical and cultural importance, rather than just a popular sport. And you can tell that he thinks it's so poignant and beautifully written, but the whole thing is just like, "Back in 1887, the Kentucky Hoot Nannies won the World Series, even though their star shortstop, Big Al Frinkley, came down with the mean case of the rickets."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:46 Peter: At the end of the decision, he literally just lists 83 baseball players that just... Just list their names.</p>
                        <p>15:55 Adam: Let's remember some guys.</p>
                        <p>15:57 Rhiannon: Let's remember some dudes.</p>
                        <p>15:58 Peter: We're naming some dudes. And to give you a taste, some of the listed names are Wee Willy Keeler, Iron Man Mcginnity, Scrappy Sammy Brockton, Three Finger Brown, and Whistling Wally Herc. And believe it or not, I only made up two of those, okay. The other three are real.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>16:19 Peter: Rhiannon I know Adam knows which ones are... Adam is like... Immediately knew which ones were fake? But Rhiannon, just give me a stab here, which one of those seems the fakest to you?</p>
                        <p>16:29 Rhiannon: Instinctively, I wanna say that Three-Finger Brown is sounds the fakest.</p>
                        <p>16:36 Peter: But you don't think that I would go that far.</p>
                        <p>16:38 Rhiannon: Right, I think that you're a more subtle joke maker. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>16:41 Peter: That's correct. That's correct.</p>
                        <p>16:43 Adam: He's a real player.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>16:46 Rhiannon: Okay, I'm gonna go with Scrappy Sammy. I think that's fake.</p>
                        <p>16:48 Peter: Correct, you nailed it. That's fake. That's fake.</p>
                        <p>16:51 Rhiannon: Yes, I know you. I know you, Peter. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>16:56 Peter: Iron Man Mcginnity, I can't get over this fucking name.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:01 Adam: That's not a real one.</p>
                        <p>17:03 Peter: Oh, God. By the way, I chose three real names out of the 83. When I tell you there are like 40 of those have just absurd names. It's not real people. Alright, go ahead Adam.</p>
                        <p>17:15 Adam: Blackmun spent weeks and weeks actually drafting and editing this part of the decision, "The Game," and at first it was a list composed, for some reason, of entirely White players.</p>
                        <p>17:29 Peter: How do you not get Jackie Robinson? He got Wee Willy Keeler.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:36 Adam: So Blackmun finally added Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Satchel Paige, after Thurgood Marshall pointed out that his list was entirely White players. Thurgood Marshall, is the first Black Justice at the Supreme Court, of course, still dissented from this ruling. But years later, when Blackmun was asked if he regretted any part of the decision, he said that his biggest regret was admitting New York Giants player, Mel Ott.</p>
                        <p>18:03 Rhiannon: Great. Took that lesson to heart. I'm assuming Mel Ott is a White man.</p>
                        <p>18:10 Adam: He is.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:14 Peter: So the footnotes of this section contain excerpts from multiple poems about baseball, including one poem about baseball that is about another poem about baseball. I'm like, I realize people romanticize the sport a little bit, but come on dude. You're reading multiple baseball poems as you go through this opinion, in the back of your mind you're like, "This is about antitrust law? That's what's happening here?" The entire section of this opinion, The Game, that section of the opinion is so embarrassing that Chief Justice Burger, he joined the majority except for this section of the opinion.</p>
                        <p>18:54 Rhiannon: Made that note, "I join everything except this part, which... " Right.</p>
                        <p>19:01 Adam: And this is the same Warren Burger who, I think it was Rhi that had discovered his Wikipedia page said he was not too bright.</p>
                        <p>19:07 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah... It said he was... He did not emerge as a strong intellectual force on the court...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:13 Rhiannon: You know, all of this just goes to show, I think, that I'm right about baseball, when I say that baseball is...</p>
                        <p>19:21 Peter: Yeah, go off...</p>
                        <p>19:23 Adam: If you're gonna call it a sport... If you're gonna call it a sport, it's a sport for grandpas, okay? Grandpas are the only people on the planet who talk about things like this, and who get misty-eyed over a sport where you can chew gum and eat peanuts the whole time that you're playing. And frankly, that's because grandpas are the only people on the planet who have the time for a game that's this boring. And I don't wanna take away from the fact that baseball... It's not just an American pastime, it's a Latin American pastime, it's an East Asian pastime... But in the US, this sport is for old white dudes... Sorry, Adam.</p>
                        <p>19:58 Peter: Absolutely this is... When you're watching baseball, you have time to turn to your grandson after something happens and be like, "Well, what just happened there?" And he's like, "Oh, he got a hit, grandpa... He got a hit."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:11 Rhiannon: Right. You have to be aloof as hell to enjoy this game. You know those frogs that... Because of evolution or whatever, they hibernate by just like choosing a leaf that looks comfortable and then they just sit still for three months? That's what's happening when an old rich man watches baseball. There's a reel of black and white film playing in his head while he watches the game, and it's his most cherished memory from back in the day, and it's like, it's that time they loaded up the boys in a station wagon the size of a tank and they drove down to the creek so they could practice shooting rifles at bugs... That's what's happening when an old man watches baseball. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:54 Peter: They... If you watch... Anyone over the age of 65 who's watching a baseball game, will just turn to you and start talking about other baseball games, that they were at.</p>
                        <p>21:02 Rhiannon: Right, yes. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>21:03 Adam: Guilty as charged.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>21:08 Peter: Alright, I think it's time for an ad.</p>
                        <p>0:21:09 Peter: So the next section of the opinion actually starts talking about law. And Blackmun goes through the procedural history, and then he gets to some of the court's prior cases. In 1922, there was a case called Federal Baseball Club v. National League, which held that federal antitrust laws, specifically the Sherman Act, which is the primary federal antitrust statute, did not apply to baseball, because baseball was not an interstate business that would fall under Congress's authority.</p>
                        <p>21:40 Adam: And I should say that Federal Baseball itself was a pretty embarrassing decision. It's a short decision, about three paragraphs, by Oliver Wendell Holmes, whom 5-4 listeners might remember as the author of the Eugenics Decision, Buck v. Bell.</p>
                        <p>21:55 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>21:56 Adam: And it's very much a feature of the Lochner era, in terms of limiting the scope of government regulation. So, in Federal Baseball, Holmes writes that, "The business of baseball is giving exhibitions of baseball, which are purely state affairs." He ends up analogizing it to legal lecturers who happen to travel across state lines to give speeches. The idea that baseball was not a business was obviously absurd, even in 1922. But I do appreciate though that Holmes did recognize that lawyers were akin to professional athletes.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:31 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Adam: Shoutout Holmes.</p>
                        <p>22:33 Peter: I love that that was the only analogy he could think of.</p>
                        <p>22:35 Rhiannon: Right. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:35 Peter: He was like, "I'm gonna think of the closest analogy I have for baseball, which is lawyers giving speeches."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:44 Peter: So, in the 1950s, the court had held that other sports, including football and boxing, are covered by antitrust laws, and so this presents this interesting question. You have this, what is at the time, a 50-year-old case saying baseball is not covered, but then recently, they've been saying other sports are covered. And what Blackmun says is like, "Well, look, there's no question that baseball is an interstate business, like Holmes was wrong about that, back in the Federal Baseball case in 1922. But baseball is nonetheless exempt from antitrust laws." This is particularly bizarre because he's saying, "Look, the reasoning in the Federal Baseball case was wrong, but we still have to respect the conclusion and treat it as if it's binding precedent." It doesn't really make sense. His main reason is that he says, "Congress hasn't passed a law that would overrule the court's decision in Federal Baseball... " Which is just... The courts do this sometimes, where they say like, "Well, Congress could have over... Have made a law that overruled our case." The court makes some terrible ruling, and if Congress doesn't go through the process of drafting and passing legislation that overturns it, then the court is doing the Regina George, like "So you agree?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:57 Peter: And it's just... It's just fucking, it's just so stupid. And the real reason that Blackmun arrived at this conclusion, if you take a step back, is clearly that he just thinks baseball is special, right?</p>
                        <p>24:10 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:10 Peter: And he doesn't wanna risk... He doesn't wanna risk a ruling that would be to disruptive to the league. If that's not the reason, then why start your opinion with an embarrassing soliloquy about the magic of the sport, right?</p>
                        <p>24:22 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:22 Peter: The idea you're supposed to take away from the entire opening section of the case is something like, "When you hear the crack of the bat ring across the ballpark, you will know in your heart that antitrust laws don't apply." And that's really it. That's the holding here. That's all there is to it. The precedent, the 1922 case, Federal Baseball is relevant to a degree, but not really. What he's really saying is just, "Baseball is special and deserves special treatment." That's what the fundamental holding of the case is.</p>
                        <p>24:54 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>24:55 Peter: There's a couple dissents here... The best one in my view, written by Justice William Douglas. Douglas, we should [chuckle] talk about for a second for sure, 'cause we haven't talked about him on 5-4, but he's an incredible person, notoriously sort of a curmudgeon who dissented far more than your average Justice, often just asserted his position without providing much reasoning, which, of course, bothered all of his colleagues and legal academics. He once wrote that trees should have standing to sue in environmental cases, which was pretty cool.</p>
                        <p>25:28 Rhiannon: Love it.</p>
                        <p>25:29 Adam: Hell, yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:29 Peter: Another quick note, he claimed he served in the military, but some of his more prominent biographers, like more than one, believe that this was a lie.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:38 Adam: Stolen valor. Stolen valor.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:41 Peter: And he's also... He was also famously rude, especially to his clerks, who he described as, "the lowest form of human life."</p>
                        <p>25:49 Rhiannon: Oh my god. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:53 Peter: All that to say... It should go without saying here, I love this dude with all my heart, I think he really embodies the spirit of the podcast...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:01 Rhiannon: It's... Peter's role model.</p>
                        <p>26:03 Adam: Yeah, and speaking of him being Peter's role model, I do think it's interesting that Peter should omit perhaps the most interesting biographical detail about Douglas, which is that he was married four times, and his second two marriages were with women he met as college students.</p>
                        <p>26:18 Rhiannon: Oh boy.</p>
                        <p>26:19 Adam: One of those women was actually writing her college thesis on his Supreme Court jurisprudence at the time that they met.</p>
                        <p>26:27 Rhiannon: I'm grossed out.</p>
                        <p>26:28 Adam: So I think that that means that Douglas was probably one of the earlier participants in American history in what we might call age gap discourse.</p>
                        <p>26:36 Peter: That's right. [chuckle] So here... Douglas is dissenting here saying, "Look, you're waxing poetic about baseball, but this isn't really about baseball, this is about business, and this business isn't run by any of the 83 players whose names you listed, it's run by rich owners." So Douglas is explicitly pointing out the twisted irony of Blackmun's majority opinion, he lists these players as if to sort of highlight the long and storied history of the game, but the players listed by Blackmun are the victims of the collusive schemes of the league and the teams that have kept their pay down for what is at this point, basically a century.</p>
                        <p>27:12 Rhiannon: Exactly... Right.</p>
                        <p>27:15 Peter: And it's easy to be dismissive of this case as sort of the complaint of a highly paid athlete. One thing to note is that Curt Flood just wasn't that highly paid... In his highest paid year, he made about 100 grand which we mentioned... Great money at the time, worth about 700 grand today. But first of all, most of his time as a pro, he made substantially less than that, in fact, prior to this case, averaged about 40,000 a year over the prior nine years. And, also, it's nothing near what athletes now actually make. And this case was like an early turning point in the movement for players' rights that eventually saw them making much more substantial shares of the revenue that they were generating.</p>
                        <p>27:57 Rhiannon: Yeah, and to be a little bit more specific, this case was part of what kicked off a revolution really, in how players viewed their own contracts. Very few of Curt Flood's fellow players openly supported Flood during his case, but in the years immediately following this decision, the issue became really the focal point of negotiations between Major League Baseball and the players' union.</p>
                        <p>28:21 Adam: Yeah, that's right Rhi, and if you've followed sports in the last, I don't know, 40 years or so, you've probably realized that while Curt Flood lost his Supreme Court case, the Reserve Clause as we've described it in this episode is dead.</p>
                        <p>28:35 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>28:36 Adam: And not only that, but Major League Baseball has some of the highest paid players in American professional sports. So how did this happen? Well, the postscript to Flood v. Kuhn is really a vindication of the American labor movement. And this is where Marvin Miller comes in, who like some podcast hosts on this episode, was a not particularly good second baseman in high school.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>29:01 Adam: That's the extent of his baseball career. And Marvin Miller was really one of the great labor leaders in American history. Before he served as the first president of the Major League Baseball Players Association, he was an in-house economist for the Steel Workers Union, and he was actually hand-picked by a committee of players to serve as, what was basically the first head of the players' union at the time. And as the head of the players' union, he ultimately led the players through the Flood v. Kuhn case, he led them through the creation of these first bargaining agreements, the first collective bargain agreements.</p>
                        <p>29:44 Adam: He led them through several successful strikes. After the players ultimately won free agency, the owners tried to short-circuit it and collude, but the players successfully struck in the '80s. Then about two decades after the MLBPA had killed the reserve clause, and almost eight decades after Federal Baseball, Congress finally did step in to legislate the now non-existent reserve clause out of existence. Thank you congress. [chuckle] So to sum up, the players had tried to get rid of the reserve clause using the courts, and that had ultimately not worked, but what did work was collective action.</p>
                        <p>30:25 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:25 Adam: And it's a short baseball postscript, Marvin Miller, who was one of the great American labor leaders of the 20th century, he was finally inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2020, which is eight years after his death and it was almost immediately after the Hall of Fame changed its selection rules to take away voting power from executives. Curt Flood who died in 1997, is still waiting for his day in the Hall of Fame.</p>
                        <p>30:47 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>30:48 Adam: And I would say that right now, the MLBPA is, or at least probably has been the most powerful of any of the players' unions in American professional sports. Notably, the MLBPA is the only players' union in American professional sports that has staved off the introduction of a salary cap to its respective sport.</p>
                        <p>31:12 Peter: Sports is such an interesting microcosm of labor and the labor movement to me in a large part because, it's the one field where everyone admits that players are underpaid relative to their actual value, you have salary caps and all of these other artificial constraints on players' salary. And the result is you have guys like LeBron James who are 100%, no questions asked, making just a fraction of the revenue that they generate.</p>
                        <p>31:37 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:38 Peter: And the conservative position has always been like, no matter what the context, that these people have no room to complain. But that fundamentally misunderstands the position of the labor movement, which is not merely that workers deserve pay sufficient to survive, but that they deserve to be paid what they produce.</p>
                        <p>31:55 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>31:56 Peter: And it's just remarkable to me that even in the context of these highly paid athletes who are complete outliers reactionaries will reliably defend the interest of management. And the Douglas dissent here is so spot on in my view, because he identifies that baseball is a business, and that Blackmun's position in the majority opinion is not one that supports baseball as a sport, but one that supports the extremely wealthy people who control it.</p>
                        <p>32:19 Rhiannon: If you just think about the structure of the sports industry writ large, you can see that sports, as much as people might wanna say, "It's just a game... " It generates so much money for the people who are in power, the people who are in charge, and the workers, the athletes, the players get a bad deal out of it.</p>
                        <p>32:36 Peter: Right. So I think we should... Seeing as the reserve clause that this case was about no longer exists, you might wonder whether the antitrust exemption for baseball even matters anymore. And it shouldn't surprise you to learn that Major League Baseball has moved past using the exemption for minor contract clauses, and moved on to using it for something more closely resembling large-scale, multi-billion dollar fraud on the public.</p>
                        <p>33:01 Adam: Oh, good for them.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>33:04 Peter: So you have these teams that are competing with one another, right? In a normal business, antitrust laws would prevent them from colluding to do something that would help all of them or some of them, but hinder one of the teams, one of the businesses. So if you're in software, Microsoft and Apple or whatever, cannot collude to try to box out someone who's trying to enter the industry. That's what antitrust law is for, to prevent that sort of anti-competitive behavior. So this allows teams to collude with one another to box out cities that might want to participate in the league, to box out owners who might wanna do certain things with their teams that other owners don't agree with, all sorts of situations are impacted by this.</p>
                        <p>33:50 Peter: Most significantly, the exemption has fostered the already deeply corrupt environment in which owners decide whether and how a franchise relocates. So owners of teams, teams that are, again, technically in competition with one another, have often had closed-door meetings to discuss whether, where and under what circumstance a team would relocate... And it's an unwritten rule that you can't relocate without broad consensus from the other owners. That would be, in any other business a conspiracy and violation of antitrust laws, but...</p>
                        <p>34:23 Rhiannon: Right. Is it... That's collusive, right?</p>
                        <p>34:25 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>34:25 Adam: You'd call it a cartel.</p>
                        <p>34:26 Peter: Yes.</p>
                        <p>34:26 Adam: It would be a cartel in any other occurrence.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:28 Peter: Yes, absolutely. But according to the supreme court, baseball is magic, so it's fine. And the consequences of that are fairly numerous, and maybe the most significant is that it allows the league to drive and influence bidding by cities on baseball franchises, which can result in anywhere from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars of public money being handed over to these billionaire franchise owners. For example, in 1997, the Minnesota Twins told the City of Minneapolis that they would relocate if they did not receive public financing for a new stadium. The League stepped in to tell the city that they'd approve the relocation if the financing didn't come through and that they would not allow any other team to play in the existing stadium in the future. And that's the sort of open corruption that antitrust laws are designed to fight against.</p>
                        <p>35:19 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:19 Peter: But it's just allowed to flourish here because Justice Blackmun enjoyed a nice afternoon at the ballpark. Right?</p>
                        <p>35:25 Rhiannon: Yeah, those hot dogs, they really hit different. You know?</p>
                        <p>35:28 Peter: Well, they do.</p>
                        <p>35:29 Adam: And to be fair...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>35:30 Adam: Yes, however, I do wanna just add another point of clarification here, which is that... I mean, you might be used to using the terms baseball and the MLB interchangeably, but the antitrust exemption as it exists, applies to baseball, and to the extent that the reserve clause does not exist and to the extent that Congress has struck the reserve clause, that does not apply to any other form of baseball in the country except for the MLB. So to...</p>
                        <p>35:57 Rhiannon: This is a really good point, yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:00 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:00 Adam: To this day, minor league baseball players are some of the most exploited athletes in the entire country.</p>
                        <p>36:05 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:05 Adam: In many cases, they make well below the federal poverty line in terms of their wage, and they lack any legal recourse to change that. The MLB and minor league baseball have also been considering, recently, a contraction plan, they would disaffiliate some minor league teams from their MLB counterparts and entirely eliminate other minor league teams. But with the antitrust exemption, there's really no way for cities that are facing the loss of their minor league teams to challenge that as anti-competitive.</p>
                        <p>36:34 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:34 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:34 Peter: Bad news for Trenton.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:39 Peter: Those are the types of cities that have minor league teams, right? Just like... The trends of the world, your...</p>
                        <p>36:45 Rhiannon: I know that Savannah, Georgia's...</p>
                        <p>36:46 Peter: Your Hudson, New Yorks...</p>
                        <p>36:47 Rhiannon: Minor League Team is the Savannah Bananas.</p>
                        <p>36:50 Adam: Well, that's a great name.</p>
                        <p>36:50 Peter: I love that. That's phenomenal. What are other cities that might have minor league teams? I'm just trying to think of... You gotta go to fourth tier cities, right? [chuckle] That's when you start getting the minor...</p>
                        <p>37:01 Rhiannon: Not necessarily.</p>
                        <p>37:01 Adam: Not necessarily.</p>
                        <p>37:02 Rhiannon: Like New Orleans, I think they're the Zephyrs.</p>
                        <p>37:05 Adam: Yeah. Chattanooga has a team... Chattanooga...</p>
                        <p>37:10 Peter: Oh, I didn't mean to cast aspersions against Chattanooga...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:12 Adam: Columbus... Columbus, Ohio. Columbus, Ohio has a triple-A team.</p>
                        <p>37:16 Peter: Oh, okay, never mind then, if Columbus...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:18 Peter: And Chattanooga have teams, then I shouldn't have said anything at all...</p>
                        <p>37:21 Rhiannon: Come correct, Peter. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:24 Peter: And look, without getting into too many details. The antitrust exemption has other implications... Broadcasting agreements are implicated.</p>
                        <p>37:32 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:33 Peter: The employment of umpires, right? And other people who are affiliated with baseball, but who are not players are impacted. And so... It goes well beyond just player contracts, it even goes well beyond public financing of stadiums and franchise relocation. The last thing we wanna say about this case is that it's hard not to view this case and the conversations about labor rights in the sports context generally through the lens of racial inequity, right?</p>
                        <p>38:01 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>38:02 Peter: Curt Flood was a black man demanding power as a baseball player at a time when the Civil Rights Movement is experiencing sustained pushback within American politics and society, right? Richard Nixon has been elected on the back of the reactionary push against civil rights.</p>
                        <p>38:19 Adam: And everyone knows, right? That Jackie Robinson had integrated major league baseball, but Curt Flood, I think deserves recognition, among a lot of other players, for integrating the minor league teams that he played with. So Jackie Robinson went to the MLB, played for Brooklyn Dodgers, but aside from the Major Leagues, there were also all these minor leagues that all needed to be integrated one by one.</p>
                        <p>38:45 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>38:45 Adam: And Flood did that.</p>
                        <p>38:46 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>38:46 Peter: So yes, Blackmun's opinion is awful because he frames a real issue as if it was about the magic of baseball, but it's also awful because it treats a class of people as if their ability to control their lives and livelihoods is less important than his own desire to enjoy watching them play a game.</p>
                        <p>39:02 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>39:03 Peter: So the bargaining power of professional athletes as we mentioned up top was again in the spotlight last week when NBA players went on a brief wildcat strike as a protest for the police-involved shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>
                        <p>39:21 Rhiannon: Yeah. You could say that.</p>
                        <p>39:22 Peter: As they call it... And you all saw the usual reactionary forces aligning against the players, spouting their usual lines. If a professional athlete spends his money on cars and partying and women, they'll call him a degenerate, but if the same athlete takes his time and energy and applies it to effecting social change, they fight against that too, because at the end of the day, conservatives believe that the amount of money made by professional athletes is a disturbance in the natural order. That's why social media is full of fucking middle management losers, who have never done an impressive thing in their life, complaining about how these guys are... "They're making so much money for just playing a game", right?</p>
                        <p>40:08 Rhiannon: Right, right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>40:08 Peter: It's fundamentally disconcerting to the reactionary mind, not just what these players are doing with the large amounts of social and economic influence they have, but that they have it at all. And now we should talk about whether baseball is a sport.</p>
                        <p>40:24 Rhiannon: Okay. Peter, you have the stage, Peter... Yeah. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>40:29 Peter: Yeah. Opening arguments against baseball. Like I mentioned, you are wearing a leather belt when you play, which... That's business casual, right? That's not...</p>
                        <p>40:39 Adam: There is nothing wrong with leather belts.</p>
                        <p>40:41 Peter: These are opening arguments, objection [chuckle] I am entitled to state my position in full without interruption here.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>40:51 Peter: You're also wearing, what's best described as a jump suit that was meant to dress children in 1887 or something, they have unbelievably high socks, again, very business casual, they can chew tobacco while... Just while they're playing, these guys will roll up to the plate, and that's the main thing you do, right, you go to the plate and you try to hit, and they'll just be chewing shit, you could have a sandwich in your pocket out there and no one would say anything. That's not a sport, okay? It's an activity. They... [chuckle] What else have we got? I feel that it's worth noting that, for many years, the greatest player in baseball history was considered to be Babe Ruth, who's like 5'5 foot, just... Like... Has like... He's constantly smoking, he seems to be smoking while he plays the game.</p>
                        <p>41:44 Rhiannon: He's not so much in shape, but he's in a shape which is round. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>41:49 Peter: Yeah. I mean, look, the guy was a bit chunky, which like... No real judgment, but, is that the greatest athlete your sport has ever produced? It doesn't really make any sense to me. It's a leisure activity, it's something you do to occupy your time, it's a game, for sure, I concede that, but it's not a sport.</p>
                        <p>42:07 Rhiannon: Look, it takes... I can even concede, like it takes skill, I would not be able to hit a pitch or whatever the fuck, [chuckle] a ball coming at me... But yeah, not a sport. Adam, you may rebut.</p>
                        <p>42:20 Peter: Yeah, absolutely. Adam, go ahead.</p>
                        <p>42:22 Adam: I think, in baseball's defense, I would just say that if the man who's self-described as Twitter's daintiest lawyer would like to step into the batter's box and take a few swings, he should help himself.</p>
                        <p>42:32 Rhiannon: [laughter] Get his ass. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:34 Peter: Well, since you've resorted to personal attacks rather than substantive argument...</p>
                        <p>42:40 Adam: At par, at par...</p>
                        <p>42:41 Peter: I think we know that I have come out on top here, no one can defend baseball which is a fake sport. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>42:55 Peter: Alright, next week is a special episode on voting rights. Given that the republican party is steadily making voting illegal in this country, we thought that maybe we should talk about it a little bit. Explain why it's definitely gonna work and there will never be free and fair elections again. Follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod, tell your friends and family. Michael will be back, and special thanks to Adam our baseball guy, thanks for coming on.</p>
                        <p>43:26 Adam: Appreciate being on.</p>
                        <p>43:30 Rhiannon: Bye.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <div>
                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We'll hear argument first this morning in case 161363, Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security v. Preap.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:08 Leon Neyfakh: Hey, everyone. This is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco & Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Nielsen v. Preap, a 2019 case that allows the Department of Homeland Security to detain undocumented immigrants who have committed certain crimes for months or even years without ever allowing them a bond hearing.</p>
                        <p>00:32 [Archival]: I mean, they were arrested 14 years after being released, one for taking bus transfers. To me, that isn't the parade of possible future horribles, those are the horribles.</p>
                        <p>00:44 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>00:54 Rhiannon: Do you have your metaphor?</p>
                        <p>00:57 Peter: Yeah, I just wrote it a second ago. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:02 Rhiannon: Great.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:03 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have slowly ravaged America like the Mongol invasions of Central Asia. I am Peter, Twitter's the law boy, I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:17 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:19 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:20 Rhiannon: Hello, my friends.</p>
                        <p>01:22 Michael: Was the Mongol invasion slow? I'm not really familiar with the...</p>
                        <p>01:25 Rhiannon: Is that Genghis Khan?</p>
                        <p>01:26 Peter: They were over time. Genghis and Kublai.</p>
                        <p>01:27 Michael: Yeah, he's like a creepy...</p>
                        <p>01:29 Peter: I've been playing a lot of Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
                        <p>01:32 Michael: Oh, that's what... [chuckle] That's what it is. The only thing I know about the Mongol invasion was that they had horses, right?</p>
                        <p>01:37 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah, that's their big thing.</p>
                        <p>01:40 Michael: Yeah, their innovation back then.</p>
                        <p>01:41 Peter: Yeah, that's what I remember from when I used to read about them in Encarta.</p>
                        <p>01:46 Michael: Yeah, I do...</p>
                        <p>01:46 Rhiannon: The encyclopedia, yes. I used to look up animals, I read about blue-footed boobies.</p>
                        <p>01:52 Peter: You could only look up the basics, it was like Mount Everest? Yeah, you can learn about that. Kilimanjaro? Maybe. Alright, hold on. Okay, alright. Today's episode is Nielsen v. Preap, this is a case about whether the government can indefinitely detain immigrants who committed a crime, even if that crime occurred decades in the past, and they already served their time. This was a 5-4 decision from last year, 2019, with the majority written by our little buddy, Sam Alito. And I gotta say, reading this opinion, absolute torture.</p>
                        <p>02:37 Rhiannon: It's bad.</p>
                        <p>02:39 Michael: It's so bad.</p>
                        <p>02:41 Peter: Not only is it the cause of much needless cruelty, but Alito spins the opinion with his head alternately buried in a dictionary and up his own ass. It's truly an insufferable read where the court engages in pedantic and tortured explorations of, for example, the definition of the word "the" and remedial level explanations of the function of adverbs. When you're reading it, you wonder whether you are reading a supreme court decision or if in fact you are in some sort of purgatory lost to the world and cursed to eternal tedium. You wonder whether you've been reading the opinion for a few minutes or if perhaps it has been weeks. You wonder whether you are staring at the pages of the Supreme Court court reporter, or if you are staring directly into the eyes of a cruel and unforgiving God who has laid out in front of you a horizon-less field of your own suffering. So it's bad.</p>
                        <p>03:39 Michael: It's bad.</p>
                        <p>03:40 Rhiannon: It's so bad.</p>
                        <p>03:43 Michael: It's so bad.</p>
                        <p>03:43 Rhiannon: I can't believe I read this shit for this stupid shit.</p>
                        <p>03:46 Peter: Of all the cases we've read, this was the most difficult just to get through I think.</p>
                        <p>03:50 Michael: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>03:51 Rhiannon: Yeah. No, no, no, no, absolute mental torture.</p>
                        <p>03:53 Peter: So yeah, this is about an immigration law, and there's actually a ton going on in this decision. There are a bunch of different legal questions, there are a bunch of different opinions, there's a huge amount of very convoluted analysis of different parts of the law, but we're gonna keep it nice and simple for you and we should give you a run down up top. There's a law called the we hate immigrants act of 1996. No, my mistake, it's the Apprehension and Detention of Aliens Act, and part of it deals with what to do with aliens, both documented and undocumented who commit certain crimes. And by the way, alien is sort of the widely used legal term for non-citizens, so we're gonna end up using it a bunch here, the court uses it throughout. And we fully recognize that it's more than a bit othering mostly because it literally means other, so we just wanna give our listeners a heads up here. The language the law uses is often pretty disconnected from how normal human beings speak, and we're currently using it in the same word to describe Independence Day-style, alien invaders and people who come here from Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:05 Rhiannon: Great, love that.</p>
                        <p>05:08 Peter: So if you are a non-citizen, aka an alien, and you commit a certain type of crime and you are imprisoned for that crime, the law states that, "When the alien is released" from criminal custody, he or she can be indefinitely detained pending their deportation hearing. And the central issue here is what "when the alien is released" actually means. Does it mean right after they're released, or does it mean any time after they're released, so that the government can swoop in 10 or 15 years later after they've served their time and have built themselves a life and a family and detain them indefinitely? If one of those sounds drastically less humane than the other, you can figure out which way the court went here. The real lesson of this case isn't really about how wrong the court got it for once, it's about the futility of assuming that you can, in an objective sense, correctly interpret the law and what the human cost of that assumption is, and what we should be doing instead. So Rhiannon, teach us a little bit about immigration law and the poor folks who got caught up in it.</p>
                        <p>06:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, sorry to bring you guys more bad news this week, but it's another shitty case with a lot of terribly hurt people. Welcome back to the show, everybody. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:35 Michael: Are we ever gonna do a good case? One week we should change it up.</p>
                        <p>06:38 Rhiannon: Maybe.</p>
                        <p>06:39 Peter: We did Bostock.</p>
                        <p>06:39 Michael: That's true. We did Bostock.</p>
                        <p>06:42 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right.</p>
                        <p>06:42 Michael: We don't wanna spoil our listeners too much.</p>
                        <p>06:43 Peter: One out of every 30 episodes.</p>
                        <p>06:50 Rhiannon: Alright. So for purposes of this case, I think we have to talk about the immigration law background a little bit. Like Peter said, it's super, super complicated, but just kind of looking at this case, we are talking about two groups of immigrants who are facing removal proceedings. In immigration law, the term "removal proceedings" means that you're facing deportation, and so there are two groups of non-citizens who are facing deportation. So the first group, the standard removable aliens, those people are non-citizens, immigrants who are facing deportation because of a variety of the typical reasons that you might automatically or easily think of, like say, if you were caught coming into the US and you don't have the necessary documentation to make your entry legal, like ICE has information that you're undocumented, they can pick you up, they will put you in ICE detention, which is jail, and then court proceedings start regarding whether you really are here unlawfully and whether you will be deported. And in that case, while your removal proceedings are ongoing in court, you're in jail, but you are entitled to a bond hearing in which a judge can decide that you can be released if you pay a certain bail amount or something like that, that you can be released while you wait for the final decision on whether you will be deported, you'd be out on bond, just like you were if you were awaiting trial on a criminal charge and you were out on bond.</p>
                        <p>08:16 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>08:17 Rhiannon: Now, for the other group, the so-called criminal aliens, the circumstances around this immigration detention are different according to this law. Criminal aliens are non-citizens who have been convicted of certain crimes while they were in the US, and what this law establishes is that those people are subject to what's called a mandatory detention, which means that you will get picked up by ICE, you're put in immigration detention, but while your deportation proceedings are happening in court, you are not entitled to a bond hearing, you're gonna wait in jail until the court decides if you're gonna be deported or not. And so a quick example, this might be like... You're a lawful permanent resident, a lot of times, we refer to this as somebody who has their green card, you get arrested one night for possession of marijuana, say, and you end up being found guilty of possession of marijuana in criminal court, you go to jail, that makes you a criminal alien, which means you are now subject to losing your permanent resident status and being deported. So ICE can come pick you up after you've done your time on the marijuana charge but in this category, you are in mandatory detention, so you do not have a bond hearing. Now, waiting in ICE detention during removal proceedings is significant, I think for two broad reasons. Number one, almost every person locked up by the government in the US is entitled by the Constitution to a bond hearing.</p>
                        <p>09:42 Rhiannon: Constitutionally, if you're an accused triple-ax murderer, you still get a hearing in court when you're arrested on whether you're gonna get a bond or not, whether you can be released while you wait for the court proceedings to finish up. And the other reason why waiting in ICE detention is significant here is that the removal proceedings, immigration court, these are not quick proceedings. Immigration courts are notoriously and violently and inhumanely inefficient. These courts, they process millions of cases, there aren't enough immigration court judges, court dates are sometimes set years in the future, literal years. So if you are a criminal alien under this law, you are literally caged for months or years while you wait for the deportation decision and you're never entitled to a bond hearing. So to better explain, we can talk about the specific cases of the people involved in Nielsen v. Preap. This is a class action lawsuit actually, it was originally brought by a few lead plaintiffs, but the argument they're making is for all of the criminal aliens subject to this mandatory detention scheme in California. One of the lead plaintiffs is Mony Preap. Mr. Preap was born to Cambodian parents in a refugee camp, and he had lived in the US lawfully since 1981.</p>
                        <p>11:05 Rhiannon: Now, in 2006, he was convicted of just misdemeanor possession of marijuana, which is one of the crimes that's on this list of crimes that for immigration purposes makes you a criminal alien. So he finished his sentence on the marijuana charge, but as it turns out, immigration authorities didn't arrest him right then when he was released, they arrested him in 2013, seven years later, and they held him without bail until his deportation proceedings were finished. Now, an important note here is that Mr. Preap was eligible for cancellation of removal, which means that he was not deported, he was allowed to stay in the US at the end of those removal proceedings.</p>
                        <p>11:42 Peter: Wow. That monster still lives here?</p>
                        <p>11:46 Rhiannon: Right, yeah. [laughter] That monster who in 2006 was convicted of having marijuana and then wasn't arrested by ICE until 2013? Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:54 Peter: This is why we needed Trump to come in here and clean this mess up.</p>
                        <p>12:01 Rhiannon: Another one of the lead plaintiffs, Eduardo Vega Padilla, he arrived in the US as a toddler and had been a lawful permanent resident for 52 years. I mean, this entire man's life, he's in the US, right? He has six grandchildren, all of them US citizens, but back in 1997, he was convicted of a couple of drug charges, and then after being convicted of possessing an unloaded gun, he was released finally from jail and prison and all of that stuff in 2002. He served his time. He moved on with his life. Well, in 2013, ICE showed up at his house and arrested him, saying he's one of these criminal aliens now who has one of these criminal convictions on his record, and under the law he's subject to mandatory detention. So he was also held without bond initially while he was waiting for the final decision on his removal proceedings.</p>
                        <p>12:53 Peter: Yeah, but when he gets back to his home country, he'll be able to find a job by using some of the connections he established when he was a toddler.</p>
                        <p>13:00 Rhiannon: Right, right. When it's like a two-year-old, more than 50 years ago. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>13:04 Peter: This all just makes me think that the actual law should be that if you've been in America for two weeks, you're a citizen now. That's it. If you're here on a long vacation...</p>
                        <p>13:18 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>13:19 Peter: That's cool. You're a citizen now. You're one of us. Congrats.</p>
                        <p>13:19 Rhiannon: Why not? You're here, yeah.</p>
                        <p>13:20 Peter: You get the little flag and a sticker or whatever they give you when you become a citizen and that's it now.</p>
                        <p>13:24 Michael: The Cuban treatment, man, you get your foot on American soil and you're good.</p>
                        <p>13:28 Rhiannon: There you go.</p>
                        <p>13:29 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>13:31 Rhiannon: If it's good enough for the Cubans, why not for everybody else? So yeah, this law applies to thousands of people who are in immigration custody at any given point in the United States, and these are people who by and large have been here lawfully, they've had some sort of run-in with the criminal law, but they've finished their sentences on those criminal charges. At that point, sometime after their release, they're picked up by ICE. And they might be deported, or they might not be, but unlike all other kinds of non-citizens who might be facing removal and unlike every other criminally accused person in the country, this group is subject to this mandatory detention scheme where there's no chance of bail while they wait for their case to be resolved.</p>
                        <p>14:12 Michael: Right. So they're separated from their family and their friends and their jobs. And if they are bread winners, that means their family's without income, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, right?</p>
                        <p>14:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, so this case is not about deportation or how immigrants get deported or why legally. It's just about the government holding you indefinitely while you wait for your deportation decision.</p>
                        <p>14:38 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:38 Peter: Right. Alright, let's go to a fucking ad...</p>
                        <p>0:14:4 Peter: So let's talk about the law. Again, this is a law about the apprehension and detention of so-called aliens, and it says that if an alien commits certain crimes, which we didn't get into it too much, but these crimes range from terrorism to misdemeanor possession of marijuana, like the plaintiff. Then after the alien is released from custody, once they finish their prison sentence, the government can detain them without bond. And the point of this is pretty simple, the government wants to be able to deport immigrants who are engaged in criminal activity. So after you serve your time, the government will detain you while you await the outcome of your immigration proceeding.</p>
                        <p>15:21 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:23 Peter: Like we said, this is about whether or not these people get a bond hearing, and the law says the alien doesn't get a bond hearing if the government picks them up, "when the alien is released" from prison. So the question of what that phrase means is important because it dictates whether or not they actually get that hearing.</p>
                        <p>15:41 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:42 Peter: And the opinion accordingly, ends up revolving in large part around what exactly it means to arrest an alien "when the alien is released."</p>
                        <p>15:50 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:51 Peter: Does that mean that it has to do so fairly quickly or can it be done any time after? So that detaining Mr. Padilla without bond, 15 years after he was released is okay.</p>
                        <p>16:01 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:02 Peter: And the court says it can be any time after, meaning that ICE does nothing wrong when it swoops in years after the fact and holds them without a bail hearing. Keep in mind, there is no question here that ICE can detain these people and they can be deported, the only question is whether they can do so without giving them a bail hearing, forcing them to remain in custody indefinitely, which in practice as Rhi mentioned can be months or years.</p>
                        <p>16:32 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:32 Michael: Right. The way I think about it is like, how humanely do we have to treat these people?</p>
                        <p>16:35 Rhiannon: Exactly, right.</p>
                        <p>16:37 Michael: How shittily can we treat people who were convicted of a crime?</p>
                        <p>16:42 Peter: Yeah, like we said, there's a lot going on in this opinion, but the heart of it is the court's analysis of this language we've mentioned saying that these people can be detained without bond "when the alien is released." And so the court embarks upon an incredibly painful analysis of the meaning of this phrase. Alito talks about whether adverbs can modify nouns and cracks open the dictionary to define the word "the" in "when the alien is released." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:10 Rhiannon: I hate him. I hate him with my life.</p>
                        <p>17:14 Michael: [laughter] It's so bad.</p>
                        <p>17:14 Peter: It's so technical yet like sloppily articulated.</p>
                        <p>17:17 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>17:18 Peter: I mean, it's just ungodly painful to read.</p>
                        <p>17:20 Michael: It is.</p>
                        <p>17:21 Rhiannon: Yeah. It's horrible.</p>
                        <p>17:23 Peter: Interestingly, Alito throws away the dictionary when it comes to defining the word "when." Asserting that, quote, "when the alien is released" was intended to mean any time after the alien was released.</p>
                        <p>17:33 Rhiannon: Well, isn't that convenient.</p>
                        <p>17:36 Peter: I don't wanna get too deep into the reasoning used here because it's very convoluted, it cross-references across this statutes, like multiple different clauses, but he basically talks about the structure of the statute and says that because an adverb cannot modify a noun, the term "when released," cannot modify the type of aliens identified by the law... Phew. I mean...</p>
                        <p>18:08 Rhiannon: Can someone Venmo me for fucking reading this. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:14 Michael: It's so awful.</p>
                        <p>18:14 Peter: Oh man. It's truly bad. So the law says, when you read it through, "The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who commits certain crimes when the alien is released." That is not a confusing sentence.</p>
                        <p>18:32 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>18:32 Peter: The phrase, "when released" is a description of the time at which the government can take aliens who commit those crimes into custody under the statute.</p>
                        <p>18:41 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:42 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:43 Peter: As the dissent written by Breyer points out, almost all definitions of the word "when" suggest some immediacy, if you say, "Lock the door when you come inside" and I come inside and you're like, "Did you lock the door?" And I say, "Oh no, but I was gonna do it in 15 years." You'd be like, "Well that doesn't... " That's not what I was asking for."</p>
                        <p>19:04 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:05 Michael: It doesn't really address my concerns.</p>
                        <p>19:08 Peter: So Alito's in a bind, right? He has to explain this phrase away. And what he says is that based on the structure of the law, the phrase "when the alien is released" isn't really relevant to whether or not they are eligible for a bail hearing.</p>
                        <p>19:21 Michael: Right, and the dissent makes this point, and it's sort of intuitively obvious, which is like, if it's not relevant, then why is the phrase "when the alien is released" in the statute at all?</p>
                        <p>19:33 Rhiannon: Right, Peter, I think your example was really good about lock the door when you come inside and the word when implying some sort of immediacy there and it not making sense otherwise. What Alito's argument is, is that "when" means something more like, you'll be good at this when you get older.</p>
                        <p>19:50 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:51 Rhiannon: Right? And that doesn't make so much sense, that interpretation of the word when. When you're talking about congress writing a statute that's about picking up people and putting them into custody, right? It doesn't make so much logical sense to interpret it as just sort of amorphous whenever some future date.</p>
                        <p>20:09 Peter: And you might notice that we're not digging super deep into what Alito's actually saying here, and that's for a couple of reasons, one, it's super technical and complex, we don't think that our listeners are smart enough to get it. No, it's genuinely too complex to explain in podcast format, but the second part is that frankly, we don't think that the majority's reasoning here is super off base. I think that Alito's interpretation is awkward, and it's worse than the dissent's interpretation, but it's not outrageous or anything. It's not one of those cases where you're like, "this is just offensive."</p>
                        <p>20:49 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>20:50 Peter: It's a poorly written law, it's confusing and disorganized, and again, I think the dissent is more correct, but reasonable minds I think can differ here.</p>
                        <p>21:00 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>21:01 Peter: And that brings us to a problem that frankly, much of the legal profession is happy to pretend doesn't exist.</p>
                        <p>21:07 Rhiannon: Ooo, say it.</p>
                        <p>21:09 Peter: The task of the court is ostensibly to determine the "correct interpretation" of the law, but what if there is no objectively correct answer? Where does that leave the court?</p>
                        <p>21:21 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>21:21 Peter: If you are intellectually honest enough to admit to yourself that there is no objectively correct interpretation here, then you have to acknowledge that the only way to approach the question of how to interpret this law is by applying some sort of purposivistic, common sense driven approach.</p>
                        <p>21:36 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>21:38 Peter: You need to think about what the law is intended to, what its impact on people is, and maybe if you can see that there's no objectively correct interpretation of the law, you might try to find one that respects the human dignity of the people affected by it.</p>
                        <p>21:50 Rhiannon: Yeah, just try it. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>21:53 Peter: Basically, all that Alito says about the purpose of the law is that Congress wanted to be tougher on immigrants who committed certain crimes, which I think is more or less true, but it's interesting how readily conservatives are willing to refer to the intent of a law when that intent is just some racist bullshit.</p>
                        <p>22:13 Rhiannon: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>22:15 Peter: So let's talk a bit about the purpose of this law. Like we said, this isn't about whether the government can detain immigrants before their deportation hearings, they absolutely can be. What this is about is whether an immigrant who is convicted of a crime, serves their time, is released, and then years later is picked up by ICE... Whether that person is owed a bail hearing or whether he can be detained indefinitely in some fucking ICE run concentration camp.</p>
                        <p>22:46 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>22:47 Peter: So the main purpose of a bail hearing is to allow a judge to analyze whether or not someone is either one, too dangerous to be out in society or two, a flight risk. And that's really it. And if someone like in this case, served their time for a crime, settled down, started a family, and then led a peaceful and law-abiding life for over a decade, there's as close to a zero risk of danger or flight as you'll ever get. And that, when you're talking about what outcome here makes sense, is the bottom line, right? Give that guy a fucking bail hearing.</p>
                        <p>23:20 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>23:21 Michael: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>23:21 Rhiannon: Let a judge determine it.</p>
                        <p>23:22 Peter: The point of bail hearings is to give people who aren't a danger to society, their freedom before they face trial. And that's the moral difference here, the choice between holding these people indefinitely, possibly for years, despite the fact that they pose no threat to society and letting them go back to their lives until their deportation hearing can actually happen.</p>
                        <p>23:43 Michael: Yeah, and so in that sense, what they say is like, Look, the reason why this is a mandatory detention is we don't think bail hearings are adequate for determining who is and isn't safe to re-release into the community here. And look, that's maybe a fair reading, maybe that's the "right reading" like Peter said, but again, like if you have 10 years of information of somebody re-entering society and setting down their roots and making a life, then that situation is different. Now you have more information available. And that sort of goes to the indeterminacy of this, like Peter's saying, there's no right or wrong answer, this situation suggest that that purpose isn't really served by denying these people bond hearings because it's different picking them up 15 years later than it is picking them up 15 minutes after they leave prison.</p>
                        <p>24:35 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>24:35 Michael: It's just a different scenario.</p>
                        <p>24:38 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:39 Peter: So if the text of the law is uncertain or convoluted, you're allowed to use your common sense, you're allowed to look at the circumstances of these people and decide what the most reasonable outcome is, the only people who don't want you to do that are people who insist on believing that the law is a means for finding objective truth. And those people deluded, you're morally obligated to contextualize these cases because anything else divorces the application of the law from the ways in which it weighs upon human beings.</p>
                        <p>25:10 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. And that's what we're saying, like every episode of this...</p>
                        <p>25:15 Peter: Every goddamn episode people!</p>
                        <p>25:16 Rhiannon: Every fucking episode of this goddamn podcast.</p>
                        <p>25:20 Michael: Get it through your fucking heads. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:22 Rhiannon: We say that there's a moral imperative actually to interpret and use the law in a way that at least takes into account it's effect on people, the material harm or good that it does on people, right? And there's actually a part in the oral argument that highlights the point that you and Michael are making, Peter, and it's a nice kind of like little example, I think of legal realism, which is what we're talking about always. The lawyer for the government, which is to say like a heartless ghoul, an extremely ugly person inside and out, he says during oral argument that like, "We have to interpret the law this way, we have to interpret the law to mean that DHS and ICE... They can come pick up these people any time after release and whenever we pick them up, they're going to be in this mandatory detention." And one reason he says we have to interpret the law this way is because Congress wanted to protect the community from criminals.</p>
                        <p>26:19 Rhiannon: And Justice Breyer actually asks a really good question, which is like, well, hold up, the community is protected by providing bail hearings, judges consider all of these factors, they consider potentially dangerous-ness in the community, that's what they're considering during a bail hearing, and they do it all the time. But if we are reading the statute the way you government want us to read it, you heartless ghoul, Breyer says "What you're doing to the individual is many who are no danger to the community, you're depriving them of a hearing that could mean their release, and what you're doing to the community reading it your way is nothing. You'll have the bail hearing, the dangerous people won't get out. You see, in terms of the purposes of the bail statute, or this statute or any other statute, if we read it technically your way, we hurt everybody in terms of the purposes, but if we read it the opposite way, we hurt virtually nobody." And so like he's saying, "why?" You're asking us to read it in this weird technical way, and the result of reading it that way is harm, people get hurt, and the purpose of the statute isn't harmed because if the purpose of the statute is to prevent dangerous people from being free in the community, well a bail hearing satisfies that purpose. But big surprise, the heartless ghoul does not have a good answer, 'cause spoiler alert, the purpose to them is harm and hurting people.</p>
                        <p>27:45 Michael: That's right. The cruelty is the point.</p>
                        <p>27:47 Peter: That's right. And I wanna make a note about government lawyers who are making these arguments.</p>
                        <p>27:51 Rhiannon: Fuck you to hell, I hope you fucking suffer, that's my point. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>27:54 Peter: If you're a government lawyer, and you're in front of the Supreme Court arguing in favor of ICE tactics, you easily could be at worst, a top tier associate at a big law firm, but more likely a partner bagging between 400 grand and like two mil a year. Government lawyers on the other hand, are making tops like 150, which means that that delta... That's how much they hate people from Mexico and Central America, right?</p>
                        <p>28:29 Rhiannon: Right, right. Your soul is trash.</p>
                        <p>28:32 Peter: They will take that pay cut so that they can just inflict harm upon immigrants. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:36 Rhiannon: Awful.</p>
                        <p>28:36 Peter: These people are fucking vile.</p>
                        <p>28:39 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:41 Michael: Okay.</p>
                        <p>28:43 Rhiannon: Pigs. Pigs!</p>
                        <p>28:44 Peter: Have you ever seen a government lawyer who was wearing a decently tailored suit? 'Cause I fucking haven't, not once.</p>
                        <p>28:48 Rhiannon: Never, no. God, no.</p>
                        <p>28:52 Peter: Alright, let's put a hold on this and go to a quick ad...</p>
                        <p>0:28:56 Peter: Okay, Breyer goes on in his dissent about the correct interpretation of the statute, and like I said, I think it's fairly convincing, but then he gets to what is, in my view, a much more important point, which is that the majority's interpretation seems a lot like it might violate the due process rights of these immigrants.</p>
                        <p>29:16 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:17 Peter: So for the record, between the majority and the concurrences, and the dissent, this entire decision is 59 pages long. And we get to page 50 before there's a real substantive discussion about whether these people are being treated fairly under the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>29:34 Rhiannon: Love that.</p>
                        <p>29:35 Peter: So Breyer points out that while it's not certain, this opinion may well violate the rights of these individuals to due process under the fifth amendment.</p>
                        <p>29:42 Rhiannon: Yeah. There's a constitutional question. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:44 Peter: Right, it is, after all, allowing the government to detain people indefinitely, possibly for months or years at a time without a hearing, and only because they committed a minor crime at some point in the distant past. So not only is this unjust on its face, it's less due process, like Rhi mentioned earlier, than is afforded to a mass murderer in this country.</p>
                        <p>30:09 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:09 Michael: Right. And I think it's worth talking about indefinite detention a little bit because it's like a bedrock constitutional principle that the government can't indefinitely detain someone without any judicial process. That's like the writ of Habeas Corpus was originally for an English common law, like people detained extra-judicially could petition the courts for the writ and make the government show that their detention was legal.</p>
                        <p>30:33 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:34 Michael: That's in the Constitution that Habeas Corpus can't be suspended except in "extraordinary circumstances" such as civil war and invasion. And you see it in the Bill of Rights with a speedy trial right. You can't just be held for years awaiting trial, at least in theory, you can't be held and indefinitely awaiting trial, but it's also in the protections against double jeopardy, right? Because if you can keep re-trying people, you could keep them in jail pending trial over and over and over without real process, the warrant requirements for arrest, so it's like built in.</p>
                        <p>31:11 Rhiannon: Yeah. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>31:12 Michael: And even in the height of the war on terror panic 2003-2004, the Supreme Court was not at all receptive to the Bush Administration saying that they could hold enemy combatants indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>31:24 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>31:24 Michael: They extended Habeas Corpus protections to Guantanamo Bay, they said that people accused of being enemy combatants had to have process to challenge that designation. And so this whole idea that indefinitely detaining people without judicial processes is like disfavored strongly should be the background against which we're reading this law.</p>
                        <p>31:46 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>31:48 Michael: That feels right. The government snatching people up, throwing them in a hole and throwing away the key is so fucking obviously fascist that it just seems obvious on its face that the US can't do that. But there are two big issues which is that the conservatives on the court are all fucking fascists and...</p>
                        <p>32:06 Peter: That is a major one.</p>
                        <p>32:07 Rhiannon: Right. That's a big one.</p>
                        <p>32:08 Michael: That's a big problem here.</p>
                        <p>32:12 Rhiannon: Totally anathema to democracy, having the fascists on the court.</p>
                        <p>32:15 Michael: And the other is that immigration law is where the government has the most leeway to detain people for extended periods even indefinitely with limited or no judicial process.</p>
                        <p>32:26 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:27 Michael: We've talked about this before in our Trump v. Hawaii episode, going back to the 1880s, when the segregationists were on the court, and at the supreme court directions in the 1880s since then, courts have basically taken a hands-off approach to immigration and said Congress and President can run wild with this shit and they can be as racist and as fascist as they want. And so there're scenarios where the government is allowed constitutionally to indefinitely detain people, like if a lawful permanent resident goes abroad and is checking out historical sites in Petra or something, and on their way back, the government's like, "Oh, we think you were hanging out with Hezbollah. Sorry, we're not letting you back in anymore." But their home country says "We don't want 'em, we can't take 'em, they're not our citizen" or whatever, if the government doesn't have anywhere to send them, but also won't admit them, can keep them indefinitely forever without trial, without hearing, without bond, without anything, that's constitutionally okay. If you're in the United States, you have some more due process protections, which is what Breyer's sort of getting at here, which is that due process clause applies to everyone in the United States.</p>
                        <p>33:37 Michael: So there's some limits, and I don't wanna start slicing and dicing this really fine. I'm not an immigration specialist, all the different permutations. It's not super relevant. The point I wanna make is that this is an area in need of reform and not just legislative reform. Obviously, they've tried to do immigration reform in the past, Bush tried to do it, Obama tried to do it. It's a big activist push right now, but it's also on left academics, it's also on left legal types, it's also on liberal judges. We need a Federal Society coming up with bullshit arguments like they do, they come up with bullshit arguments about how the Takings Clause means that all federal regulations are illegal.</p>
                        <p>34:21 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:22 Michael: And we need like academics coming up with crazy arguments, like, the Constitution applies to Mexicans too. That's something that we need and is undeveloped. There is a law review article I read in college by Hiroshi Motomura saying basically this point, that there isn't really a good answer to the current state of constitutional law and immigration. And that article was written in 1990, and it's like 30 years later, we're at a good 130 years now of the court's abdicating their responsibility here. And it's worth saying, "What has that wrought?"</p>
                        <p>34:58 Rhiannon: Yeah, I was thinking When prepping this case, I was thinking so much about what it means for our society, what it means for our world, what it means for human beings, that ICE can act like this, that DHS can act like this, that we could hold people indefinitely like this, just because it's immigration law and immigration law is different. And you just think about what good society excluded people like this, and on this scale? That's not what makes a good society, taking people out. Do you all not get yet? Borders are fucking fake. Like, what are we doing? You know what I mean? They're not fucking real. And what makes a good society is like people feel safe, people have their needs met, people have resources, that's what makes a good society.</p>
                        <p>35:38 Peter: Yeah but Sam Alito would ask, define people.</p>
                        <p>35:44 Rhiannon: I know it's the same intellectual obstacle...</p>
                        <p>35:47 Peter: It really is.</p>
                        <p>35:48 Rhiannon: Every time.</p>
                        <p>35:50 Peter: And I think speaking of the damage that immigration law has wrought, we should talk about the elephant in the room here, which is ICE. It should go without saying that searching out these people who haven't committed crimes in many years, is part of ICE's strategy generally and ICE's strategy under the Trump administration more specifically. And the goal of it is to foster an environment where non-citizens are made to live in a constant state of fear and vulnerability, where their lives and jobs and families are always precarious, always shrouded in doubt. And the end goal, of course, is to make being an immigrant in this country so unpleasant that people stop coming here, so that the conservative White culturist blob that makes up the plurality of this country can go to Arby's without having to see a Spanish translation of the bathroom "Out of Order" sign. We see ICE employ these sorts of tactics everyday. They've targeted immigrants who are leaving hospitals or dropping their kids off at school. ICE agents in El Paso told a family that they had to deport either the mother or the father and made their three-year-old daughter choose.</p>
                        <p>37:12 Michael: Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>37:13 Peter: They fucking made a whole movie about that. That's a Sophie's Choice, right? Jesus Christ. These people are fucking monstrous and their tactics are designed to create chaos, and so uncertainty. And I'm not speculating about that strategy here, a Trump administration official on the National Security Council said in an email, in 2019, "My mantra has persistently been presenting aliens with multiple unsolvable dilemmas to impact their calculus for choosing to make the arduous journey to begin with."</p>
                        <p>37:47 Rhiannon: Right. They're upfront about it.</p>
                        <p>37:49 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:50 Michael: Yeah. Fucking Mitt Romney talked about this shit, making them self-deport.</p>
                        <p>37:53 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:54 Michael: That's the whole idea, it's ethnic cleansing. That's what it is.</p>
                        <p>37:58 Peter: The ability of ICE to show up years after an immigrant has served his or her time for a crime and put them into indefinite detention is part of this broader strategy of filling their lives with chaos and uncertainty and a judge evaluating this law, someone in the Supreme Court's position here is not obligated to disregard that, it's obligated to actually consider it. It needs consideration in determining whether this practice is fair or sensible. And the only reason you could think that this is fair or sensible is if you believe that being a non-citizen in this country makes you less worthy of human dignity and more deserving of suffering than citizens. There's no other conclusion you can draw.</p>
                        <p>38:39 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly, that's it. That's all there is to it. And Peter alluded to and give some examples of tactics that ICE use, it's basically the fucking SS. It is a secret police coming through communities, raiding and kidnapping people. Like Peter said, they're at hospitals, there was a report out of Michigan that an Iraqi immigrant was threatened with deportation by ICE while he was at the hospital, even though what he was doing at the hospital was being a bone marrow transplant for his niece.</p>
                        <p>39:10 Michael: Jesus!</p>
                        <p>39:12 Rhiannon: A Salvadoran immigrant, Sara Beltrán Hernández, she was removed from a hospital where she was undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. In another report two undocumented parents in Texas were only allowed to take their infant to the hospital for treatment of a really dangerous stomach issue, if they agreed to turn themselves in to ICE afterwards. I have driven by or been at hospitals in South Texas where ICE and Border Patrol are just set up, and you have to start thinking about what this means for actual public safety and public health. If people are afraid that they're gonna be picked up by fucking ICE, by the police at the hospital, then people don't go to the hospital. You're discouraging people from going to the hospital, when they need treatment, when they're sick and when they're hurt. ICE hangs out at the courthouse. They're waiting for people to come to do what they lawfully should be doing and are ordered to do by showing up on criminal cases, family cases, civil cases, cases that are completely not tied to immigration law, ICE agents will often be hanging out in plain clothes at courthouses to pick people up.</p>
                        <p>40:17 Rhiannon: I have been in the position of being a lawyer representing people on criminal charges who are undocumented, and being in a position of having to tell those people what to do because ICE is at the courthouse that day. ICE, they'll raid apartment complexes, they will raid neighborhoods, they'll raid places where immigrants work, they will place families and communities under prolonged targeted surveillance. ICE agents are known for loitering outside homes or outside apartment complexes watching families, and they very commonly, very often use kind of ruses and undercover activity to trick people. They will pose as employers who are looking to hire workers.</p>
                        <p>41:01 Michael: Jesus.</p>
                        <p>41:02 Rhiannon: They will come knock on the door of a family, they will present a photo of somebody who doesn't really exist, they know that the family doesn't know this person. And they'll make up a name knowing that the family will say like, "I don't know this person and this person doesn't live here." But they'll use that to get into the house to say, "Okay, well, if this person that we're looking for doesn't live here then we can come into your house." And then they just arrest the whole family.</p>
                        <p>41:25 Rhiannon: And the way that ICE picks people up, oftentimes, family members, loved ones, they sometimes have no idea where their loved one is. I had a case where I represented a client on a criminal charge, now I don't remember what the criminal charge was, but it was for sure a misdemeanor. And when I was appointed to represent him and when I met him, he was at the county jail after he had just been arrested on the criminal charge, and somehow ICE finds out that he is in jail. All of the sudden, my client and the father in this family is no longer at the jail, and it was like a missing person, nobody can say where this guy is, nobody can say where he's been taken. I went to border patrol stations looking for him, we did not know where this person was until he called his wife the next day from Mexico. It's incredibly violent, it's incredibly pervasive the way they act.</p>
                        <p>42:25 Peter: And look, we mention these because these are tactics designed to create chaos, and so is ICE's interpretation of this law and the government's interpretation of this law. In this case, it is designed to create uncertainty in the minds of immigrants. I was arrested and served time for a minor crime 12 years ago, might I get picked up at any point in the future and indefinitely detained without bond? Maybe. It's something that always weighs on your mind. And there are ways to fight back. You can call up ICE and tell them that you know where an illegal immigrant is, and you give them the location, but right in front of the location, there's a hole and you cover it with sticks and leaves and when they walk over it, they will fall into the hole and now they're trapped.</p>
                        <p>43:16 Rhiannon: Yeah. Lead them to the edge of a cliff, but then in front of the cliff, you put a screen that looks like the road still continues.</p>
                        <p>43:23 Michael: Right, you paint the road.</p>
                        <p>43:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Perfect.</p>
                        <p>43:29 Peter: Alright, the central premise of our podcast is that the courts' decisions are driven by ideology. So don't mistake us. Whatever you think the most reasonable interpretation of this statutory language might be, it's not a coincidence that Sam Alito doesn't give a shit about the lives and well-being of immigrants. His disregard for their dignity is front and center here.</p>
                        <p>43:51 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>43:52 Peter: That's what legal formalism is, it's about creating a network of rules, and when those rules tread on the lives of human beings, you just shrug and point back at the rules as if your hands were tied. If you take the formalistic reasoning away, Alito would still land in the same place because he is an ideologue.</p>
                        <p>44:09 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:10 Peter: But what formalism offers him is a place to hide, it allows him to say that the language of the statute rather than his preferences about how immigrants are treated, compelled him to rule the way that he did. Without it, at the very least, his real motivations would be laid bare. He is at the very least forced to defend the cruelty of his position for what it is. Legal analysis as it exists right now, serves primarily as a shroud over the reality that the practice of law is the manifestation of existing power structures, and that disagreements over laws are actually ideological disagreements about where power should and should not sit. Peeling that away, won't fix the problem of reactionary little cockroaches like Justice Alito but it would shine a light on them, and maybe send them scuttling back into the floor boards where they belong.</p>
                        <p>45:05 Rhiannon: Oh, tell 'em.</p>
                        <p>45:05 Michael: Fuck yeah dude.</p>
                        <p>45:06 Rhiannon: Little extended metaphor for you.</p>
                        <p>45:07 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>45:19 Peter: Alright, next week is Flood v. Kuhn. A case about baseball, labor rights and racism all wrapped up in one.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>45:29 Rhiannon: Perfect.</p>
                        <p>45:32 Peter: And maybe a strong contender for the dumbest Supreme Court opinion of all time.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>00:01 [Archival]: We'll hear argument now on number 99-699, Boy Scouts of America and Monmouth Council versus James Dale.</p>
                        <p>00:13 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon Nayfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Boy Scouts of America v. Dale. This case from 2000 allowed the Boy Scouts organization to discriminate against gay scoutmasters, even though the relevant state law at the time prohibited it.</p>
                        <p>00:31 [Archival]: This case is about whether an organization which includes 50% of the boys in this country from age 7 to 11 has the constitutional right to ignore the civil rights laws of this country.</p>
                        <p>00:45 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>00:56 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have unraveled the fabric of American society, like a nail caught in a sweater. I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy. I am here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:12 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:13 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:14 Rhiannon: Hello, hi.</p>
                        <p>01:16 Peter: Michael, welcome back, by the way.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Rhiannon: Michael's here.</p>
                        <p>01:19 Michael: Thank you. It's good to be back.</p>
                        <p>01:19 Peter: Fresh off a break, mentally acute. Just sharp as hell.</p>
                        <p>01:24 Rhiannon: Ready to go.</p>
                        <p>01:25 Peter: I imagine.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:26 Michael: Yeah, spent the time off honing my intellect.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:31 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>01:31 Peter: Like a blade on a stone, right, just...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:34 Michael: That's right. That's right.</p>
                        <p>01:37 Peter: Today's case is Boy Scouts v. Dale. As we all know, the Boy Scouts are a youth organization for boys that specializes in teaching wilderness and other practical skills. They're distinct from the Girl Scouts who, from what I can tell, are a front for some sort of money laundering operation.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:58 Peter: It's like, "Timmy, you're gonna learn how to make a fire. Sally, you're gonna need to sell as many of these fucking cookies you can."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:07 Rhiannon: Or you're out.</p>
                        <p>02:08 Peter: This is a case from the year 2000 about a Boy Scouts scoutmaster who was forced to sever his ties with the Scouts because he is openly gay. That scoutmaster sued under his state's discrimination laws, but the Supreme Court held in a 5-4 that the Boy Scouts had a constitutional right to sever their ties with gay members under the First Amendment's right to free association.</p>
                        <p>02:34 Rhiannon: Boo.</p>
                        <p>02:36 Peter: We've talked a bit on this podcast about how conservatives use the First Amendment to justify discrimination, and today we're gonna explore the contours of that. And what I really wanna get at is how, no matter how much fancy legal jargon the Court uses to dress it up, the question of whether or not discrimination against gay people or anyone else is protected somehow under the Constitution is entirely a matter of how acceptable the Justices on the Court think discrimination against gays or whoever else actually is.</p>
                        <p>03:05 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>03:06 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>03:07 Peter: This decision is written by then Chief Justice William Rehnquist, joined by the other four conservatives on the Court at the time, Sandra Day O'Connor, Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy. We've noted several times that Rehnquist was a segregationist early in his career, probably late in his career too, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that by the year 2000, he was maybe not the most open-minded towards gays. And to contextualize this culturally a little bit, it's the year 2000, it's a turning point, I think, in the culture war over gay rights.</p>
                        <p>03:42 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:43 Peter: At this point, gay marriage is not widely considered to be on the table, so most of the gay rights culture war took place in back and forth letters to the editor about whether or not Will and Grace deserved a slot on prime-time television.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:00 Peter: I don't know if you guys remember this era, but I do, and it was intolerable. In the courts, though, anti-gay groups were hoping to be found legally exempt from discrimination laws that protected gay people, a strategy that has in recent years actually found a bit of a foothold again.</p>
                        <p>04:16 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:17 Peter: So Rhi, tell us about scoutmaster James Dale.</p>
                        <p>04:22 Rhiannon: Yeah, the story is about a guy named James Dale and honestly, like James, he sounds like a freaking square, you know.</p>
                        <p>04:30 Peter: That's weird, a lame scoutmaster?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:34 Rhiannon: Yeah. I think the theme running through all this, it's like, this is a bunch of dorks in a dork organization, and they're being really dramatic. So Dale is involved in the Boy Scouts organization for most of his life. He enters scouting at the age of eight and officially becomes a boy scout a few years later in 1981. And in the majority opinion here, Dale is described as being an exceptional scout throughout his childhood and adolescence, and at the age of 18, he becomes an Eagle Scout, my understanding is that is meaningful to dorks in the...</p>
                        <p>05:07 Peter: That's the best one.</p>
                        <p>05:08 Rhiannon: Dorky organization. Yes, that's right. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:12 Michael: Top of the dork scale.</p>
                        <p>05:13 Rhiannon: Way to go, James.</p>
                        <p>05:15 Peter: The only thing better than being an Eagle Scout is having a friend.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:21 Rhiannon: Well, you know, that's the point of this organization, right. It's for being a boy and wearing your cute uniform and hanging out with your cool boy friends.</p>
                        <p>05:31 Michael: Yeah, throwing on some culottes.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:33 Rhiannon: Pulling up those socks.</p>
                        <p>05:35 Michael: High socks.</p>
                        <p>05:35 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>05:38 Michael: And having a good time.</p>
                        <p>05:39 Rhiannon: After he becomes an Eagle Scout, about a year later, he applies for adult membership to the Boy Scouts organization and is approved for the position of Assistant Scoutmaster of Troop 73. About the same time, Dale starts his freshman year at Rutgers University, and he becomes the co-president of the Lesbian Gay Alliance on campus, just an affinity group for students. And this would probably be totally cool and there would be no issues and no Supreme Court case, except for the snitch ass local media. In 1990, Dale attended a seminar about the mental health needs of gay and lesbian teenagers, and a local newspaper covering that event interviewed him.</p>
                        <p>06:22 Rhiannon: And he was just like discussing kids needing queer role models, etcetera. The paper ran that interview and included a photo of James Dale, and it identified him as a leader in the on-campus gay and lesbian alliance. So a month later, around late July 1990, Dale gets a letter from local Boy Scout officials informing him that he has been expelled from his position as assistant scoutmaster and they are revoking his membership to Boy Scouts of America. So Dale writes back to ask what reason there is for his expulsion from the organization, and they respond that Boy Scouts, "specifically forbid membership to homosexuals."</p>
                        <p>07:04 Rhiannon: So at the time, like Peter said, New Jersey, which is where this is taking place, New Jersey, had a state law that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. So James Dale filed a complaint under that state law saying he had been illegally expelled from public accommodation based on his sexual orientation, they explicitly said this in the letter, "This is a violation of New Jersey law." So James Dale's complaint goes up to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which agreed with him, they said that the Boy Scouts was an organization of public accommodation rather than just a private entity, and as such, they couldn't discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. And in response to the argument that this violated the Boy Scouts' Freedom of Association, the New Jersey Supreme Court said that while the Boy Scouts do express beliefs and moral values as an organization, the Boy Scouts do not have a shared goal of association in order to promote the view that homosexuality is immoral.</p>
                        <p>08:09 Rhiannon: Just a little note here about the Boy Scouts as an organization and their history, they're not like an explicitly religious organization, religion isn't really in their mission statement. Back in 1910, when the Boy Scouts was founded, their mission statement was "To teach patriotism, courage, self-reliance and kindred values." That's it. Like I said, just dudes rock kind of organization.</p>
                        <p>08:37 Peter: Did Teddy Roosevelt have something to do with this, 'cause it feels very Teddy Roosevelt.</p>
                        <p>08:41 Rhiannon: He was really excited when the Boy Scouts Organization was founded, 'cause he's a dudes rock kind of guy, and so... Yeah, it's in that vein. Today, their mission statement is a little bit different. It is, "To prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout oath and law." They do sort of purport to have a general like what's called a duty to God principle and some sort of by-law that requires that members agree with a declaration of religious principle, but again, there's nothing explicitly as an organization that says like you gotta adhere to specifically like Christian values.</p>
                        <p>09:20 Michael: Right, right. And they were originally explicitly ecumenical?</p>
                        <p>09:25 Rhiannon: What the fuck does that mean, Michael?</p>
                        <p>09:28 Peter: Ecumenical?</p>
                        <p>09:29 Rhiannon: Sorry, I'm a dumb girl, Peter.</p>
                        <p>09:31 Peter: Cross-denominational.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:33 Michael: Yeah, cross-denominational. They don't differentiate between religious faiths.</p>
                        <p>09:37 Rhiannon: Thank you, we can pick up on context clues, but sometimes a girl just wants to interrupt.</p>
                        <p>09:41 Michael: But so they got caught up in the religious right shit in the early '70s, seemingly in response to the birth of the gay rights movement, which started with the Stonewall riots in '69, and this was around the time they cancelled the availability of religious medals for Unitarian Universalists. So I think this story is really not that they're a religious organization and their religion was driving some anti-gay stance, so much as the opposite, their anti-gay attitude drove them into the hands of the religious right for a few decades and it's just sort of now fading.</p>
                        <p>10:16 Rhiannon: And they now allow girls to participate in the Scouts program, which officially is not the Boy Scouts anymore, it's just Scouts, they also allow trans scouts, but side note, they have a major sex abuse scandal, which Boy Scouts of America National has said has bankrupted their organization. So, so much for keeping the gays out, doesn't look like that did you much good on the moral high ground front.</p>
                        <p>10:43 Peter: I wanna flip the implication of the... So much for keeping the gays out, they're obviously wreaking havoc in place.</p>
                        <p>10:52 Rhiannon: No, no, no, that's not what I meant.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:55 Peter: Look. If you can't run an organization where a single adult takes 25 children into the woods for a week at a time without pedophiles getting involved, then what can you do anymore? Look, I was looking into the Scouts a little bit as part of my research here, and if you don't mind, I'd like to take the next three to four hours to talk about merit badges. So I assume most people know that merit badges are awards that Boy Scouts get for completing certain tasks or areas of study. And I looked over all of the badges and I have to say it is completely bizarre. Some of them are for very basic stuff, like there's one for archery and one for fishing. Okay, sure. There's one for bugling, which we were discussing this earlier this week, it's like before trumpets had buttons, that's a bugle.</p>
                        <p>11:49 Rhiannon: Just a dumb horn.</p>
                        <p>11:52 Peter: Yeah, but then also there's one for nuclear science...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:56 Peter: It's like a fucking PhD. What's going on here? And I was also very unsettled to see a crime prevention merit badge.</p>
                        <p>12:04 Rhiannon: Oh, God.</p>
                        <p>12:04 Peter: Yeah. A lot of red flags. Absolutely nothing good can come from teaching these little fucking dorks about crime prevention. This is the George Zimmerman merit badge.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:16 Leon: Oh, no. That's bad.</p>
                        <p>12:20 Peter: And also, I was looking at what you need to do to get the badge. And one of the tasks is to identify the signs of child abuse, and I'm sort of wondering whether this is like the organization outsourcing their child abuse problems to the scouts themselves, they're like, "Okay, kids, let us know if you see any indications of sexual trauma." And the kids are like, "Why?" And they're like, "Oh, it's a merit badge."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:44 Rhiannon: That's what all upstanding citizens do.</p>
                        <p>12:49 Peter: Yeah. Another disturbing one is that there's a merit badge called Indian Lore.</p>
                        <p>12:55 Rhiannon: Oh, God.</p>
                        <p>12:56 Peter: Maybe I'm off base, but it seems a bit odd to use the word "lore" to describe people that still live in this country as if they're mythological creations.</p>
                        <p>13:05 Rhiannon: Right, right, right. We don't need to switch up the genres, just history is fine.</p>
                        <p>13:09 Peter: Like the Indians and Dragons merit badge.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>13:14 Peter: I will tell you one thing the Indian Lore merit badge doesn't require, and that's talking to a Native American.</p>
                        <p>13:23 Rhiannon: Do they have the requirements for each badge?</p>
                        <p>13:25 Peter: Yeah, you can look 'em all up. To be fair, one of 10 or so optional things you can do to get the badge is, "attend a contemporary American Indian gathering." But then it says, "discuss with your counselor what you learned and observed. Include in your discussion any singing, dancing, drumming, and the various men's and women's dance styles you saw."</p>
                        <p>13:47 Rhiannon: No, no, no, no.</p>
                        <p>13:50 Peter: Do they know that native Americans are regular people too? Instead of like, "Make a native American friend and ask them about their culture," they're like, "Attend a powwow."</p>
                        <p>14:02 Michael: Go to a sun dance.</p>
                        <p>14:04 Rhiannon: Exactly. Go around like the Jehovah's Witnesses, knock on a door, they're gonna be dancing inside, take some notes.</p>
                        <p>14:11 Peter: Smoke a peace pipe in a tipi.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:14 Peter: This is the most offensive shit I've ever fucking seen, dude. How's that a merit badge? I will never let my kid go in the fucking Boy Scouts after going through these merit badges. I'm gonna teach my kid about nuclear science myself. Alright.</p>
                        <p>14:27 Rhiannon: Did you guys do Scouts when you were little?</p>
                        <p>14:29 Peter: No.</p>
                        <p>14:30 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>14:31 Peter: This whole case is weird to me because I thought they were all gay.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:38 Rhiannon: You do Boy Scouts when you're little, and then you join the gay and lesbian alliance when you go to college.</p>
                        <p>14:45 Michael: Your progression seems totally natural. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:47 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:51 Peter: Alright, so our producer, Katya, is without this podcast, completely homeless. So in the spirit of supporting her, let's go to an ad.</p>
                        <p>14:58 Peter: Alright, let's talk about the law here. So Dale is simply claiming that he was discriminated against for being gay, which is a violation of New Jersey discrimination laws. The Boy Scouts are claiming that this violates their freedom of association. The First Amendment protects your freedom of speech. And the Court has held in the past that part of that is your freedom to associate with who you want, because some speech is only effective if it's done in conjunction with others. So the Scouts are saying, "Look, our decision not to associate with gays is an expression of our ideals, and that's protected by the First Amendment." And of course, we wouldn't be here if the Court did not side with the Scouts, stating that forcing them to associate with Dale would significantly impact their ability to advocate their viewpoints. So the first thing that jumps out to me about this is just how tenuous the connection between the right to association and any actual speech is.</p>
                        <p>16:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:00 Peter: Like I mentioned, there's no actual literal right to association in the First Amendment. Courts have just held that the right to associate must be protected in order to adequately protect speech. And when you're talking about protecting the rights of people who are organizing for a boycott or a protest, that makes sense, right?</p>
                        <p>16:17 Michael: Or a political party, right, like that's...</p>
                        <p>16:20 Peter: Right. But this is just an organization saying they don't like gays and don't wanna associate with them. That's not the same thing.</p>
                        <p>16:25 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:27 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. And to put the freedom of association into context, the Supreme Court first recognized the right to free association in 1958. The state of Alabama was trying to prevent the NAACP from doing business in the state and had subpoenaed the NAACP's membership list. And back then in that case, the Supreme Court said no, the NAACP members have the right to associate with one another and to do so privately. So the Court was stepping in and saying, look, Alabama is literally trying to shut the NAACP's viewpoint out of their state, that's a textbook violation of the First Amendment.</p>
                        <p>17:02 Peter: Right. And you can contrast that with this, where the Boy Scouts, as an organization, aren't being threatened at all, nor is their ability to speak either publicly or privately. This has no connection to speech or expression, it's just a pure manifestation of the Boy Scouts' desire to discriminate against gays.</p>
                        <p>17:18 Rhiannon: Exactly. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>17:19 Peter: And I think that brings us to the next point, which is that the Boy Scouts are claiming that their anti-gay stance is important to their message. The Boy Scouts isn't about gay stuff. Okay, this is about hyper masculinity, this is about heading into the woods with a dozen other dudes wearing matching uniforms with short shorts and little park ranger hats and perfectly tied neckerchiefs, and doing activities like basket weaving. And if you become good enough at an activity, you get a little award and you put it on your sash...</p>
                        <p>17:52 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>17:53 Peter: Okay.</p>
                        <p>17:53 Rhiannon: Yeah. No gay stuff just... This is about khakis.</p>
                        <p>17:55 Peter: Again, not gay stuff.</p>
                        <p>18:00 Michael: We don't want any sissies.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:04 Peter: So the Boy Scouts are arguing that homosexuality goes against some of their core tenets. Specifically, they require scouts to be "morally straight" and "clean." Justice Stevens points out in his very competent dissent here, what the fuck does that have to do with anything? We know these little straight-laced freaks think that being gay is gross, but like, who cares? Who gives a shit? Why is the Court obligated to humor that at all?</p>
                        <p>18:32 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>18:33 Peter: And that's sort of the fundamental rub here, like the Court is not actually obligated to place any weight at all on an organization's desire to discriminate against gays. Justice Blackmun in his excellent dissent in Bowers v. Hardwick in 1986, a case about the constitutionality of sodomy laws, wrote that, "The mere knowledge that other individuals do not adhere to one's value system cannot be a legally cognizable interest." I think that puts it perfectly. If the Boy Scouts were saying they didn't want to associate with black people, the Court would have tossed their case out in a second. The reason they didn't here is that the conservatives are much, much more comfortable with anti-gay discrimination than they are with racial discrimination. And Rehnquist does this thing that conservatives always do in these cases. He's like, we're not ruling on whether or not homosexuality is wrong, but like, yes, you are. Yes, you are.</p>
                        <p>19:26 Rhiannon: Exactly. Right.</p>
                        <p>19:28 Peter: Because New Jersey passed a law saying you can't discriminate against gays. And the Court is basically saying, well, unless your organization thinks gays are really gross, then you can.</p>
                        <p>19:42 Rhiannon: And Stevens points out in the dissent that the Boy Scouts claim that this is a violation of their central tenets and that that doesn't really seem to make sense. The Scouts themselves instruct scoutmasters not to talk about sexual matters with scouts, sex stuff is not supposed to be part of this organization. So how can it be that their organizational position on certain sexual matters is so important to them that it's protected by the Constitution? The ACLU's brief in this case also points out that the Boy Scouts market themselves to all boys, but here they're clearly contradicting that position.</p>
                        <p>20:18 Peter: Right. And I think sort of like the real bottom line is that Scouts are such a generic organization that their mission can't be summed up as anything other than just a place for boys to learn some life skills, right, they go camping, learn some practical stuff, put that shit on your college resume, and that's that. The claim that somewhere in between canoeing and starting fires, you're supposed to infer that you can only fuck girls. I think that seems like a little tenuous...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:46 Peter: Then again, they're not even a Christian organization, so they can't claim that this is about freedom of religion, which is why this is a big freedom of association, right?</p>
                        <p>20:53 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Peter: And also the Boy Scouts ended up officially letting gays in in 2012, so how central to their mission could it have really been if 12 years after this case, they changed their position entirely?</p>
                        <p>21:06 Rhiannon: Right, this is clearly just about bigots being bigoted, yeah.</p>
                        <p>21:10 Michael: Right. I do wanna dig a little deeper on this idea of their mission, because I think from a gender theory perspective, this all kind of makes sense.</p>
                        <p>21:17 Rhiannon: Come on, Michael, hit us with the gender theory, baby.</p>
                        <p>21:22 Michael: The Boy Scouts are not just about boys playing in the woods, right, it's about this construction of masculinity and about boys growing up to be like capital M, men. Getting all your merit badges and ascending in the ranks and maybe even becoming an Eagle Scout is a literal right of passage through adolescence into adulthood. And so all the things they do, all the things included in the merit badge catalog can be considered acceptable aspects of manhood, whereas things that are excluded could be considered more feminine. Masculinity is defined in opposition to no girls allowed, right, no women, definitely no gays, that sort of thing.</p>
                        <p>22:04 Michael: And Rhi mentioned they were founded in 1910, which was like the tail end of a period of big social upheaval after the Civil War and Southern reconstruction, size and structures of families was changing, there were no more slave servants. The country was urbanizing, men were spending more time at work outside the home, and their wives were taking on a larger role in raising and shaping their sons, and so the Boy Scouts are a social response to that, creating a space for boys to be boys and learn to be men.</p>
                        <p>22:37 Michael: And literally, one of their original documents, which I don't know in the 1910s, how you find workers, maybe you hand out pamphlets on the corner like looking for a job or whatever, but there is this document saying that in scoutmasters, they were looking for, all caps, real live men, red-blooded and right-hearted men, big men. And to be clear, it says, "No Miss Nancy need apply." So they had a very clear ethos.</p>
                        <p>23:07 Rhiannon: They had to say "No Miss Nancy," because big men is not gay at all.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:14 Michael: Right, not clear enough.</p>
                        <p>23:14 Peter: Yeah, no pussies here, we need people who are gonna babysit these 12 children the entire weekend, alright, so you'd better be able to bench press three plates.</p>
                        <p>23:24 Rhiannon: Big juicy men.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:30 Michael: So yeah, look, excluding gay men from the organization, it's like a classic heteronormative institutional approach, right. Essentializing gender, reinforcing gender hierarchies and as an ethos, this is like it isn't really far removed from conversion therapy, right. About molding people into their idea of men and so, yeah, maybe you could get a little sissy boy who's eight and you can turn him into a real man, but we don't need any of those as like scoutmasters. We don't need any of them teaching these kids. So yeah, that doesn't mean they should win, right?</p>
                        <p>24:03 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:03 Michael: Their position is something like, "Boy Scouts, we make men and these fucking sissies aren't real men." The question of whether or not the First Amendment protects them and overrides New Jersey law protecting queer people, I think that's not a hard question, it has to be no, the first Amendment does not protect that.</p>
                        <p>24:22 Peter: I also wanna add, it was mentioned earlier that the Scouts now accept girls and they've become flexible on a bunch of these things, but it was great watching them scramble for a decade there when it was incredibly untenable, like when some girls like, "Why can't I go camping with you?" And they're like, "Ahh, because this is for boys." And that was the end of it.</p>
                        <p>24:44 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>24:46 Peter: There was just like no actual reason for that sort of status quo in this day and age, and watching the discourse on it and watching conservatives get mad. If you ever just feel like getting a conservative angry, just bring up the fact that the Scouts now allow girls and just watch their heads just grow incredibly large until they explode like a tomato.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:09 Peter: So it's important to note, circling back to the law here, that the reasoning used by the Court could essentially just exempt any organization from having to hire or otherwise work with gay people. If an organization that is not religious, has nothing in its mission statement about homosexuality and, in fact, instructs its workers not to talk about sexuality at all, can claim that they need to be exempt from anti-discrimination laws, then anyone can. This is 20 years ago, and it's been sort of a minor miracle that the reasoning employed by the Court here hasn't been used to forge massive loopholes in these laws. On the other hand, Anthony Kennedy, this case aside, was very sympathetic to gay rights and his replacement by Kavanaugh has left the door open for organizations interested in leveraging the First Amendment to facilitate their desire to discriminate against LGBT people moving forward.</p>
                        <p>26:04 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>26:06 Peter: This case is one of many where the analysis done by the Court is what's called a balancing test. The Court is just balancing the interests on both sides, they're weighing them. So they're saying, okay, the state of New Jersey has an interest in wanting to limit discrimination and the Boy Scouts have an interest in wanting to associate with whoever they like. And so which one's more important? Maybe the single central theme of our podcast is that interpretation of the law is generally driven by the preferences of judges rather than some sort of coherence or objective legal framework. That is especially true in these balancing test cases.</p>
                        <p>26:43 Peter: All the court is doing, no matter how much they dress it up, is saying, okay, which of these things is more important. It doesn't get more nakedly ideological than that. So you might be thinking, why can the Boy Scouts do this to gays, but not black people, for example? And yes, some law student might be raising his hand right now, technically they would be applying a different analytical framework if this was race discrimination, but the only reason they apply a different framework is because the Court treats race discrimination as if it's more serious, as if it's worse.</p>
                        <p>27:14 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>27:14 Peter: It's pure policy preference.</p>
                        <p>27:17 Michael: Right, and I think the comparison to racial discrimination is important, and it's a good one. Preparing for this I was reading an article by a friend of the pod, Sam Bagenstos.</p>
                        <p>27:25 Rhiannon: Shout out.</p>
                        <p>27:26 Michael: From 2014, and he sort of situates this case in the long struggle since the Civil War over the breadth of the Civil Rights project, and the ability of the government to intrude on so-called private decisions with right-wing libertarians trying to carve out as big a space for private discrimination as they can. Back in the '50s, for example, someone who owned a diner would argue that it was his private decision about his own business in his own property whether to allow black people to eat there. And one of the big gains of the Civil Rights Movement was to say things like restaurants, clothing stores, railroads and airlines are actually public accommodations, and it doesn't matter if you're a private business owner, if your business is open to the public, then anti-discrimination laws can reach you. And so, like this article's worth reading in general, if you're into reading law review articles, which I imagine not a lot of you are, but...</p>
                        <p>28:20 Peter: I am also not... That's a Michael thing.</p>
                        <p>28:22 Rhiannon: Michael's the only one on the podcast.</p>
                        <p>28:23 Michael: Yeah, that's my role here. The article notes that literally freedom of association was a rallying cry for opponents of desegregation in schools and in public accommodations, and so there's this intellectual through line from Rehnquist himself in the Civil Rights era opposing desegregation to this opinion that he wrote, right, like in 1952, he infamously wrote a memo as a Supreme Court clerk in favor of segregation. I read it. It's shit, but he argues specifically that the Court is ill-suited to police the relationship between individuals and the state. So it's like a very expansive sphere of this private discrimination that the government cannot touch, in his mind. It's hard to read this case and not see that thinking embedded here.</p>
                        <p>29:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>29:14 Michael: And if all this sounds familiar, then it's because Peter, Rhiannon and Leon discussed this last week...</p>
                        <p>29:19 Rhiannon: Doesn't count, 'cause you weren't there.</p>
                        <p>29:20 Michael: Milliken v. Bradley. I wouldn't know, I don't listen to episodes that I'm not on, so, but they must have covered it, I imagine, so.</p>
                        <p>29:31 Rhiannon: Yeah, and to your point, Michael, like this is in a broader conservative trend around conceptions of rights and freedoms to be pulling back on these more expansive views or weaponizing an expansive framework, an expansive view against people, and you see it in more recent Supreme Court cases, like Hobby Lobby, corporations having beliefs that have to be protected, just this past term, the Our Lady of Guadalupe case, which said that anti-discrimination laws don't apply with hiring at religious schools, and in general, the trend in 14th Amendment equal protection jurisprudence. We talked last week already about how the Supreme Court just kind of put a stop on desegregation efforts, and we've talked before on the podcast about how affirmative action jurisprudence under the 14th Amendment is basically used now to protect white people.</p>
                        <p>30:19 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>30:20 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:21 Peter: And we've talked a lot about how through the '50s and '60s, the Court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren made major strides for racial and socioeconomic justice, and how the conservative courts that followed steadily rolled those gains back. This case is part of a separate related phenomenon, where not only do conservative courts roll those gains back, but they take the reasoning of those cases and turn them against marginalized groups. As we mentioned, the freedom of association relied on in this case originated in NAACP v. Alabama, where it was used to protect the NAACP against aggressive racist encroachment by government officials in the South. That same case actually forms a large part of the basis for what is now expansive corporate speech rights. Alabama argued that the First Amendment didn't protect the NAACP because the NAACP is not an individual person, and the Court disagreed. And it has been cited to explain why like fucking AT&T is now the co-sponsor of the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
                        <p>31:32 Rhiannon: [laughter] Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>31:33 Peter: It's not just that conservatives have rolled back rights established in the Warren Court era, in some cases, they have taken those rights, twisted them around and actively used them to protect the interests of the reactionary movement.</p>
                        <p>31:44 Rhiannon: Exactly, and it's such a depressing conception of America and the law to me. This opinion, the Boy Scouts v. Dale, it's not like explicitly originalist opinion or anything like that. Like Peter said, they're just doing a balancing test here and coming out on the side that they like. But just the conservative thought process around the law and what the law is supposed to do, if you look at the 14th Amendment, if you look at the First Amendment, these things are clearly designed to protect people in a way that... I don't know, it's exactly what you said, Peter, it's just so clearly that they don't want the Bill of Rights to mean anything more than protecting freedoms for their own, right, for their small group that already has established hegemony.</p>
                        <p>32:35 Michael: It's like the conception of liberty, where the old adage, I think Lincoln talked about this in one of his addresses, when the shepherd saves the sheep from the wolf, the sheep thank him for protecting them, but the wolf curses him as like tyrannical.</p>
                        <p>32:51 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:52 Michael: Right? And it's like it's the wolf's conception of liberty there, right, where he's being oppressed because he can't go and he can't keep black people out of his diner, he can't keep gay people out of his boys' club.</p>
                        <p>33:04 Rhiannon: Michael, never be gone again, we need you.</p>
                        <p>33:09 Peter: I think it's just especially visceral in this case, 'cause you have the Boy Scouts, they're all fucking wearing these uniforms that are like a perfect blend of The Village People and the SS, and they're sitting there telling you that their institutional position is that they should not have to associate with gay people, citing moral straightness and cleanliness, while at the same time, suppressing via what I assume was various high-powered PR firms, what is undoubtedly one of the largest sexual abuse scandals in American history.</p>
                        <p>33:43 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>33:46 Peter: I sort of wonder whether or not the Scouts at the time when they're fighting this case through the '90s, were just sort of backwards enough to think that gays were part of the problem with the sexual abuse scandal, and sort of not recognizing it for what it was, and using these antiquated ideas about gay men, thinking that we have to keep gays out because we have this huge sexual abuse problem, not realizing that a fucking job where you are isolated with children in the goddamn woods is just like pedophile's fucking gold mine.</p>
                        <p>34:19 Rhiannon: Right, right. It's just, it's scapegoating a minority group that is acceptable for a large part of the population to be discriminated against. And I wanna highlight too the role of the Supreme Court in all of this and in this culture war stuff. We said a couple of times that the Boy Scouts organization now accepts girls, they now accept gay members, they now accept trans members, and that happened because the Boy Scouts organization changed, and it was pretty quick, like within 30 years or whatever. But this Supreme Court case, this precedent, is now law. And so whether the Boy Scouts organization sort of changed for the better, just because social movements and people progress together, we now still have this huge case on the books, and it just shows that the Supreme Court is really slow to respond to social progress, is very rarely going to be driving social progress, if at all, it's just not an institution that's equipped to do that and often actually holds us back.</p>
                        <p>35:19 Michael: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>35:26 Peter: Alright, next week is Nielsen v. Preap, a case about ICE, an organization that we are opposed to.</p>
                        <p>35:36 Rhiannon: It's another fuck the police episode, y'all.</p>
                        <p>35:39 Peter: Follow us @fivefourpod on Twitter. Tell your friends and family. And it seems like we have a little bit of time, so I'm just gonna read off some merit badges as we exit. American business.</p>
                        <p>35:57 Rhiannon: What does that mean?</p>
                        <p>35:58 Peter: I think it's quite clear. Chemistry, Chess, Citizenship in the Nation.</p>
                        <p>36:08 Michael: I like that.</p>
                        <p>36:08 Leon: Coin collecting. Collections, separate. Dentistry.</p>
                        <p>36:19 Rhiannon: It's just like a creepy 12-year-old who's really into teeth. I don't want you getting a badge for that.</p>
                        <p>36:26 Michael: No, thank you.</p>
                        <p>36:30 Peter: Entrepreneurship.</p>
                        <p>36:31 Rhiannon: It sounds like American Business.</p>
                        <p>36:31 Peter: Genealogy. Probably used to be phrenology and they had to change that. Landscape architecture.</p>
                        <p>36:39 Rhiannon: Oh...</p>
                        <p>36:41 Peter: Law.</p>
                        <p>36:42 Michael: Nice.</p>
                        <p>36:42 Peter: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>36:43 Rhiannon: You got a merit badge, guys.</p>
                        <p>36:45 Peter: Well, not yet. Ask five people about the role of law enforcement officers in our society.</p>
                        <p>36:53 Rhiannon: No... Oh, my God, so the law merit badge is fucking cop shit.</p>
                        <p>36:58 Peter: Arrange a visit with a lawyer who works for a business, bank, titled company or government agency. Find out his or her duties and responsibilities and report what you have learned. Why wouldn't they just say any lawyer? Discuss with your counselor the importance in our society of two of the following areas of law: Environmental law, computers and the internet, copyright and the internet. Those are separate. Immigration, patents, biotechnology, privacy law, international law. Famously, the only kinds of law.</p>
                        <p>37:33 Peter: Back to general merit badges. Medicine, Mining in Society, not just mining. Motor Boating. I can do that.</p>
                        <p>37:40 Rhiannon: Shut up. Shut up!</p>

                        <p>00:08 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter and Rhiannon are talking about Milliken v. Bradley, the Supreme Court case from 1974 about school segregation.</p>
                        <p>00:22 [Archival]: Winding up a prolonged and historic term, a divided Supreme Court ruled today on one of the touchiest issues in the nation, busing school children for racial balance.</p>
                        <p>00:31 Leon: In Milliken, the Court found that school districts in the suburbs didn't have to participate in desegregation plans involving city schools, a ruling that kneecapped the cause of integration.</p>
                        <p>00:42 [Archival]: Chief Justice Warren Burger declared for the majority that lower courts acted unconstitutionally by ordering busing between predominantly black Detroit and 53 of its predominantly white suburbs.</p>
                        <p>00:54 Leon: Michael is off this week, but joining Peter and Rhiannon is a special guest. Me, Leon Neyfakh, from Fiasco and Slow Burn. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:12 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have spread like rabies through the American nervous system. I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy. I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:26 Rhiannon: Hi, everyone.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Peter: And our special guest, Leon Neyfakh.</p>
                        <p>01:31 Leon: Hi, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:33 Peter: Leon is, he told me, an expert in racism, and that's why we're having him.</p>
                        <p>01:42 Rhiannon: Peter, you said before on the podcast that you are not a professor of racism.</p>
                        <p>01:46 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>01:46 Rhiannon: But so one of the things that we brought to our listeners today, is a professor of racism, Leon Neyfakh.</p>
                        <p>01:52 Leon: A podcaster of racism.</p>
                        <p>01:54 Peter: Yeah, Michael is taking the week off. Had some personal items to attend to. And also, we keep a strict white male quota on this podcast. That's how it goes. Leon on, Michael off. Sorry, Michael fans.</p>
                        <p>02:12 Rhiannon: Miss you, Michael.</p>
                        <p>02:14 Peter: Today, we are talking about Milliken v. Bradley, a 1974 case about desegregation. This case is in many ways the story of the promise and the failure of school desegregation during the last century.</p>
                        <p>02:26 Leon: Wait, Peter, can I say why I'm actually here?</p>
                        <p>02:29 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:30 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>02:31 Leon: I'm not in fact, a professor racism, lest anyone get the wrong idea. So as you've heard me say, how many times now, 26? How many episodes have we made of 5-4?</p>
                        <p>02:39 Peter: Something like that, yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:40 Leon: As you've heard me say that many times, I am the host of the podcast, Fiasco, which is a history podcast that's available on Luminary, and we tell stories about the recent past, and we've done...</p>
                        <p>02:52 Peter: Alright, let's just wrap this up, Leon.</p>
                        <p>02:54 Leon: Alright, so look, it's a pretty elaborate concept. We make podcasts about history.</p>
                        <p>03:00 Peter: Leon's podcast is about events, if I understand it correctly, things that have happened.</p>
                        <p>03:04 Leon: That's right. And the event that we're covering in our upcoming season, is the desegregation of Boston's public schools, which took place in the mid-70s and is very relevant to the case we're talking about on this episode.</p>
                        <p>03:15 Peter: Alright.</p>
                        <p>03:15 Rhiannon: Yeah, and as part of that season, you interviewed a bunch of people, right?</p>
                        <p>03:19 Leon: Yeah, so it's a narrative documentary, it's a mix of me telling the story, as well as a lot of archival footage from TV coverage and radio coverage at the time, and as you said, dozens of original interviews with people who were there. So in our case, this was key black activists from Boston, who put segregation, school segregation on the agenda in Boston, starting in 1963. And it was because of the pressure they created, that what became known popularly as the Boston Busing Crisis happened in '74, '75, '76.</p>
                        <p>03:51 Peter: Well, hey, welcome to the podcasting game, dude.</p>
                        <p>03:53 Leon: Thank you. Thanks for letting me on.</p>
                        <p>03:58 Peter: Again, the case we're looking at today, is Milliken v. Bradley. In 1974, this case effectively dashed all hopes of ending school segregation in America. But to understand what all of this means, we have to dig into some history. In 1954, the Court in Brown v. Board of Education held that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, but what exactly it meant for states and school districts to desegregate in concrete terms was never entirely clear, and for years, both courts and public officials fought over the obligations of the states to take affirmative actions to remedy the issue.</p>
                        <p>04:35 Peter: At the same time, redlining and other forms of economic discrimination boomed, funneling black Americans into cities, while whites fled to the suburbs. By the 1970s, not only did segregation persist in the South, but that white flight to the suburbs had intensified the separation of black and white communities in the North. So the NAACP took action, filing a lawsuit against the state of Michigan about public school segregation in Detroit, arguing that although segregation was not official government policy in Michigan, various government policies worked to make the region segregated by default. And in Milliken v. Bradley, the Supreme Court rejects this argument, essentially holding that school districts only had to desegregate if there was proof that the segregation was intentional in those districts. In other words, the segregation in Detroit, according to the Court, was coincidental and not a constitutional concern.</p>
                        <p>05:30 Leon: And nobody's fault. The point was that no one did it, no one made a rule that said it had to be like this. This is how it was.</p>
                        <p>05:37 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>05:38 Peter: The opinion is a showcase for just how hollow the promise of equal protection under the law can be when the Court is committed to impeding it. The majority here, written by Chief Justice Warren Burger. We've talked a bit about him in the past, he was the first Chief Justice after Earl Warren. Earl Warren, we've discussed many times, famously moved the Court left, especially on issues of racial justice. Burger on the other hand, a standard-bearer conservative and became a spearhead of the conservative effort to fight back the gains of the Warren Court.</p>
                        <p>06:13 Rhiannon: A quick note about Chief Justice Burger. His own Wikipedia page says that the Chief Justice "did not emerge as a strong intellectual force on the Court." And for Wikipedia to be that fucking shady, means that you were dumb as rocks.</p>
                        <p>06:33 Peter: That's incredible. Wikipedia'd be like, "Look, his guy is a bit of a moron, let's be honest. Not your smartest lawyer, okay." Incredible. You know conservatives are trying to edit that back, but someone at Wikipedia is like, "Absolutely not."</p>
                        <p>06:50 Rhiannon: No, that is accurate and it stays.</p>
                        <p>06:54 Peter: Alright. So a slight change of pace. Rhiannon and Leon, share the burden of telling us some of the background.</p>
                        <p>07:01 Rhiannon: Yeah, it'll be a duet today.</p>
                        <p>07:03 Leon: Beautiful. Four hands, right? Isn't that when you're duetting on a piano, four hands?</p>
                        <p>07:08 Rhiannon: Okay. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:11 Peter: Gonna be a long episode, folks.</p>
                        <p>07:12 Rhiannon: Leon, I told you before this, no nerd shit on 5-4. [chuckle] Alright, folks, so the Fourteenth Amendment, that's what we're talking about today, we talk about her a lot on this podcast 'cause she's messy. And the drama on what the Fourteenth Amendment means in terms of ensuring an equal society on the basis of race. It starts way before Milliken, it starts way before this story, but a good place to start, I think, is with Brown v. Board of Education. Everybody knows this case, and it's one of the most important decisions made by the Supreme Court in US history, it's regarded as one of the best decisions made by the Supreme Court in US history. And like Peter said, it was in 1954, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren ruled in a unanimous decision that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. And they said that, "In the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place." Great, very good, very strong. Thanks, boys.</p>
                        <p>08:21 Rhiannon: But as it turns out, the Brown decision, it didn't say much about how public schools should desegregate and what desegregation would really look like, what states and local governments would really be required to do to desegregate, and that's for a few different reasons, I think. At the time, a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board was seen as a priority. There was a lot of fear that the South would simply refuse to comply with a decision that indicated any sort of debate or ambiguity about what the Constitution said about segregation in public schools. And if the Court ruled that segregation was unconstitutional, but there were a couple of Justices writing in dissent, there was a real fear at the time that the South in particular is insolent enough that it would weaponize any sort of official legal arguments against desegregation and just straight up not follow the ruling.</p>
                        <p>09:13 Leon: That's how that would have worked if it had been a more aggressive ruling, but one that was not unanimous 'cause that's the trade-off. He basically wanted it to be unanimous, and therefore it was perhaps more of a compromise.</p>
                        <p>09:25 Rhiannon: Less strong.</p>
                        <p>09:26 Leon: Yeah. If there had been dissents, how would those dissents have been actually weaponized by legislators or whoever?</p>
                        <p>09:30 Rhiannon: I think it just gives... Peter, you can jump in, but I think it just gives an opening. Today, we talk about decisions where Justices in concurring or dissenting opinions are signaling what type of legal arguments might be convincing or should come up next, that kind of thing. And I think it just allows that legal wiggle room to say, "This isn't 100%, we're not all convinced of this. There's room for interpretation."</p>
                        <p>09:55 Peter: Yeah, and I think you really can't overestimate the extent to which the public institutions of the South were willing to defy the public institutions of the North. And a lot of Southern states viewed the Court with suspicion and the Court's authority over them on these matters with suspicion, and I think there was a fear that the Southern governments would be willing to undermine the legitimacy of the Court by just flat out ignoring a ruling.</p>
                        <p>10:23 Rhiannon: Yeah, we talked about this a little bit in the Terry v. Ohio episode, which is about stop and frisk. But at this time, particularly after Brown v. Board in the mid-50s, late '50s, especially in the South, but across the United States, people are really criticizing the institution of the Supreme Court. There are Impeach Earl Warren campaigns, there's a lot of anger about what's happening. And so that fear is...</p>
                        <p>10:46 Leon: There was a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:48 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. So like we're saying, the legitimacy and the power of the Supreme Court itself was seen as really hanging in the balance. So Chief Justice Warren makes it kind of his mission, really, to get all nine Justices on board with the decision in Brown. That way when it comes out, it's like there's no ifs, ands or buts, segregation in public schools is unconstitutional, period, exclamation point.</p>
                        <p>[foreign language]</p>
                        <p>11:13 Rhiannon: That's it.</p>
                        <p>11:15 Peter: Wait. One comment I wanna make, Rhi, and we've mentioned this before, but I wanna bring it up again while we're talking about Brown v. Board. Brown v. Board was unanimous, but Justice Jackson had a law clerk at the time, young William Rehnquist, future Chief Justice...</p>
                        <p>11:30 Rhiannon: A-ha.</p>
                        <p>11:30 Peter: Who wrote a memo about how Justice Jackson should dissent in Brown v. Board and support upholding separate but equal, the Plessy v. Ferguson doctrine. Plessy v. Ferguson, one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of all time. Rehnquist denied that he actually felt that way, but almost everything we know about that time, about Justice Jackson, about what he said to his fellow clerks, indicates that he was lying and he actually supported maintaining segregation in the South.</p>
                        <p>12:01 Rhiannon: Right, right. And that's important because Rehnquist later is a Justice and later Chief Justice on the Supreme Court, and is involved in Milliken, obviously. So after Brown v. Board is decided, the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren, they know that they aren't giving much direction to the states on how to actually desegregate. In fact, they're deliberately not laying it out what segregated schools need to do to comply with the Constitution. So as the Brown decision comes down, the Supreme Court decides to convene on the same case, Brown v. Board of Education, but in the next year's term, in 1955, so that they can actually issue directives to help implement the Brown ruling. Basically, they want Brown I to come down to announce the principle that segregation is unconstitutional, and then in the next year, they're going to come out with the second Brown v. Board of Education, which will lay out the policy requirements of implementing desegregation.</p>
                        <p>12:58 Peter: Right, let them know what they need to do.</p>
                        <p>12:58 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>12:58 Leon: And that's called Brown II, right? I learned about Brown II when we were researching Fiasco, and I wonder if I'm right to think that most people don't know about Brown II.</p>
                        <p>13:07 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think it's way less known and yes, it's just sort of colloquially known as Brown II.</p>
                        <p>13:11 Leon: I didn't know they could have sequels, I thought that was...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>13:16 Rhiannon: They can do whatever they want, Leon. That's, again, the point of the podcast.</p>
                        <p>13:18 Leon: And it wasn't good, so...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>13:22 Rhiannon: So in Brown II, the holding that the Supreme Court reaches ends up being kind of a mess, frankly, because all they say is that school districts and local governments should desegregate public schools "with all deliberate speed." So you can see how in the Brown II ruling, again, this one is handed down unanimously, the Justices under Chief Justice Earl Warren are trying to do this huge thing that they know is about to blow up something that's so central to the way American society is built, on racial segregation, but at the same time, they're not trying to make anyone super mad about it. So the Brown II ruling just says, "Look, local authorities and district courts below us, y'all are gonna have to use a lot of different tools to get this done to implement the ruling of Brown I. So we're just gonna say it should be done with all deliberate speed, get on it."</p>
                        <p>14:13 Leon: The thing with that phrase, though, is that it sounds like you gotta do it fast, but in fact, the key word is deliberate, and like, "You have to deliberate on how you're gonna do this and do it at that speed."</p>
                        <p>14:22 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>14:23 Peter: It's not like, "do it quickly."</p>
                        <p>14:24 Rhiannon: Right, that's a really good point. And there's no specific direction, there's no specific requirements in the Brown II ruling, there's no tools for what to do, there's no deadlines importantly, nada. So, "with all deliberate speed," whatever that means, the process of desegregation ostensibly sort of gets started, but it's kind of like everyone is on their own to figure out how and to what extent they really are gonna take this on. So...</p>
                        <p>14:48 Leon: And nothing happens basically, right?</p>
                        <p>14:50 Rhiannon: Exactly. Basically nothing happens because, of course, there are politicians and judges and local authority figures all over the country who are publicly and strongly still opposed to desegregation. We know the famous quote by George Wallace, then the Governor of Alabama, "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever." That quote's from 1963, that's nine years after Brown v. Board. He's not saying that being afraid of a Brown v. Board ruling coming down, that's nine years after. So straight up, most of the country, especially the South, they're just not complying with the Brown ruling.</p>
                        <p>15:25 Leon: Is there any truth... Can I ask real quick?</p>
                        <p>15:26 Rhiannon: Of course.</p>
                        <p>15:27 Leon: One of the people we talked to for Fiasco is Justin Driver, who wrote a book about public education and the Supreme Court, and one thing he said was that they didn't wanna make too big of a demand because they thought that if they did, as you said, Southern states just wouldn't do it and that would make the Court look powerless. And I had never thought before about the degree to which the Court is trying to maintain its authority. Is that a common way of seeing what happened with Brown II?</p>
                        <p>15:52 Rhiannon: I think so. I think Brown I and Brown II are seen together and they're seen as a compromised position where the unanimity of the Court was prioritized, so that it could be seen as this strong consensus, but there weren't a lot of strong directives.</p>
                        <p>16:11 Peter: Yeah, the way that Brown and Brown II were taught is that in a lot of ways, the Court was tiptoeing around the South, giving them these generalized ideas, yes, you should desegregate, but very concerned that the South would simply ignore it, and that the Supreme Court would look weak.</p>
                        <p>16:30 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>16:30 Peter: Not just look weak, but prove to have no impact on the state and local governments in the South.</p>
                        <p>16:37 Rhiannon: Yeah, right. And so while the states and local governments are totally dragging their feet, in many places like the Fourth Circuit, even federal judges are helping them do that. They start interpreting the ruling in Brown v. Board just as an order to not segregate, but it's not a mandate to actually integrate. Brown v. Board just stands for the proposition according to these conservative interpretations, that it's just a prohibition on officially saying, "This is a school district in which we segregate based on student race rather than in order to proactively put children of different races in schools together." And one tool a lot of school districts used at the time to do this non-segregation, but also non-integration thing, is so-called freedom of choice plans, where families can just decide which school they send their kids to. So in New Kent County, Virginia, for example, the district there had given black families the option of transferring to a white school and vice versa, but no one did that, of course.</p>
                        <p>17:41 Leon: I think some black kids did, but very few, because they were rightfully afraid of being harassed and terrorized.</p>
                        <p>17:49 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. And the white kids don't go to black schools because they don't want to, because they're racist.</p>
                        <p>17:57 Leon: And 'cause the schools are worse, right?</p>
                        <p>17:58 Rhiannon: And they don't wanna go to worse schools, exactly.</p>
                        <p>17:58 Leon: That's the whole problem, is that the white schools are better.</p>
                        <p>18:00 Rhiannon: Yes, their parents don't want them to go to black schools either. Alright, so let's take a second to get to an ad.</p>
                        <p>18:07 Rhiannon: So in 1968, which like Leon said, is fully 14 years after the ruling in Brown, affirmatively desegregate. You have to do something about de facto segregation on the ground, and you have to do it now.</p>
                        <p>18:22 Leon: Root and branch.</p>
                        <p>18:23 Rhiannon: Root and branch, yes.</p>
                        <p>18:23 Leon: Root and branch.</p>
                        <p>18:25 Rhiannon: Yes. And in a lot of places, that was going to mean busing, busing students of different races to different schools or different districts so that integration was sort of effectuated. Green v. New Kent County, that's another strong ruling from another unanimous court. And then, a few years later, in 1971, the Supreme Court gets even more specific, again, unanimously, in a case called Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg, saying that busing is a constitutionally permissible method to achieve integration. "All things being equal, it might well be desirable to assign pupils to schools nearest their homes," but all things are not equal in a system that has been deliberately constructed and maintained to enforce racial segregation. And so while especially Southern localities and school districts are doing everything they can not to integrate, through the early '70s, the Supreme Court is responding with force and repeatedly saying, "No, you actually have to do this, you actually have to integrate, and there are a lot of tools at your disposal, including busing, so do it."</p>
                        <p>19:30 Leon: And busing had become this incredibly hot issue where politicians would make entire careers off being the most against busing. In Boston, there was a series of local leaders who worked for the school committee, people who were... Who became powerful because they were able to sort of channel the fury of working class whites mostly in the city who didn't want busing, busing became like the code word for desegregation. And one that conveniently takes race out of the equation, "Oh, this is about busing." And one thing that is worth noting is that, the series of decisions that we just went through, people in the North, legislators and officials in the North, didn't really think that these rulings really had anything to do with them. They considered this series of decisions as being about undoing the Jim Crow South, but the reality was that there was segregation all over the North. In Northern cities, there was real segregation, but not because there was a law in the books, right? And for that reason, there is a sense of innocence, right? Like, "Well, the Supreme Court is fixing the South, we're good up here."</p>
                        <p>20:31 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>20:32 Leon: We're not passing a law saying, "No Black People allowed." But that didn't make the segregation any less pernicious, in a way, it made it harder to undo. And so there had been lawyers for the NAACP arguing for a long time that in a lot of these Northern cities like Boston, like Detroit, school administrators and local officials were deliberately keeping white and black kids separate. Instead of doing it overtly by passing laws, they were doing it covertly through more fine-grain policies having to do with approving transfers, when like a family would apply to transfer schools, all these little ways in which they would advance their goal of segregation, but not do so with a blunt instrument, such as a law.</p>
                        <p>21:08 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:09 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:09 Leon: And so it was in 1973 that the Court heard its first case about Northern-style segregation, and that was Keyes v. School District No. 1 in Denver. And so what happened in this case was the Supreme Court found that you didn't need racist laws to sort of enforce segregation, you could do it through other means. It's an interesting case because it takes the distinction between de jure segregation and de facto segregation, and de facto segregation is the kind that comes from where people live, right? You have black neighborhoods and white neighborhoods, then you have community schools that attract people from those neighborhoods.</p>
                        <p>21:44 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:44 Leon: So a place like Denver, the school district there would say, "We don't segregate our children, we just have neighborhood schools." And Boston would say the same thing, "We have neighborhood schools and people who live in those neighborhoods go there, there's nothing pernicious here."</p>
                        <p>21:56 Peter: How dare you accuse working class Boston of racism? How can I be racist when I can't even pronounce the hard R?</p>
                        <p>22:07 Leon: Wow.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:08 Leon: The distinction between de jure and de facto is like, is there a law? And so the decision in Keyes kind of blurred the line between de facto and de jure because it said that you can get real segregation by other means, you don't need a law, and in order for it to be unconstitutional, all you need to show is segregative intent. If there were policies pursued by local school officials that had segregative intent, that's unconstitutional. So on the one hand, it makes this jurisprudence stronger because it blurs the line between de facto and de jure and opens up possibility of finding Northern-style segregation unconstitutional, but at the same time, it holds on to the premise that it needs to be on purpose, at some level, right. Does that make sense?</p>
                        <p>22:48 Rhiannon: Right, yes. And of course, while all of this is going on and happening at the Supreme Court, political forces are mobilizing around race relations and racial equality, and you see that start to have an influence in changing the trajectory of what the Supreme Court had been doing up until that point on desegregation. So importantly, President Nixon takes office in 1969, and he has explicit opposition to busing and expansive integration efforts in his platform.</p>
                        <p>23:17 Peter: Yeah, was he a bit of a racist?</p>
                        <p>23:19 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>23:20 Peter: Not the first president to say the N-word in the Oval Office, but the first to record himself doing it.</p>
                        <p>23:25 Rhiannon: Right, right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>23:26 Leon: Did he really say the N-word on that tape?</p>
                        <p>23:27 Rhiannon: Oh, yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:27 Peter: Leon, I swear to God.</p>
                        <p>23:28 Rhiannon: Come on...</p>
                        <p>23:28 Leon: I should know this, but...</p>
                        <p>23:30 Peter: Yeah, no, the Nixon tapes have just about every racial slur.</p>
                        <p>23:34 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:34 Peter: Name your favorite, it's there.</p>
                        <p>23:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, he runs on openly opposing busing, he gets elected on that and other reactionary political impulses, and meanwhile, there continues to be loud, ongoing public debate about what the ruling in Brown v. Board really meant, and what states need to do to comply, along with continued aggressive, often violent opposition by whites to efforts to integrate.</p>
                        <p>24:00 Peter: Right, and we should note, George Wallace, the segregationist former Governor of Alabama, has a moderately successful Democratic primary campaign in the early '70s...</p>
                        <p>24:10 Rhiannon: For President.</p>
                        <p>24:11 Peter: Yeah, for President. His campaign essentially rejuvenated by the busing crisis.</p>
                        <p>24:16 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>24:16 Leon: We should also note that aside from Richard Nixon, another person who was very anti-busing was Biden. He, in many ways, made it okay for Democrats to be against desegregation, by coming out sort of against busing and saying that integration is good, busing is bad.</p>
                        <p>24:34 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:34 Leon: The problem with that statement is that it's like having Brown v. Board of Education, but none of the shit that followed.</p>
                        <p>24:39 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>24:39 Leon: You stand for the principle, but you're against the one way that we have to actually bring this about now.</p>
                        <p>24:45 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I think that's exactly what sort of Milliken represents in the line of this kind of Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence. So all of this is happening, and finally, we get to Milliken. The case, like Peter said up top, it comes out of Detroit, where the NAACP in 1970 sued Michigan officials for enacting policies that kept Detroit and surrounding schools functionally segregated even though segregation wasn't the official policy. And the case went to trial, and the District Court judge there ruled in favor of the NAACP, saying that school officials and the State of Michigan had been implementing segregationist policies sort of by another name, and the judge ordered them to implement a desegregation plan that included busing.</p>
                        <p>25:29 Peter: Yeah, and worth noting, the trial judge was a conservative guy who originally tried to toss the case out and was forced to have a trial by the appellate court, who sent it back to him and said, "No, you have to hear this." And was convinced by the NAACP lawyers that segregation existed in Detroit.</p>
                        <p>25:46 Rhiannon: Right. A lot of evidence presented...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:50 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:50 Rhiannon: Just fucking forgot a word.</p>
                        <p>25:53 Peter: Who has never been before a jury now, huh?</p>
                        <p>25:56 Peter: Well, I was gonna say, admitted, 'cause I'm thinking about admitting evidence. The school officials obviously appealed that ruling, and by the time Milliken has made its way to the Supreme Court in 1973, the scumbag Nixon has already gotten to nominate a few Justices to the Supreme Court. So, this is really important that Justices Harlan, who was an Eisenhower appointee, and Black, who was appointed by FDR, they're now no longer on the Supreme Court, and when Milliken is before the Court, Nixon has nominated Justice Powell, who is a lifelong conservative, and our boy William Rehnquist, literally a segregationist who wrote a memo in opposition to the ruling in Brown versus Board of Education.</p>
                        <p>26:45 Peter: So, like Rhi said, the lower court finds and after a trial that the Detroit Board of Education, as well as the state itself, had engaged in and sanctioned discriminatory policies that perpetuated segregation. The Court orders the state to implement a desegregation plan, and it's important to note that while the case was not brought against the wider suburban school districts themselves, the Court ordered the defendants to implement a desegregation plan that included those districts. A big part of that plan is busing, busing children from predominantly black areas to predominantly white schools, vice versa. So, the Supreme Court holds that because the only proven purposeful discrimination was within Detroit proper, the suburban school districts could not be held responsible and thus could not be part of any solution to the problem. Basically saying, the ruling would be unfair to those suburban school districts.</p>
                        <p>27:42 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>27:43 Leon: Yeah, and it's like the reason that's a legally relevant point would be if you're saying that only de jure segregation, the kind that is on purpose and enshrined in law, or at least in policy, is the kind of segregation that is deserving of a remedy.</p>
                        <p>27:58 Peter: Yeah, so the Court's reasoning is resting on this distinction between purposeful and coincidental segregation, so the Court is saying, yes, these suburban school districts are segregated, but that's just a coincidence. And this reasoning, it's fundamentally contradictory. What the Court is saying is, yes, Detroit proper has segregated schools because of intentional discrimination, but the suburban school districts are innocent, which deeply misconstrues how segregation actually works.</p>
                        <p>28:29 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>28:29 Peter: The entire purpose of segregation is to produce segregated white school districts. So even if those districts aren't involved in the planning of it, they are the direct output of a process that is designed from the ground up to effect segregation. So, to argue that they are somehow detached from the segregation itself is absurd, they are the purpose of and the end product of the segregation project.</p>
                        <p>28:54 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:56 Leon: Right. And the reason it's constitutional, right, is that no one person made it that way, but everyone made it that way, the reason these suburban schools are all white is that all these white people moved away to the suburbs where, incidentally, black people have a hard time getting rentals and leases. This idea of innocence, we've said that that's the subject of the season of Fiasco, it's like you can't view the suburbs of Detroit as being innocent of racial discrimination. The housing discrimination, both public and private, made it so those Detroit suburbs would exclude black people, and therefore the schools there would exclude black kids, to bring up Justin Driver again, who I mentioned earlier. As Driver put it to me, viewing public schools in hermetic isolation from the housing market is nonsensical, and I think that's exactly right.</p>
                        <p>29:37 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. This is happening at the same time as redlining and economic discrimination against black people is happening, there's rampant racial discrimination in housing, like you said, including literally exclusionary clauses in property deeds that exclude black people from coming into ownership of property. And then, of course, there's straight up actual literal violence against black people who try to move to white neighborhoods. Arson, vandalism, literal assault. All of it.</p>
                        <p>30:06 Leon: There was an insane bombing, a bunch of school buses got blown up just by the KKK in Pontiac, which was outside Detroit. Real terrorism. Can you imagine that?</p>
                        <p>30:15 Peter: Well, they're true believers in the Constitution. If you really get in their mind, you know? It's also important to note that it's inaccurate to treat school districts as being independent. So Justice Burger often refers to school districts as autonomous and leverages that to get where he wants to go, but it's a completely false premise. School districts in Michigan, like just about everywhere else, are controlled by the state. So to say that some are guilty of purposefully implementing segregation while others are not is missing the point; all of those districts are functionally controlled by the state of Michigan. The state is implementing or reinforcing segregationist policies through the school districts. That's why the NAACP sued Michigan itself.</p>
                        <p>31:00 Leon: The whole state as opposed to a school district. Right.</p>
                        <p>31:03 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>31:05 Peter: So, some districts may be more directly involved than others, but they are all part of the state's segregationist scheme, which means that they should all be part of any meaningful solution.</p>
                        <p>31:13 Leon: And the reason they had to do it this way, there weren't white students in the Detroit school system.</p>
                        <p>31:18 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>31:19 Leon: They were gone, they had moved away, and so if you wanted to desegregate those schools like...</p>
                        <p>31:23 Peter: Right. Without including these suburban school districts, there's no adequate remedy here.</p>
                        <p>31:28 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>31:29 Peter: If Metro Detroit has schools that are 80% black, how can they desegregate on their own? How can Detroit reduce the unconstitutional concentration of black students without either subtracting black students or adding white students. If a district is 80% black, it doesn't matter how many different ways you try to reshuffle the students, it'll never be desegregated. It is a solution that is designed and destined to fail.</p>
                        <p>31:53 Leon: Yeah, and just to jump in with a connection to Boston. In Boston, there was a complaint about the busing plan, which said, why are you taking these black kids from this poor black neighborhood and moving them from this poor school into a school in a poor white neighborhood, it's just as poor and just as shitty. What is gained by taking poor white kids and poor black kids and mixing them together, if the schools they all go to suck. Milliken have made it so that kids in Boston wouldn't be bused to schools in suburbs like Brookline or Wellesley. Those were neighborhoods where white people lived and where the public schools were better and better funded because of property taxes. If you had taken kids from Roxbury and bused them into Wellesley or whatever, or Brookline, that would have been a real change for those kids, but they were instead sent to Southie.</p>
                        <p>32:44 Peter: I wanna cut in, because that does increase their chance of becoming a Good Will Hunting. That's my understanding.</p>
                        <p>32:50 Leon: And I think the reason Milliken was so scary to suburban parents is that leaving the suburbs was their way out of being involved in integration. And suddenly their kids whom they intended to send to their nice suburban school, were gonna be sent to this scary school in a scary neighborhood. It just played to all kinds of fears that plenty of people had who didn't want to admit to being motivated by racism.</p>
                        <p>33:13 Peter: Right. It's not about racism, it's about not wanting my kid to interact with black children. And look, the whole goal of desegregation from the perspective of a lot of scholars was, "Look, if you expose white students, especially wealthier white students, to these schools for long enough, political pressure to improve those schools will develop."</p>
                        <p>33:36 Leon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>33:39 Peter: "And over time, those schools will become better and better." Obviously, in the short term, that's not gonna happen. If your kid's getting bused to some shitty school for the next two years or whatever, before he graduates middle school or high school or whatever, that school is not gonna get drastically better in that time period. All that to say, certainly white families had some legitimate concerns about the education that their child might be receiving. But, in case you think that the reaction in Michigan to the prospect of desegregation was motivated by something other than racism, earlier, we noted that segregationist George Wallace ran for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency, lost to George McGovern, he won Michigan. The Governor of Alabama, with basically no sway outside of the South, managed to miraculously win in Michigan the very same year. Also worth noting, just to make you feel better, he was also, the day before the primary, shot and paralyzed for the rest of his life, back when people were taking direct action. Bad politicians got shot back then and yes, some good ones or like okay ones got shot too, but look, if 10 politicians are getting shot and one of them is George Wallace, I'm sorry but that's a win.</p>
                        <p>35:05 Peter: I think we've covered a lot of great ground here and we should pause for an ad.</p>
                        <p>35:09 Peter: So, back to the law and the opinion here. Justice Burger is talking, like we mentioned, about the scope of the remedy needing to be tailored to the scope of the problem. He's saying, "If the real problem is segregation in Detroit itself, suburban school districts outside of Detroit shouldn't be part of the solution." And what that really means is he thinks it's too much of a burden for white families to have to deal with their kids being bused to more black schools. We've talked a bit in the past about the hollowness of the conservative formalistic view of rights. Burger is saying, "Sure, there's segregation here, but that doesn't mean you can bus kids all over the place to solve it." He's saying there's a violation of a right, but he's unwilling to provide a remedy that can actually solve the problem because he thinks that would be too much of a bother to suburban families.</p>
                        <p>35:55 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>35:56 Leon: It would be a punishment for them. Right?</p>
                        <p>36:00 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:00 Leon: The premise of that argument is that having black kids come to your school, if you're a high school kid in a white suburban neighborhood is a punishment and it gives it away that this is about not wanting those people here.</p>
                        <p>36:11 Peter: We've said this before in so many words, but if your children have the constitutional right to attend non-segregated schools, but the government refuses to use its power to provide them the opportunity to do so, then what does it even mean to have that right?</p>
                        <p>36:25 Rhiannon: Right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>36:26 Peter: And I want to add something about this that goes beyond the legal analysis here, which is the sort of conservative unwillingness to believe in the idea that justice might involve any type of collective sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>36:41 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>36:41 Peter: Any type of personal sacrifice that is designed to help someone other than you. They fundamentally disagree that that is important, and they believe that you shouldn't have to do it, and the reason they believe that is because their status in society is generally secure. And that bleeds into this reasoning so much that it just needs to be mentioned. And I think that this all gets to what the role of the Court in American society is. There's a long history in this country of the Supreme Court identifying rights but being unable to protect them. Roe v. Wade, another example, the right to an abortion technically exists per the Supreme Court, but in practice it's extremely weak, and if it's the experience of the Court, that time and time again, the rights that it identifies are ignored by other branches of government and other institutions, that should obligate the Court itself to take affirmative steps to protect those rights. And that's why the Court's refusal to step in and create a remedy here is such a deep and profound failure, not just of policy, but of the way in which we should conceptualize the role of the Court in American government.</p>
                        <p>37:50 Leon: And it's worth underscoring that Milliken follows this string of decisions that all had steadily gradually closed loopholes for states that didn't want to abide by Brown v. Board. There was a tightening of the standard that made it impossible for these states to continue wiggling out of their obligations. And then Milliken follows and it just creates this massive loophole in the place of all the other ones that the Court had been closing over the course of more than a decade, which is that you can just move to the suburbs and not have to worry about any of this and not have to apologize for your kid going to an all-white school, so like you can just do that. And then the entire project of desegregation is thereby undermined.</p>
                        <p>38:28 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly, and I think I wanna highlight the role of the Supreme Court, I guess, in all of this. The reason why Brown versus Board of Education is taught as so important is that it really is not just a watershed moment in the American experiment, broadly, but really specifically in law, and a huge opportunity and new conception of the Fourteenth Amendment and how we use the law and what we think the law is for. Right after Brown and in the couple of cases that we talked about that followed, it's clear that the kind of legal philosophy of the Fourteenth Amendment is that the Fourteenth Amendment is aimed at anti-subordination, and scholars have written about this, but anti-subordination sort of means like a broad conception of equal rights and that the guarantee of equal citizenship in the Fourteenth Amendment, that can't be realized under conditions of really intensive social stratification. So the law is the tool, the law should reform institutions and norms like public schools that enforce subordinate social classes. But on the other hand, what conservatives do, what Peter just talked about, is read Brown v. Board and read the Fourteenth Amendment, and read the role of law and what we have law for completely differently.</p>
                        <p>39:49 Rhiannon: It's something that's sort of more like an anti-classification thing. The kind of narrow conception of the Fourteenth Amendment, that what the Fourteenth Amendment with the Constitution does, it just protects us against the government classifying people based on race, but that's it. So as long as you don't have this de jure, as long as you don't have a law that says that some people are black and some people are white, conservatives are fine with that, and the law doesn't need to be effectuating any other progressive change in society.</p>
                        <p>40:16 Leon: Yeah, what's weird to me is that... It's not like conservatives are denouncing Brown v. Board, right? Everyone's on board with Brown v. Board at this point. And...</p>
                        <p>40:26 Peter: Well, now they are.</p>
                        <p>40:27 Leon: Well, I'm saying like...</p>
                        <p>40:29 Peter: Look, the whole conservative project is just like 20 years later, you pretend you didn't support whatever the mainstream conservative position was 20 years ago.</p>
                        <p>40:34 Leon: But even if it's like... Okay, let's say you... Say that you support Brown v. Board, how can you then not look around today all these years later and see that we have segregation in schools in every major city, more than just every major city?</p>
                        <p>40:47 Rhiannon: But not by law, right? And they read Brown v. Board on purpose to mean... They interpret it that way on purpose, to say, "Because Brown v. Board was not substantively thought out, because there weren't directives in it, because the Court didn't want to step on people's toes," right? But what Brown v. Board just says is, segregation is unconstitutional, and so the way conservatives interpret it is, "Okay, well, then there's no legal segregation, nobody says you have to segregate schools anymore, so we're good. We love Brown v. Board."</p>
                        <p>41:16 Leon: But presumably there's a reason why you don't want it to be in the law. What does the conservative who holds that position you just described say is the reason why we don't want there to be segregative law? Isn't it the premise that segregation is bad and to be avoided?</p>
                        <p>41:25 Peter: No... I mean, yes, that is the premise, but I think that the fact that they defended it at the time, the reactionary movement was defensive of the Plessy v. Ferguson jurisprudence, it shows that they evolved with society and as society rejected that form of explicit segregation, they evolved the tactics they use to maintain social and political power. I don't think it's much more complicated than that. I mean, you'd have to be an absolute psychopath to look at America and not see segregation. If you've traveled across the industrialized world, have you seen pockets of urban decay anything like what you see in America? Anywhere?</p>
                        <p>42:10 Rhiannon: No.</p>
                        <p>42:11 Peter: Rhi, you used the term the American experiment a little bit tongue in cheek, a few minutes ago.</p>
                        <p>42:13 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>42:17 Peter: It always cracks me up that people use that term, like they think we're so fucking interesting. Like we're not like 38th in every meaningful metric...</p>
                        <p>42:22 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>42:22 Peter: Of like how you measure a society. Of course they see segregation, they justified it then with the idea of express white supremacy, and they justify it now with a nod and a wink. What do they talk about like, "Oh, black family values" and shit like that.</p>
                        <p>42:38 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>42:38 Peter: I think it's important as we wrap up to contextualize this as part of a broader conservative conception of social hierarchy. As we mentioned, Burger's argument here is deeply rooted in the idea that the white people in the suburbs are not responsible for the plight of black people in the so-called inner city, and that may be true of some white people in a vacuum, but it ignores the fact that they are beneficiaries of an unjust system, and that removing that benefit is not unfair. It's inherently fair. The decision in Milliken needs to be contextualized within this broader trend of the privileged classes acting as if they can wash their hands of the systems that operate to their benefit. Much of the conservative political project is informed by the idea that social hierarchies are both naturally occurring and inherently just. A lot of like hackish, like Jordan Peterson made his bones in large part on arguments like this, and you can't properly read Burger's reasoning without keeping that in mind. Not only are the white suburbs in his mind innocent of having any ill intent, but they've actually earned their privileged position.</p>
                        <p>43:47 Leon: You see this in the Trump tweet from this past week. What was it, like the suburban lifestyle, right?</p>
                        <p>43:53 Rhiannon: Yeah, right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:55 Leon: People were making fun of that phrase, like he was inventing a phrase, which I think he was, but there's a reason he chose that word, which is that I think that worldview holds the suburbs as like a place to aspire to, confers the status of achievement and stability, right? And...</p>
                        <p>44:07 Rhiannon: And it's a dog whistle for whiteness.</p>
                        <p>44:10 Leon: Yeah, no, of course.</p>
                        <p>44:11 Peter: Of course it is. What other benefit do the suburbs have?</p>
                        <p>44:12 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. It's just that this is a white community.</p>
                        <p>44:15 Peter: I would love to have to drive 15 minutes to a grocery store.</p>
                        <p>44:17 Rhiannon: Right. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>44:19 Peter: Look, it's why conservatives oppose welfare benefits, it's why even in the 1970s, they were sort of implying that explicit racism is more of an issue of the past than the present, when we look back at that era and we see explicit racism all over the place.</p>
                        <p>44:34 Leon: Or the South as opposed to the North, right?</p>
                        <p>44:37 Peter: Right, right. Their worldview is defined by the idea that people's socio-economic status is deserved, and so while they can't say it too explicitly anymore, their sincere belief is that the relative position of the black community in this country is the black community's own fault and the relative position of the white community is due to the white community's inherent virtues. And of course, that ignores the willful public and private practices that drove whites to the suburbs and blacks to the so-called inner city in the middle of the last century. But that is the belief that informs Justice Burger's opinion, not some convoluted analysis of the scope of a constitutional remedy.</p>
                        <p>45:17 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>45:23 Peter: Alright, next week is Boy Scouts v. Dale case about whether the Boy Scouts are allowed to discriminate against gays under the First Amendment. Michael will be back, almost certainly. It's a near guarantee.</p>
                        <p>45:37 Rhiannon: Thank God.</p>
                        <p>45:37 Peter: And another promise, no Leon. [laughter] Leon, thanks for joining.</p>
                        <p>45:43 Rhiannon: Thanks, Leon.</p>

                        <p>00:03 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone. This is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are taking a break from history. Instead, they're talking about the present.</p>
                        <p>00:15 [Archival]: It was the first abortion case decided with President Trump appointees on the court.</p>
                        <p>00:19 [Archival]: A decision coming in on DACA.</p>
                        <p>00:21 [Archival]: Roberts wrote the opinion, and it was John Roberts and the four Liberals, and the opinion is, it's a joke.</p>
                        <p>00:28 Leon Neyfakh: What happened during the Supreme Court session that just wrapped up, and how it differs from what a lot of people think?</p>
                        <p>00:34 [Archival]: So we have another decision from a conservative Supreme Court with an outcome that would please the democrats and the Liberals.</p>
                        <p>00:42 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>00:53 Peter: Welcome to 5-4 where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have burned through American life like hot lava through the streets of Pompeii.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:04 Peter: I am Peter. Twitter is @The_Law_Boy. I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:09 Rhiannon: Hey. Hi everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:11 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:12 Michael: Hello.</p>
                        <p>01:13 Peter: And today, we wanted to take a step back and reflect on the Supreme Court term that ended a few weeks ago. We took a week off last week to give thanks for the term that was and also because I was moving, and now I'm there, in a new closet surrounded by pillows and blankets, and all the things that my producer makes me put inside my closet.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:37 Rhiannon: Mo' money, mo' problems.</p>
                        <p>01:39 Peter: That's right. The incredible wealth that we've derived from this podcast is not without sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:49 Rhiannon: Guys, can you imagine doing this podcast and it being economically worth it?</p>
                        <p>01:53 Michael: I cannot.</p>
                        <p>01:55 Peter: I truly can't.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:56 Rhiannon: Wouldn't that be so fucking cool, though?</p>
                        <p>01:58 Michael: It would be fantastic.</p>
                        <p>02:00 Peter: Before we talk about what actually happened to this term, we should talk about what people seem to think happened this term. And what people seem to think happened is that Chief Justice John Roberts established himself as a moderate voice on the Supreme Court. He joined the Liberals in a handful of close cases, especially towards the end of the term, and that gave a lot of observers the impression that he's gravitating left. But any close analysis of those cases shows that his opinions are intentionally cagey and designed to give Liberals a short-term win, while paving the way for Conservative victories down the road. So Roberts has changed his voting strategy, but he remains deeply committed to the conservative political project, and you really couldn't tell that if you were just reading the legal journalistic media. Right?</p>
                        <p>02:58 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>03:00 Peter: He's been receiving heaps of praise from moderate and liberal journalists and pundits, and I think we should talk about some of that media coverage, and Rhiannon, you read through some of it, so...</p>
                        <p>03:10 Rhiannon: I unfortunately did, and I'm here to report that it is a pile of smelly garbage.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>03:17 Michael: It is.</p>
                        <p>03:18 Rhiannon: Do legal analysts have some sort of duty to say, "Gotta hand it to the Chief Justice," just like every fucking term? Can they just say for once that shit fucking sucks? This is why cancel culture, it's not real. If cancel culture was real, we wouldn't be here right now having to tell you that actually Chief Justice John Roberts is a little bitch, and he's not good at his job. But yeah, let's go through some of this ridiculous media rundown over the past couple of weeks, commenting on the end of the Supreme Court term. So Jeffrey Rosen wrote in a piece called "John Roberts is just who the Supreme Court needed." He writes that, "At a time of greater partisan conflict between the President and Congress than any time since the Civil War, as Americans are questioning the legitimacy of all three branches of the Federal Government, Roberts worked to ensure that the Supreme Court can be embraced by citizens of different perspectives as a neutral arbiter guided by law rather than politics."</p>
                        <p>04:26 Michael: Wrong.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:29 Rhiannon: Adam Liptak, in the Times, he's on a John Roberts' dick sucking marathon. He can't stop. "In an era of stark partisan polarization, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr... " Thanks for the full name.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:43 Peter: Very uncomfortable when you write it out.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>04:46 Peter: Like it's an honorific or whatever, very weird.</p>
                        <p>04:50 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:50 Rhiannon: John Roberts steered the Supreme Court toward the middle, doling out victories to both left and right in the most consequential term in recent memory. Then he quotes a Professor Lee Epstein as saying, "The trend is clear, he is drifting left at a statistically significant rate and at a rate roughly resembling Souter's liberal turn in the 1990s."</p>
                        <p>05:12 Peter: No.</p>
                        <p>05:12 Michael: Wrong.</p>
                        <p>05:12 Peter: No.</p>
                        <p>05:14 Rhiannon: That's fucking embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>05:15 Michael: Wrong.</p>
                        <p>05:16 Peter: If you ever see any statistical analysis of Supreme Court decisions that tries to place them on a political spectrum, you can immediately move on. It's so difficult to do. You can't clearly delineate between left and right decisions. It's more complicated than that. And anyone who's trying to do it and selling it to you as an explanation of the Supreme Court is a grifter.</p>
                        <p>05:43 Rhiannon: Yes, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>05:44 Michael: Yeah. That's right.</p>
                        <p>05:45 Rhiannon: Alright, well, but this completely un-earned praise for the Chief Justice is not just an East Coast disease. So David Savage in the LA Times wrote, "As he has done in previous years, Roberts showed again that he is masterful at finding the middle ground on contentious issues." Later, Savage says, The Supreme Court term took on "A dramatically different tone than conservatives or many others expected with Chief Justice John G. Roberts firmly in control and steering the court on a middle course." Why? You do not have to act like something is cool and novel and surprising, if it just isn't. Like, can somebody check on these people's brains?</p>
                        <p>06:31 Michael: It's not hard 'cause they're, like, dripping out of their nose...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:34 Michael: And pooling on the floor.</p>
                        <p>06:35 Rhiannon: And they're writing their thoughts! Their writings are a perfect check-in with their brain.</p>
                        <p>06:39 Peter: I'm also upset that these people just get to go to the LA Times, the NY Times, the Atlantic, and just pitch their shitty idea. "What if we said that John Roberts is good now," and it's the same column you see in every newspaper across the country, and the editors are like, "Yeah, yeah."</p>
                        <p>07:03 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's what we pay you $200,000 a year for. Do it.</p>
                        <p>07:06 Peter: It's also even creepier to be just a law professor who's like, "You know what the world needs to hear is an op-ed saying John Roberts is doing good."</p>
                        <p>07:17 Rhiannon: Yeah, okay, I got one of those for you. Jonathan Adler, who is a law professor at some garbage law school, which...</p>
                        <p>07:23 Michael: He sucks.</p>
                        <p>07:24 Rhiannon: They're all garbage. He said in an op-ed in the New York Times that Roberts is, "A judicial minimalist."</p>
                        <p>07:32 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>07:32 Rhiannon: "A judicial minimalist who seeks to avoid sweeping decisions with disruptive effects. If a litigant seeks an outcome that will transform the law or produce significant practical effects, Roberts' vote will be harder to get." Guys... My soul has left my body. A minimalist where?</p>
                        <p>07:51 Peter: It's not minimalism. I don't know what he thinks minimalism is. I think that someone who dismantled the Voting Rights Act is not a minimalist.</p>
                        <p>08:02 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>08:02 Peter: That's not minimalism. He's a minimalist when the alternative is something that he feels as politically untenable. Sure.</p>
                        <p>08:10 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>08:11 Peter: Where he feels it's advantageous, he's minimalistic, when it's not, he's maximalistic. That doesn't make him a minimalist. That makes him an opportunist.</p>
                        <p>08:19 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>08:19 Michael: Right. And so Rhiannon, you were asking where the shit comes from, why these people do it. And I just... I think of it like in ancient Greece, there was the fucking Oracle at Delphi, right?</p>
                        <p>08:30 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:31 Michael: Who would just pronounce nonsense. And then there were like these priestesses, the prophetae, who would interpret the nonsense and turn it into something coherent. And that's basically law professors and legal journalists. The Supreme Court just says whatever the fuck they want, they say they're following precedent when they're not, and they say they're respecting the lower courts fact finding when they're not...</p>
                        <p>08:58 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:00 Michael: These people's job is to be like, "Actually, they are. Money is speech. That makes sense."</p>
                        <p>09:04 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:04 Michael: "And this is an overturning Roe v. Wade, it's just interpreting it." And it's because their entire job, you know, relies on it. Like if you're fucking priest of the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court's garbage, nobody has any use for you.</p>
                        <p>09:19 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>09:19 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>09:19 Michael: And look, just as an example, if you're like a prof at, like, UC Hastings. Even if you graduated from Yale, if you're a young prof likely you did graduate from Yale or Harvard, you went and clerked at the Supreme Court. None of your students have that career path ahead. Like that's just not something that's on offer for them, and you don't have anything meaningful to teach them about the law as they'll be practicing it in their careers. Because they don't know shit about what a real estate post-closing looks like, or how to get a default judgement vacated in some county court or whatever. Which is what most of their students will be doing. Their value to the students and to the academia in general is their interpretation of the federal courts. The Supreme Court in particular, but also the Courts of Appeals. And if the courts are just ideological law makers pursuing their own agendas, that value is next to nothing.</p>
                        <p>10:17 Peter: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>10:17 Rhiannon: Yeah. Really good point.</p>
                        <p>10:18 Peter: We should note that not all academics have been so blinkered in their analysis here. Leah Littman wrote a great article for the Atlantic, I think she had one in the Washington Post, about just how narrow the so-called Roberts wins were. Eric Segall wrote about just how dangerous some of the precedent created this year was. But I wanna note that writing articles about how a Supreme Court Justice seems good and smart, even if it's accurate, is a type of journalism that is just fundamentally unimportant.</p>
                        <p>10:47 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:48 Michael: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>10:48 Peter: It doesn't ask anything of the powerful, it doesn't challenge its readers, it is produced by and for the brains of people who are on mental cruise control from birth until death.</p>
                        <p>11:00 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>11:00 Peter: Like the intellectual fruit of completely frictionless lives. I know the things seem bad, but what if I told you that it's actually okay? Like, "Don't worry, John Roberts is there for you."</p>
                        <p>11:10 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>11:10 Peter: It's these people that are selling comforting lies to people who are not effected by any of the turmoil in this country or in this world, right. They just need reassurance that their apathy is acceptable.</p>
                        <p>11:24 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:25 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:25 Peter: But if you're a professor and that's your takeaway, you shouldn't have a job. And this is just what happens with like 20 years of... Your entire job being, write two articles a year, give kids the same test two semesters in a row, take a month and a half to grade it, and that's it.</p>
                        <p>11:45 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>11:45 Peter: Other than that, you just fucking blow smoke up your friend's asses at cocktail parties. And that's it.</p>
                        <p>11:50 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:50 Peter: These people are not interacting with the world in such a way where they could ever actually produce an interesting thought about it.</p>
                        <p>11:58 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:58 Peter: You don't have to fucking pay attention to what they think, 'cause it's so disconnected from reality that it just doesn't fucking matter.</p>
                        <p>12:03 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>12:04 Peter: So the dominant media narrative about John Roberts here runs into two problems. First, the cases he's being praised for aren't nearly the victories a lot of liberals seem to think they are, with the exception of Bostock County, the LGBT rights case that we covered a few episodes ago, each of the cases, and we'll talk about them, are very hollow and fleeting wins for liberals.</p>
                        <p>12:28 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>12:28 Peter: The other issue is that Roberts' votes in other areas are consistently the same horrific reactionary shit we've come to expect from him.</p>
                        <p>12:37 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>12:37 Peter: So first I think it's important to quickly discuss the cases where Roberts supposedly flipped to the liberal side. And again, you know... Maybe the most unequivocal victory where Roberts joined the Majority was Bostock v Clayton county. Again, we did an episode on it, so I don't wanna get into too much detail, but the court held that Federal Employment Discrimination laws apply to LGBT people. And the caveat is that the opinion expressly left the door open for a religious exemption to the law through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The other caveat here is that Roberts didn't even write this one, Gorsuch did. His vote wasn't even necessary, really, to carry a majority, and so giving Roberts credit for it, seems a little bit odd.</p>
                        <p>13:19 Michael: Right, and then in the abortion case, June Medical v. Russo, Roberts joined the liberals in striking down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, and that was five, four, and so he was the deciding vote. But that also has huge caveats. And the big one is that it's the exact case, not like similar, not kind of the same, this law was before the court four years ago. And in that case, Kennedy sided with the Liberals giving them five votes and striking down their restrictions. And so the only reason this case is back in front of the court is because conservative activists were like, "Oh, well fucking Kennedy's gone. He's been replaced by Kavanaugh. And so, yeah, Roberts switched sides, but the reason he did so is because he's just like, "Look, the court just ruled on this. You can't ask me to say, "Yeah, all that really matters is the personnel of the court." We're supposed to at least pretend like this shit matters. He just doesn't wanna look transparently in bad faith. But what happens is, he writes a concurring opinion, which is gonna end up being like what a lot of courts pay attention to, that endorses a standard that actually allows for a lot more restrictive laws without requiring any demonstration that those laws protect the health and safety of women.</p>
                        <p>14:42 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, so the case four years ago that Michael mentioned, that's called Whole Woman's Health, and that case was about restrictive laws that were passed in the state of Texas to force abortion providers to meet these really unrealistic standards. For doctors, to have admitting privileges to area hospitals. In that case, as Michael said, it was struck down, and then this case, June Medical, brought basically the same sorts of laws that Louisiana had passed. So while Chief Justice Roberts... Yeah, he upholds the ruling to strike down the Louisiana law in June Medical, he does it clearly, really begrudgingly. He says, "I joined the dissent in Whole Woman's Health and continue to believe that that case was wrongly decided." And because Roberts makes himself the swing vote here, that means that his concurrence, that's the holding opinion, that's the law of the land, so to speak.</p>
                        <p>15:39 Rhiannon: This is gonna allow states some wiggle room to pass laws that are restrictive. And in addition, something that's really, really concerning for people who are working on reproductive justice and reproductive rights is that Roberts in that concurrence, he straight up signals that he'd be open to overturning Casey, which is a conservative opinion that sort of saved abortion rights, but in an already narrow way. And Roberts here, in this concurrence is basically signaling that he wants to hear argument about Casey. He says, "No party in June Medical has asked us to reassess the Constitutional validity of Casey." Meaning, bring us a case where we can assess the validity of Casey. So again, we don't need to praise this guy for being some big respecter of precedent. Casey is precedent to, and he's signalling to the public, "Hey, I'm willing to rethink it."</p>
                        <p>16:38 Michael: And just to emphasize the importance of Casey, everybody knows the name Roe v. Wade, and think like, "Oh, they're gonna overturn Roe v. Wade. That's the right to abortion and all that." But in reality, the decision that describes that Right and the degree to which it exists, and the degree to which states can restrict it, is Casey. And so if he's willing to revisit it, that means they're willing to rethink entirely the way abortion is regulated or whether or not it's even allowed.</p>
                        <p>17:08 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>17:08 Peter: A couple other small decisions we wanted to mention, Roberts joined the liberals to uphold DACA and to save the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Both of those cases were kind of similar. Roberts joins the liberals, but he provides the Trump administration with a road map for dismantling DACA, and for ending the CFPB. It's barely a win in both of those cases. You also have the Trump subpoena cases, sort of similar, he denied Congress access to Trump's tax records while saying that prosecutors could have them, essentially ensuring that whatever those tax records are, they won't be seen until after the election. It's just embarrassing to see the media buy into the idea that those are wins, frankly. The dominant narrative praises Roberts for two things, his objectivity and his desire to preserve the integrity of the institution of the court.</p>
                        <p>18:06 Peter: But those things are incompatible. You can't be both objective and purposefully shifting your opinions to make the court seem more moderate, right? Almost no legal commentators have pointed out that there is inherent tension between these two things. If Roberts is intentionally trying to land on moderate outcomes in certain politically contentious cases, and I think we all agree that he is, that doesn't prove that the court is apolitical, it shows that Roberts is expressly factoring politics and public opinion into his decisions. This is someone who, in his confirmation hearings, famously described to his judicial philosophy as being a neutral umpire who calls balls and strikes. So it's bizarre to see people praise him for engaging in what we all agree is political decision-making on the court. And it should go without saying that if you admit he's shifting his opinions for political reasons, you need to ask yourself, "To what end?"</p>
                        <p>19:00 Peter: Everyone says he's trying to preserve the institutional legitimacy of the court. What it means is that he's trying to obfuscate just how conservative the court really is and just how much farther right of the general public it is on a huge array of issues.</p>
                        <p>19:13 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>19:13 Peter: And so when someone writes an article praising Roberts for his statesmanship, or whatever, what they're really praising is his ability to project to the public the image of a Supreme court that does not actually exist.</p>
                        <p>19:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's misleading to the public on the part of John Roberts, and it's misleading to the public on the part of journalists and legal analysts who are regurgitating this line over and over for us.</p>
                        <p>19:36 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:36 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>19:37 Peter: All right. Let's put a hold on this and go to a quick ad.</p>
                        <p>0:19:41 Peter: Alright. Let's talk about what actually happened this term. Outside of these handful of cases where he ostensibly took a small step to the left. This term, like any other Roberts court term, was defined by a huge number of reactionary decisions. The most visceral and farthest right, in our view, fall into three basic areas, immigration, religious liberty, and voting rights. So let's talk immigration first.</p>
                        <p>20:08 Rhiannon: Sure. Like we already said, while, we got a DACA win. An opinion that narrowly, again, upholds and protects DACA for dreamers please remember that John Roberts is no friend of immigration rights. We've already done an episode on it. John Roberts is in the majority in Trump v. Hawaii, which of course is not in this term. But Trump v. Hawaii upholds the Muslim ban in this term. He's in the majority in Hernandez v. Mesa. We also did an episode on that. That case is about a border patrol officer shooting a young Mexican teenager across the border. That case isn't expressly about immigration, but it's certainly about the border and border politics and what law enforcement can do in these immigration enforcement zones.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Rhiannon: Like the guy sucks, okay? He sucks on this issue, on immigration. And aside from DACA, there are two other cases this term that were awful for immigrants and asylum seekers in the United States. The first is Barton versus Barr. This case... It's literally too complicated to discuss at any length, but we can just say that this case, Barton v. Barr, creates an additional barrier for green card holders to be eligible for cancellation of removal, and that's one of the few defenses that green card holders have to deportation. And in another case, which was Department of Homeland Security versus Thuraissigiam. In that case... Again, Roberts in the majority saying that asylum seekers are not entitled to getting their case reviewed by a federal court after an asylum officer rejects their initial claim for refuge in the United States.</p>
                        <p>21:46 Rhiannon: Basically, what this means is that when someone reaches the US and wants to be granted asylum, the very first part of that process starts with an asylum officer in what's called a credible fear interview. And if the asylum officer agrees that you have a credible fear of being returned to your country, then you can get your refugee claim reviewed in detail by an immigration court. If the asylum officer does not agree that you have a credible fear, the Supreme Court has said, in this case, that that decision is final and you cannot appeal that to a federal court to review on your behalf.</p>
                        <p>22:22 Michael: And you can imagine what sort of fucking meat heads...</p>
                        <p>22:25 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>22:26 Michael: Are these officials who are deciding whether or not your fear is credible.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>22:32 Peter: Right. Right. So religious freedom, maybe one of the most consistent trends of the Roberts area is the expansion of preferential treatment for religious people and religious institutions. We talked in our Hobby Lobby episode about how the court a few years ago was using the religious freedom restoration act to create a space in which employers could discriminate using religious grounds and Gorsuch's decision on LGBT rights in Bostock hinted at future exemptions to employment discrimination laws for religious employers.</p>
                        <p>23:09 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>23:10 Peter: But there were also two prominent cases that underline just how far right the Roberts court is on so-called religious freedom generally. In Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, the court held that if States give secular private schools financial assistance, they have to provide the same assistance to religious schools. A lot of states have rules against funding religious activity for the purpose of avoiding having the excessive entanglements of the government and a religion, which is of course, the goal of the first amendment. But conservatives have steadily been rejecting that understanding of the first amendment and shifting toward a framework that is in some ways, almost completely inverted, where not only can states fund religious activity, but it's actually mandatory for them to do so.</p>
                        <p>24:00 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:00 Peter: In another case, Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, I think that's how you pronounce it. The court held that anti-discrimination laws do not apply to teachers at religious schools. There's an exception to discrimination laws called the ministerial exception and the idea is simple. Religious institutions like churches are allowed to discriminate on the basis of gender, sex or LGBT status, for example, when they're hiring ministers or priests or some equivalent because they argue those things are essential to their religious practice and they should be allowed to hire representatives of their religion that reflect its values. And that's why it's legal for every Catholic priest to be a male or whatever. But that's always been limited to actual ministers and priests or people in similar positions.</p>
                        <p>24:48 Peter: And this opinion basically says that it applies to anyone employed by religious institutions, opening the door for religious schools and churches to discriminate against their staff even if those staff aren't in positions of any religious authority. So for example, if you are a Catholic school or a Catholic church and a janitor applies who is a gay man, this would allow them to freely say, "No, we don't hire gay people." Despite the fact that any other employer, a non-religious employer, would of course be violating employment discrimination laws by doing so.</p>
                        <p>25:26 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>25:26 Peter: And I think this brings us unfortunately, to voting rights. Maybe the single most consistent project of John Roberts himself. The slow sort of attack on voting rights as they exist in America and the genuine erosion of what I think is any real claim to us being the most democratic country in the world.</p>
                        <p>25:52 Rhiannon: Right, yeah. This is the biggest, smelliest, pile of shit in John Roberts' legacy among many piles of shit.</p>
                        <p>26:00 Michael: Right. There were four voting rights cases this term actually. Yeah, you might be surprised to hear that because there was only one that I think really people considered like a decision, and that was RNC v. DNC. We did an episode on it, and I'll recap that in a second. But the other three took place in what's called the Court's shadow docket, which is all the decisions they make without oral argument. They don't get as much press, and it's like, "Are we gonna hear this case or not, or is the decision just gonna stand, is this ruling gonna be put on hold, or is it gonna go into effect?" Things like that, and it can have massive consequences. I wanna focus on two of the four 'cause I think they're pretty significant. So the first again is RNC v. DNC, which was about the Wisconsin Primary, which was happening right in the middle of COVID.</p>
                        <p>26:51 Michael: And if you didn't hear our episode on that or you don't really remember it, the issue was that the Board of Elections was just overwhelmed with requests for absentee ballots. There was just a fact that there were gonna be thousands of people who didn't get their absentee ballots on time to vote. Wisconsin law required that the ballots be filled out and returned and received by election day, and there were people who clearly were not even gonna get their ballots by then. So a district court just extended the deadline. It said, "Okay, instead of having to receive it by election day, you just have to receive it within five days of election day." And giving basically a full extra business week to the Board of Elections and to voters to get their shit together and get their votes in.</p>
                        <p>27:35 Rhiannon: Seems reasonable.</p>
                        <p>27:36 Michael: And the Supreme Court said, "No, thank you. That's a little too friendly to voters." And so what they said instead was, "Your ballot needs to be post-marked by election day." This is precisely the thing that that fucking douche Adler might say is a minimalist approach to this, but actually this does more sort of violence to the election process than the district courts did. Because what happens is, a few days before the election, standards change, it did turn out to be the case that thousands of voters didn't get their ballots in time to get them post-marked by election day, also some people got their ballots and sent them in on time because they were received a day or two after the election, but since this comes on government issued, postage paid, reply mail, they didn't get post-marked, and so the Board of Elections didn't know what to do with them. So it was a big mess. Some people voted in person, who otherwise they didn't want to, a number of people got sick from COVID, thousands of people got disenfranchised, who didn't need to, as a result of this ruling. And the Court based it on this idea that you don't change the rules of an election very close to that election, which set aside the fact that they changed the rules again, even closer to the election, in a way that was more restrictive and more confusing. It's just ridiculous because that rule applies in ordinary times, but COVID is not exactly an ordinary time.</p>
                        <p>29:04 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>29:05 Michael: And so if you compare that to this case, Raysor v. DeSantis in Florida, the court goes the exact opposite way. And you gotta bear with me for a sec 'cause the procedural history kinda matters here. So the State of Florida for a very long time had a law that said convicted felons lose their right to vote forever, as a relic of Jim Crow. And in 2018, the voters of Florida resoundingly rejected this, like something like 65%, a crazy number in modern day to get that many people behind it saying, "No. Once people have completed their term, they should be able to vote again, they should be able to re-enter society." And immediately, the Republicans in charge of the State House passed a law saying, "Well, okay, sure, but completing their terms doesn't just mean that they're out of jail, it doesn't mean that they've finish their period of parole, it also means that they've paid all their fines and fees, and restitution, and all that." Which is a problem for a number of reasons, that sounds a lot like a poll tax.</p>
                        <p>30:11 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:11 Michael: And so it was challenged in court.</p>
                        <p>30:13 Peter: Another reason we should add is that Florida has absolutely no understanding or a record of how much most of these people actually owe. So there's literally no way for them to satisfy this requirement and gain the right to vote.</p>
                        <p>30:26 Michael: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>30:26 Rhiannon: Right. And just to add to it, even if they did have specific records showing exactly what you owed once you get out of prison, you still have some fines and fees from your case or whatever, there is no recognition that this obviously disproportionately affects the poor. If you can't afford to pay your fines and fees, you can't vote, and that's not how we do things in this country, supposedly.</p>
                        <p>30:48 Peter: Well, yeah. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>30:49 Michael: Right, [chuckle] so right. Yeah, so back in October 2019, a district court heard this, and was like, "It looks like you guys are gonna win. There's a due process concern here." Florida said they don't think they'll know fully who does and does not owe fines and how much they owe till 2026, at the earliest.</p>
                        <p>31:07 Rhiannon: That's just wild.</p>
                        <p>31:09 Michael: And in addition, there's the fact that two similarly situated people, same offence, same sentence, completed it, one who has money and one who does not, one of them gets the right to vote, one does not, and that sounds a lot like a poll tax, which is illegal, and so he issues what's called a preliminary injunction, which means that for the time being, Florida is not allowed to enforce this law, and these 800,000 people affected by this, they're eligible to vote. It's a huge number in a big, important state. And that gets appealed and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals says, "We agree. This looks unconstitutional. This is the standard. This is how it should be reviewed legally." So the District Court has a trial. There's a lot of fact finding. And it says, "Look, I was right. This is really fucking unconstitutional." And enters permanent injunction saying, "This law is dead." State of Florida appeals that and the Court of Appeals just sits on it for months. And then, not even three weeks before the registration deadline, without opinion, says, "We're putting that on hold and we are reinstating the voting restrictions." A massive upheaval.</p>
                        <p>32:24 Michael: There have been thousands of people, possibly tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people who have registered to vote in the last nine months, who maybe intend to vote. And now, the court is saying, "Well, you might be registered to vote, but you currently are not eligible." This comes up to the Supreme Court and they have to decide, well, is the ruling in effect or not? Are the restrictions in place or not? And if you go back to the principle we talked about, do you change the rules up right before the election? It seems pretty clear that the status quo for nine months, which was that this law is not in effect, should be maintained. But instead, the court agreed with the Eleventh Circuit and reimposed these voting restrictions. And so now, there's just a class of people who don't know whether or not they can vote. They might not know this opinion happened. They registered to vote. They might just think that's it. I get to vote.</p>
                        <p>33:17 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>33:18 Michael: Or they might know about this decision, but not know whether or not they owe anything.</p>
                        <p>33:22 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:23 Michael: And if you vote and you're not eligible, that's a felony in Florida. It can be a mistake on your part. You can say that Florida never told me I owed any fines. I registered to vote legally. I did everything right, and that's still a felony. So this is a... It's a disaster, 800,000 people being denied the right to vote that the people of Florida overwhelmingly said to have that right, in the most confusing and difficult way possible, pretty much at the last minute. And this isn't just for a primary in August, although it is for that, very possible that this is in place in November for the presidential election, which is important, I think. And so, you can see the through line here, there's nothing principled about this. The through line is that it should be as hard to vote as possible. That's what Roberts and the conservatives believed. And this case was 54, of course, much like the Eleventh Circuit, the Supreme Court didn't bother justifying this absurd ruling. The other two cases are both pretty bad too, but they're less sort of egregious. One is a Texas restrictive absentee balloting law that the District Court said, "It's COVID, you can't be this restrictive about who can and can't go to absentee." Supreme Court said, "Fuck that. They can be as restrictive as they want. It doesn't matter if you're immunocompromised. You have to go vote in person."</p>
                        <p>34:44 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:44 Michael: And in Alabama, very similarly, laws that restricted absentee voting required people to go get their photo ID, copied and notarized in order to vote absentee. The District Court said, "Look, you shouldn't have to do that and you should be able to take your ballot and just drop it off curbside if necessary so you don't have to go into the polling station." The Supreme Court said, "No, thanks." So the thought of this stuff is, it's not hard to predict, just like in Wisconsin, there're gonna be thousands of people disenfranchised and there are gonna be a lot of people who get sick and a lot of people who have to choose between risking getting sick or voting, and either way, that's a choice they shouldn't be put to.</p>
                        <p>35:22 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>35:23 Michael: But that's their project. This is where he's one of his... At his most radical.</p>
                        <p>35:27 Peter: Yeah, absolutely, and it's important to contextualize the voting rights cases because it does not matter how many shallow victories Roberts hands the left if he continues to tack right on voting rights, because if he does that enough, all of the political branches of government will steadily fall more and more into Republican hands. The laws will become increasingly conservative, and it won't matter what the Supreme Court says because the political branch of the government will be pushing right. So Roberts' tiny steps left, weighed against the massive leap right that he's facilitating with the voting rights cases. I mean, it's obvious what the real outcome is here, and to say that he is moving the court overall left, is just an incredibly simplistic sort of tunneled way of thinking.</p>
                        <p>36:17 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:18 Peter: Alright, let's go to a fucking ad.</p>
                        <p>0:36:20.7 Peter: So my final thought on Roberts, before we move into the non-Roberts part of the wrap-up here, we're coming to a place where his ability to sit on the fence is likely to be tested. Trump is running Secret Federal Police in American cities against the will of state and local governments. His political party has engaged in an electoral strategy that is heavily reliant upon voter suppression. Trump talks about that fairly openly. And all of this creeping fascism is likely to be before the Supreme Court next year in some form or fashion. So my main response to people who, for some reason, believe that John Roberts has the intellectual clarity or moral courage or desire to stand it down is, we'll fucking see, right?</p>
                        <p>37:09 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:10 Peter: Give it a year and then write your article in The Washington Post about how you think John Roberts is our savior.</p>
                        <p>37:16 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:16 Rhiannon: And something we haven't mentioned is particularly this term, Roberts' strategic consolidation of power in himself over the course of the term and across opinions and cases. So Roberts has placed himself in the majority of the vast number of cases, this term.</p>
                        <p>37:37 Michael: Right. I forgot the precise number but it's like 62 out of 64.</p>
                        <p>37:40 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:41 Michael: Or we have 65. It's like almost all of them.</p>
                        <p>37:44 Rhiannon: Right, you can count on one hand, the number of cases that he's not in the majority on.</p>
                        <p>37:49 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:49 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:49 Rhiannon: And that's significant because the rule at the Supreme Court for who writes a decision is that when the Chief Justice is in the majority, the Chief Justice decides which Justice will write that majority opinion. And that means that indirectly, he is wielding power and control over how these majority opinions are written, even when he doesn't assign the case to himself. He is not choosing Justice Sotomayor to write the majority opinion in the case that protects DACA. It's not a mistake. It's not random, they didn't rock-paper-scissors it, so that Justice Gorsuch is writing the majority opinion. In Bostock v. Clayton County, the justices that he's choosing to write certain opinions, are going to write, say a narrower holding, a narrower rule, a more conservative angle on what you might call a liberal win.</p>
                        <p>38:43 Peter: Right. So we should talk about some non-Robert stuff. A lot of people asked us to talk about McGirt v. Oklahoma, where Gorsuch joined the liberals to hold that large portions of eastern Oklahoma remain an Indian reservation for purposes of federal law. That does not mean that half of Oklahoma belonged to the tribes. It does mean that it's a separate jurisdiction for the purpose of certain federal laws.</p>
                        <p>39:08 Rhiannon: Yeah, and it's a big win for Indian law for Indian country.</p>
                        <p>39:12 Peter: It is, and ironically may the most caveat-free win for the liberals, of the entire term. And Roberts wasn't part of the majority, and in fact, Roberts writes the Dissent, which is basically a full endorsement of scrapping treaties the government entered into with the tribes because they'd be too difficult and complicated to maintain. Just an intellectually bankrupt position.</p>
                        <p>39:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, and don't call him a minimalist. He's writing to completely dismantle, literally hundreds of years of law.</p>
                        <p>39:42 Peter: Right, and we have to say something. In our Epic Systems episode, just a couple of episodes ago, we made fun of Gorsuch's tedious writing and we wanna issue a partial retraction because McGirt was very well-written, poignantly written. It caused me to go back to make sure that Epic Systems was as bad as I remembered, and it was... [laughter] Now I'm just trying to figure out why. Obviously, part of it is just bias. When you read something you agree with, you're like, "Yeah, this is good," and when you disagree, you think it's worse. But it's more than that. I really think that Gorsuch really cares about tribal law issues. He's just passionate about it, and you can feel it in his writing, whereas Epic Systems is just very outcome driven. He wanted to reach a conclusion and he found some technicalities to get them there.</p>
                        <p>40:29 Michael: Yeah, no, the opinion comes from a place of real empathy, which comes through, and I also think that if he listens to our episode and he's like "What? I got to step it up."</p>
                        <p>40:39 Rhiannon: Absolutely. Yeah. For sure.</p>
                        <p>40:40 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>40:41 Michael: "They're dragging me."</p>
                        <p>40:42 Rhiannon: For sure. He said, "Oh my God, The Law Boy, he doesn't like me."</p>
                        <p>40:47 Peter: Yeah, that's what he calls me, he calls me The Law Boy. So, some other trends this term, one I wanna point out is that Thomas really seems to have just fallen into the role of an Alito-style doctrinaire conservative. He was long viewed as conservative, and maybe even particularly conservative but also sort of quirky and with a lot of very odd beliefs about retracting huge swaths of precedent and etcetera. Now he seems very just standard bare. And part of that, is because he is increasingly sort of polarized from a political perspective.</p>
                        <p>41:30 Michael: He's been watching too much of Fox news.</p>
                        <p>41:31 Peter: Yeah. The other part though, is that the standard conservative legal line is much farther right than it was 10 or 20 years ago, and so he's starting to look like he's one of them, when in fact what's really happened is he's dragged them in his direction.</p>
                        <p>41:47 Rhiannon: Right, that's exactly right.</p>
                        <p>41:49 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>41:49 Rhiannon: He's not so much a fringe legal freak.</p>
                        <p>41:51 Michael: And this goes back to an earlier point Peter made about the difficulty in statistically measuring a specific justice is like adrift left or right. If Thomas is dragging the entire conservative legal institution to the right and Roberts is standing still, then Roberts isn't moving left, the ground is just moving underneath him. And it's just more extreme decisions and more extreme arguments coming before him.</p>
                        <p>42:23 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>42:23 Rhiannon: Beautiful.</p>
                        <p>42:25 Peter: And we should also mention Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a public statement a couple of weeks back that her cancer has returned and she is undergoing chemotherapy. And we've occasionally gotten some shit because we rag on RBG a lot and have made cracks about her health, and I wanna say something about that. We've made our general position on her tenure clear. Her failure to retire before 2014 was incredibly reckless and may well have put the court at risk for a generation. Her health situation is sad. When she dies, it will be sad but our analysis of powerful people at the end of their lives should involve more than a pat on the back for having achieved success.</p>
                        <p>43:12 Peter: They deserve scrutiny and they deserve to have a light shined on their failures. Those should be the wages of power, and when someone in her position can do something as selfish and dangerous as she did, when she decided to stay on the court into her 80s and receive almost nothing but praise and admiration, that's a sincere failure of public accountability. So you can feel free to tell us that seeking some catharsis by being a little mean to her is in bad taste, but we're not the ones who bet the well-being and dignity of millions on our own health.</p>
                        <p>43:43 Rhiannon: That's exactly right. And she can be a feminist icon. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the person who changed Sex Discrimination Law by and large, in the United States, and that's incredible. But today, for me and a lot of people like me who live in the Fifth Circuit and incredibly conservative federal appeals court district, it's not empowering that, my right, my access to reproductive justice and reproductive choice rests on a dying woman who is 90 years old. That's not Yes, Queen! Feminism and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for all of her public service and for everything that she's done for particularly women and the liberal side of the law, has not earned just 100% praise from the public. That's not how her position works and that's not how her public service works.</p>
                        <p>44:37 Michael: And just a reminder that since they have life terms, they have life tenure. This is the only way to have accountability.</p>
                        <p>44:46 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>44:47 Michael: Politicians are doing that, you can throw the bums out, at least in theory, but if a Justice is fucking up is imperiling her own legacy, the only way you can hold them accountable is just telling them, they're an idiot.</p>
                        <p>45:02 Rhiannon: Is by saying it.</p>
                        <p>45:03 Michael: That they're gambling with everybody's rights,'cause we can't do anything else, that's all you can do.</p>
                        <p>45:09 Peter: First of all, it's obvious that we're a little harder on her than we otherwise might be because she is ostensibly an ally. She's quite far left as far as Justices go, but the reason she has given for her decision to stay on the court, are basically that she feels she should do it until she cannot. And I don't know how to describe that other than somewhere between naivete and just raw idiocy.</p>
                        <p>45:31 Michael: Or extreme narcissism.</p>
                        <p>45:34 Rhiannon: Extreme narcissism, cynically, right? To think, "I'm the person for the job and nobody else can do it as good as me, even in this state, forever."</p>
                        <p>45:42 Peter: Yeah, but I have a ton of faith that she's gonna keep doing hardcore workouts. That should be enough to keep her alive through her 19th cancer of the past decade, or whatever the fuck this is.</p>
                        <p>45:54 Rhiannon: Keep up the planks girl, proud of you.</p>
                        <p>45:57 Michael: Our producer is unhappy with that joke.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>46:02 Peter: I have some communication with RBGs trainer, and he told me that she did five reps of holding her head up with her neck, just this morning.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>46:14 Rhiannon: Yes, get it on Instagram girl.</p>
                        <p>46:16 Peter: Anyway, I will say this though, if she survives and Biden is elected and she dies or retires, we will do an episode about her and it will be mostly nice. If she dies and Trump replaces her, on my dying breath, I will never say a nice thing about that woman.</p>
                        <p>46:35 Rhiannon: It's, "Fuck RBG till I die."</p>
                        <p>46:42 Peter: I have one more thing to say about this term, and it implicates the next term. One interesting development in the court is that the Trump administration, frequently a party before the Supreme Court, of course, has at several points in the last several years, expressly lied to the court about what their motivations were for certain laws. We talked about this in Trump v. Hawaii, the Muslim-ban case, now there it was sort of... It's a little gray almost.</p>
                        <p>47:10 Peter: We believe, of course, he's motivated by discriminatory animus towards Muslims, but there was a case last year regarding the Census, and if you'll recall, the Trump administration tried to add a citizenship question to the census. And they claimed that they were doing so to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, which if you're familiar with the Trump administration, you can immediately read that as a lie, because they have never once tried to enforce the Voting Rights Act.</p>
                        <p>47:38 Rhiannon: No, yeah.</p>
                        <p>47:39 Peter: What they were actually doing, as several commentators pointed out at the time almost certainly, was preparing for an argument that the amount of Congressman that each state gets should be determined based on the amount of citizens in the state. Now, until now, it's been about the amount of persons in the state, which is the word used in the Constitution. This means that what they were actually doing last year when they claimed that they were trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act with this information was flatly lying to the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>48:15 Peter: And there is a real question in the next term when this case is heard about whether the court chooses to address that, to address the fact that the Trump administration has several times now been flagrantly dishonest with the court. And this is probably the most explicit and I sort of think that Roberts has a little too much pride to let it completely slide. I believe that he will hedge, I believe that he will create space for the Trump administration to work, but I really believe that he is gonna be a little bit offended. But the real boundaries of just how clearly and obviously the Court will allow the Trump administration to lie to it, is gonna be a big part of the next term. In conclusion, Supreme Court bad 2020, Supreme Court term also bad, if this is the only part of the episode you hear, you're up to speed.</p>
                        <p>49:09 Rhiannon: Right, you got it. [laughter] Now get out there.</p>
                        <p>49:18 Peter: Alright, next week, Milliken v. Bradley, a case about segregation and busing in the '70s, special guest, I might pronounce this wrong, Leon Neyfakh.</p>
                        <p>49:30 Rhiannon: I don't know, who is that guy?</p>
                        <p>49:33 Peter: Our friend, Leon. He's hopping on the show to talk about segregation. To all of our listeners, well, first of all, follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod, and good luck avoiding getting captured by Secret Federal Police for the next several weeks. That's a thing. Lay low. Lay physically low. If you stand still, cops cannot see you. That is a fact about that.</p>

                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: Case I have to announce is number 94-8729, Bennis against Michigan.</p>
                        <p>00:14 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Bennis v. Michigan. At issue is civil forfeiture, a practice that allows law enforcement to seize a person's private property if it's implicated in an alleged crime and to keep it, whether or not the owner is found guilty.</p>
                        <p>00:35 [Archival]: You don't need to be proven guilty of a crime for your goods to be taken away.</p>
                        <p>00:38 [Archival]: So there's no trial, there's no requirement to provide evidence to prove the state's suspicion, they just take your stuff.</p>
                        <p>00:47 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:00 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court decisions that have broken down American society like radiation on human DNA. I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy. I'm here with Rhiannon...</p>
                        <p>01:16 Rhiannon: Hi, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Michael: Hey.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Peter: And today we are talking about Bennis v. Michigan. This is a case about civil forfeiture, the process that allows cops to permanently seize the property of criminal suspects, whether or not they've been convicted of a crime. This is the latest addition to our catalog of episodes in which the Court gives a big thumbs up to the most on their face egregious practices of the American criminal justice system. And before we get into it, I'm gonna pose a law school-style hypothetical to our listeners...</p>
                        <p>01:50 Rhiannon: Oh.</p>
                        <p>01:51 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:52 Rhiannon: A little blast from the past.</p>
                        <p>01:54 Peter: That's right, you are a married woman. You and your husband co-own a car that you share. One day, that no good son of a bitch goes and hires a prostitute, and they do it in your car, they get busted...</p>
                        <p>02:09 Rhiannon: They do what?</p>
                        <p>02:09 Peter: Prostitute stuff, you know. Some cops bust them, right, and now the question is, who does the car belong to? If you answered the police department, you are correct. If not, you're gonna wanna keep listening. This case is from 1996, and it goes 5-4 along mostly ideological lines, with one exception. Kennedy joins the dissenters, while a young and spry Notorious RBG joins the conservatives. Yet another example of just how weak and out of touch Ginsburg often is on issues concerning police abuses.</p>
                        <p>02:57 Rhiannon: Yeah, thanks a lot, Ruth.</p>
                        <p>03:00 Peter: It was a different time, though. Mid-90s, Fresh Prince still on the air.</p>
                        <p>03:03 Rhiannon: And that caused Ruth to be a dumb ass, I guess.</p>
                        <p>03:06 Michael: The one and only cultural touchstone.</p>
                        <p>03:06 Peter: That's my guiding light.</p>
                        <p>03:12 Michael: Peter's lone star, the run of Fresh Prince.</p>
                        <p>03:16 Peter: The majority is written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who we've noted in the past is an all-time piece of shit.</p>
                        <p>03:23 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>03:24 Peter: We'll talk a little bit about his judicial philosophy, 'cause it's not just important to this case, but also to how a lot of conservatives perceive the Constitution. Conservatives and especially the ostensibly serious conservative intellectuals will often talk about how they favor small government, and as many people have observed, any digging will reveal that what they mean is a small federal government and that they are then surprisingly supportive of leaving people at the violent whims of state and local governments. First, we should go through how civil forfeiture proceedings happen. How does this work?</p>
                        <p>04:00 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, totally. So what we're talking about is police taking property when somebody is arrested for a crime and then that property, the ownership being transferred to the county or the state that you're in, regardless of what happens with the criminal case. So just up top want to state that every state in the US has different civil forfeiture laws, and federal law enforcement and the Department of Justice have their own civil forfeiture scheme. So this rundown of how civil forfeiture proceedings kind of work in court is gonna be just really general. Broadly speaking, three types of property are subject to being forfeited: That's contraband, instrumentalities, and proceeds.</p>
                        <p>04:47 Rhiannon: Now, contraband is property that is illegal in and of it itself, say like methamphetamine or counterfeit money, and instrumentality is property that is used in furtherance of criminal activity, so for example, like a car that's used to traffic drugs, and then proceeds are obviously like the profits of illegal activity. These three kinds of property are typically what can be seized by law enforcement and then forfeited to the jurisdiction that you're in. So for example, in a lot of states in the US, say you're pulled over for a traffic stop and over the course of that stop, the police find drugs in your car. If the police suspect that your car is being used as part of, say, suspected drug trafficking, then according to civil forfeiture laws, the car can be taken from you.</p>
                        <p>05:40 Rhiannon: So the legal question of whether that property has been seized properly by the police and whether ownership of that property can be transferred to the county or the state, that happens in a civil proceeding rather than as part of the criminal case. Separate and apart from the criminal case in which an individual's guilt is determined, there's another kind of case that makes its way through civil court as opposed to criminal court, and it only has to do with whether the property seized in a criminal case can now belong to the county or the state. Without getting too technical, there's this idea from English common law that property used or money earned as part of criminal activity is also said to be guilty, so to speak. Like the property, right, the thing, separate and apart from the person who's accused of criminal activity, and our law allows for what's called an in-rem proceeding, meaning a lawsuit against an item rather than a person.</p>
                        <p>06:41 Peter: Giving me deep flashbacks to the parts of property law that I did not understand.</p>
                        <p>06:46 Rhiannon: Yeah, and civil procedure. So I personally, in my own practice, I've seen many of these civil forfeiture cases happen in court, and so just to explain the difference a little bit. In a criminal case, like the case name, right, we're all familiar with that. It'll be like State of Texas versus Don Johnson, name of the person, but like the accompanying civil forfeiture case, that case is called State of Texas versus 2014 Hyundai Elantra. It is a civil proceeding against a piece of property.</p>
                        <p>07:16 Peter: Hyundai, how do you plead?</p>
                        <p>07:19 Rhiannon: Right, and the in-rem proceeding can move through their court completely separate and regardless of the result in the in personam criminal proceeding. But what happens in the lawsuit against the property is that basically, again, this is really over-simplified, but basically a prosecutor shows that the property was seized properly by police pursuant to suspected criminal activity, and then civil forfeiture law says that ownership of that property can therefore be transferred to the county or the state.</p>
                        <p>07:48 Peter: Congratulations, Texas, you are now the proud owner of a 2014 Hyundai Elantra.</p>
                        <p>07:54 Rhiannon: Exactly. And an owner of the property can contest the lawsuit or assert her own defenses to the property being seized, but that doesn't happen often, and we'll talk about that later. In practice, like I said, I've seen this tons of times in rural Texas counties where I've been a public defender, sometimes like the entire civil docket will be civil forfeitures on a given day in court, and it'll be like a long list of cases and the judge just read them off and it's this crazy, almost like robotic automatic moving through the docket. So it'll be like State of Texas versus 2009 Chevy Silverado, State of Texas versus $1785, State of Texas versus Sea-Doo Jet Ski, over and over and over, like dozens of cases.</p>
                        <p>08:39 Rhiannon: And the judge calls off each case and the prosecutor will just say the boiler plate legal terms of art that are necessary. So, like, Your Honor, this property came into the possession of the county when the police department seized it pursuant to an arrest for trafficking, yada yada yada. And the judge says, "Is anybody here to contest this" Silence in the courtroom, and the judge goes, "Granted," to every single one, and then moves on.</p>
                        <p>09:02 Peter: That is my Sea-Doo, Your Honor, and it did nothing wrong.</p>
                        <p>09:10 Rhiannon: And then the judge moves on. And so the people whose property has been taken, a lot of times never know that they can show up to fight the case, they never even know where their property had been taken. You do have to be given notice that the property is going through this proceeding, but if you don't speak English, sometimes the property that's seized is less valuable than what it would cost to hire a lawyer to represent you to fight it. It's also the burden that the prosecutor has to show is often really, really low. So even if you say like, hey, wait, that's mine and I need that, that's not enough to get your property back. All the state has to show in a lot of cases is that it was just seized as part of suspected criminal activity, that's it, and then they can own it. And the prosecutor's office or the police then use all of that property that's newly come into their ownership, and remember, this includes straight up cash, sometimes, they can use all of that for their own use or they set up auctions to sell stuff like cars, etcetera, so.</p>
                        <p>10:12 Peter: Well, that all makes perfect sense.</p>
                        <p>10:16 Rhiannon: Yeah, great.</p>
                        <p>10:17 Peter: So I guess let's move on to what happened here, because I'm totally comfortable with how that all works.</p>
                        <p>10:25 Rhiannon: Right. So let's talk about Bennis versus Michigan and what happened in this case to get to the Supreme Court. Gotta say, Peter hinted at it, but these facts, they feel like a good country song, like somebody should write a nice song about poor Tina Bennis. This one's a little juicier than the dumb shit we usually have to talk about, so, yeah, okay. Tina and John Bennis are a married couple living in Detroit, Michigan in 1988.</p>
                        <p>10:51 Peter: But it gets worse.</p>
                        <p>10:56 Rhiannon: When one night, John doesn't come home at the usual time after work. Now Tina, a concerned wife, she's frantic, she starts making phone calls, and the next morning, finally she gets ahold of a donut addict at the Detroit police station and she learns that, what do you know, dear husband John is in jail 'cause he was arrested last night for soliciting a sex worker. And as if this isn't bad enough for Tina's life, her rolling stone was caught engaged in illegal sexual activity inside the car that John and Tina owned together, it's a 1977 Pontiac. So John and Tina in fact had split the $600 cost and purchase that car together, and now Tina's cheating ass husband is in jail and she doesn't have a car, 'cause the county seized it when John was arrested, saying that it was part of his criminal activity in soliciting a sex worker.</p>
                        <p>11:56 Rhiannon: So the county moved to forfeit ownership of the car from the Bennises to them under the Michigan specific statutes at that time. And remember, earlier I said that in these civil forfeiture cases, often the legal basis for forfeiture is this legal fiction that a piece of property is somehow guilty. So here in the Michigan case, the county filed a lawsuit that gets the Bennises' Pontiac declared a public nuisance. And then their ownership interest, the Bennises' ownership interest in the property, is forfeited to the county.</p>
                        <p>12:31 Peter: To be fair, it does sound ridiculous that the Pontiac could itself be guilty, but if any car was going to solicit sex, I feel like a '77 Pontiac sounds about right.</p>
                        <p>12:43 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right. Okay, so Tina says, wait a minute, my raggedy piece of shit husband aside, that's my car too. I paid for it, it's my private property, and I didn't know my soon-to-be ex-husband was gonna go around getting illegal blowies in it. Tina wants to assert what's called an innocent owner defense, which is to say I own this piece of property that was seized, but I was innocent of any criminal activity, and so I should retain my ownership in that property. But Michigan law didn't allow for an innocent owner defense to civil forfeiture.</p>
                        <p>13:20 Rhiannon: So the trial judge in Wayne County basically said like so what, Tina, and ordered that the car be confiscated. And he noted that he could order that Tina Bennis be compensated for the $300 that she put into the car to purchase it, but he notes like, I'm not gonna do that. And his legal reasoning is basically that the car is an old piece of shit, like he says, "There's practically nothing left minus costs in a situation such as this." And I feel like, okay, fine, like Mr. Shady Shade, like insult their car or whatever. But why then is it so important for the county to seize ownership if it's a valueless car?</p>
                        <p>14:01 Rhiannon: So at any rate, Tina Bennis appeals this decision from Wayne County Court, she appeals it up and it makes its way up to the Supreme Court. Specifically what the Supreme Court is deciding in this case is whether Tina, not being able to assert an innocent owner defense, whether that violates the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>14:18 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:19 Rhiannon: Hey, wait, let's go to an ad.</p>
                        <p>14:21 Peter: So let's talk about the law. There are two constitutional amendments at play here: The Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the government from taking your property without just compensation...</p>
                        <p>14:32 Rhiannon: That's a good one.</p>
                        <p>14:33 Peter: And the Fourteenth Amendment, which says that the government cannot take your property without due process of law.</p>
                        <p>14:38 Rhiannon: Another great one.</p>
                        <p>14:39 Michael: Yeah, big fan of the Fourteenth.</p>
                        <p>14:40 Rhiannon: That got that one, two punch there, hit them, Fourteenth.</p>
                        <p>14:44 Peter: So Tina, this woman whose life is just an absolute shambles, is essentially saying that When you confiscate my car for something my husband did when I didn't know about it, that is fundamentally unfair to me and should be considered a violation of my due process rights, and also I was not compensated for it. And the court's like, no, actually, no, we think that that's okay. Whatever.</p>
                        <p>15:10 Rhiannon: It's good. It's right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:14 Peter: So the opinion opens up by talking about precedent, which is like how you know there's absolutely no good reason for what it's about to hold. They're basically saying, look, it may seem unfair to you that you can lose your car because your husband was doing something illegal in it, but the government has been pulling this bullshit for centuries, so our hands are tied. And so this opinion, no joke, opens up by talking about a case from 1827, where a ship that had been commissioned by the King of Spain attacked a US vessel and was therefore held to be forfeited, even though the owner himself was not responsible for the attack. The court there held that the offense was attached primarily to the ship, so the ship itself could be seized.</p>
                        <p>15:55 Peter: This is sort of getting back at what Rhiannon was talking about, where the ship is guilty. So on top of the fact that this makes no sense, because the ship itself is not responsible for an attack, like who gives a shit about this? As a rule, if you find yourself investigating a situation involving the King of Spain in 1827, so you can figure out what to do about a guy who paid $6 for a blow job in a Pontiac in 1993, maybe you should take a step back and ask yourself What the fuck you're doing. And so Rehnquist just keeps going on. He then cites to an 1878 case about a person who was leasing a distillery, a 1926 case about a car dealership... I assume that was the first car dealership. Finally, the most recent... That was not that good, Rhi.</p>
                        <p>16:47 Rhiannon: I was just thinking about the first car dealership ever, like it's funny.</p>
                        <p>16:53 Peter: Some guy was like, "What if I sold these cars? What if I had a bunch of 'em?"</p>
                        <p>16:58 Rhiannon: Right. They're like transitioning, so they also sell horses and horse-drawn carriages, and they're like, look, we got this new technology shit.</p>
                        <p>17:06 Peter: You want a car or a unicycle? So Rehnquist then finally gets to the most recent case about this, a 1974 case about a yacht lease, where the court rejected the so-called innocent owner defense. And what he essentially says is like, look, we've been holding that property can be forfeit even if the owner is innocent for all these years, it simply cannot be a violation of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>17:32 Rhiannon: Nothing we can do.</p>
                        <p>17:34 Peter: Yeah, and this touches on an important aspect of conservative jurisprudence that we've discussed before, the weaponization of history to justify the present. In simple terms, conservatives view legal rights as static over time; more specifically, they view past interpretations of constitutional rights as sort of necessarily shedding light upon what the correct interpretation is in the present. And the result is that we are somehow in the modern day obligated to abide by the same rules as we did during a time when infant mortality was like 45%. And all of this discussion of precedent serves as a very effective dodge of the real question, which is, does this rule make any sense at all.</p>
                        <p>18:26 Peter: Like we mentioned, the premise is that the property being seized is somehow attached to the criminal offense that it was used to commit, as if the property itself is guilty. But that doesn't really make any sense, obviously. The fact that an inanimate object was used to commit a crime does not mean that the crime and the object are somehow meaningfully intertwined with one another. One of conservatives' favorite sayings is "guns don't kill people, people kill people." In my mind, maybe a bit of an over-simplification, but a much more convincing slogan is "cars don't hire prostitutes, people hire prostitutes."</p>
                        <p>19:07 Peter: The car is not related to the crime, it's not even really making the crime easier, at least drastically easier, so what good reason is there to deprive a rightful owner of her right to the car because it was used by someone who happened to be hiring a prostitute at the time. And if there's no good reason besides the fact that we've always done it, how can it not be a violation of her constitutional right to due process? I think that's like the bottom line for me. One of the dissents here is by Justice John Paul Stevens. The dissent itself hits all the major points, I think, and maybe the funnest part of it is that when he says that using this logic, the government could seize a cruise ship because one passenger committed a crime.</p>
                        <p>19:45 Peter: And I swear to God, Rehnquist's only response to this is literally, "Well, we've never held that the government could seize a cruise ship because one passenger committed a crime."</p>
                        <p>19:53 Rhiannon: Thanks, Bill.</p>
                        <p>19:55 Peter: Stevens is saying, look, this rule cannot be right because it would lead to these insane outcomes, and Rehnquist goes, yeah, but this case isn't about cruise ships, buddy, so whatever.</p>
                        <p>20:05 Rhiannon: That's something else.</p>
                        <p>20:07 Michael: It's so fucking dumb.</p>
                        <p>20:08 Peter: It's so fucking dumb. Just no regard for whether or not the reasoning he's using is sound, and also sort of implying like, yeah, well, if that happens, we'll just make up a rule that says you can't do it, bada bing, bada boom. You lose, Stevens. The next thing he does is dive into some of the reasons that the rule exists, and they're all just dogshit stupid. He says, look, this isn't meant to punish the owners, it has a deterrent purpose, it prevents the illegal use of property by "rendering a legal activity unprofitable." This is the kind of reasoning that should get you disbarred, I think. Anyone who understands the meaning of words can tell you that you can't deter crimes by punishing people who don't have anything to do with the crime. This woman was sitting at home. She can't be deterred from doing anything, it's bizarre.</p>
                        <p>21:00 Michael: In light of this ruling, wives aren't gonna stop like co-owning cars with their husbands.</p>
                        <p>21:07 Peter: That'll teach you to trust that piece of shit you married, Tina. That's the whole point, is they don't know that their property is being used for illegal activity. It's the whole point. To give him a little bit of credit, I think what he's getting at is to say like, look, you'll be more careful with who you let use your property, if you know the government can seize it if a crime happens. Not only is that extremely tenuous, it's not addressing the situation here, which is just punishing an innocent party. It's especially bizarre in the context of a marriage, but it's really bizarre in almost any context where you just sort of loan out your property to someone who has a good reason to use it.</p>
                        <p>21:43 Michael: Right, and Rehnquist doesn't talk about another reason for civil forfeiture to exist. And it's because a big reason for its existence actually cuts against everything he wants to do here. Yeah, interestingly enough, as Peter mentioned, it starts with admiralty, maritime cases, and all the early cases are on the ocean, boats or customs, import export stuff. What those have in common is that often the actual guilty party isn't in the personal jurisdiction of the United States' courts, so you can't go arrest the King of Spain or whatever, all you have is the shit, you have their contraband, you have their boat.</p>
                        <p>22:29 Michael: And so you're like, well, we can't drag him into court, but we can take his shit. But you can bring John Bennis into court here. There's no level of applicability to that sort of animating principle for this at all in the modern uses of civil forfeiture.</p>
                        <p>22:44 Rhiannon: That's a really good point.</p>
                        <p>22:45 Peter: Right. There's also this Fifth Amendment argument. The Fifth Amendment is about the Takings Clause, which says the government cannot seize property for private use without compensation, and Tina Bennis is saying I wasn't compensated.</p>
                        <p>23:00 Rhiannon: Right, and generally like this Fifth Amendment Taking Clause, that refers to eminent domain, the process by which the government takes private property and puts it to public use, so for example, like seizing property that it will use for development. But Rehnquist says, well, look, this isn't an eminent domain seizure, it's a different type of proceeding, so the Takings Clause just doesn't even apply.</p>
                        <p>23:24 Peter: Yeah. And this argument is bizarre to me, like the point of the Takings Clause is to limit the ability of government to seize your property. So it seems weird to say that there's basically an end run around that in situations where the government has an excuse, basically. We talked about the Takings Clause in our Kelo v. New London episode, where they seized a property and used it to try to develop it. That's the main use for eminent domain. But the function of the clause in the Fifth Amendment seems to me like it should be broader than that, right. The government can't just take your property for public use, but it can take it if someone else uses it for illegal shit? I'm not super familiar, I admit, with the jurisprudence on this, so I don't wanna overstate the point, but it seems to me to fundamentally undermine the promise of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
                        <p>24:11 Rhiannon: Right, I think if you think about why we have that clause, it's not just eminent domain, it's about takings generally.</p>
                        <p>24:21 Peter: Yeah, if it really is designed to constrict government power, then it shouldn't be limited to very specific contexts.</p>
                        <p>24:29 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>24:29 Peter: So I wanna talk about the dissents and the concurrences a little bit here. As we mentioned, Stevens' dissent, very solid, it starts with a great opening line: "For centuries, prostitutes have been plying their trade on other people's property."</p>
                        <p>24:43 Rhiannon: Okay, Stevens, alright, Johnny.</p>
                        <p>24:46 Peter: Yeah, buddy, yeah, buddy.</p>
                        <p>24:47 Rhiannon: You got it, dude.</p>
                        <p>24:49 Peter: To put this in perspective, Stevens was like 80 years old.</p>
                        <p>24:52 Rhiannon: Right. And still, Stevens said sex worker rights now.</p>
                        <p>24:56 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>24:56 Michael: But he was like a navy man, right, in his younger days.</p>
                        <p>25:00 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>25:00 Michael: He probably docked his ship in many foreign ports of call.</p>
                        <p>25:06 Peter: That's right. So yeah, the rest of his dissent makes a very compelling case in my mind that it should be unconstitutional to seize property that is only incidentally used in criminal activity.</p>
                        <p>25:18 Michael: And he has a really good example of this. He talks about real property, like an apartment building, and he was like, look, nobody contests that you can't seize an apartment building from its owner because one tenant was like smoking a joint in his unit. And Stevens' point is like, look, the car is being used in the same way, it's just a place to do it, right, it's not like when you're bootlegging or pirateering or whatever. And he knows that this point was actually addressed in the Michigan courts, and the way they get around it is by saying, well, look, as I think Rhiannon said up top, this car is a nuisance, and the reason it's a nuisance is because it was being used in an area that is itself an ongoing nuisance. This area is so blighted, that like everything in it's a nuisance, and especially if you're like getting a blow job in it, your car's a nuisance.</p>
                        <p>26:11 Michael: And this kind of highlights like the inherent inequality built into this. Some rich asshole in a nice neighborhood can get a blow job in his car, and that wouldn't be a public nuisance because it's a nice neighborhood, so his fucking Mercedes can't be taken by the state.</p>
                        <p>26:27 Peter: Yeah, the prostitute's cuter. The judge is like, yeah, this whole thing looks good to me.</p>
                        <p>26:30 Michael: Yeah, so I mean, it's just total bullshit, and it kind of shows just how unfair and injust this is.</p>
                        <p>26:38 Peter: Justice Kennedy, just a quick aside, to give him some credit here, he files a very short dissent. We have noted in the past that we consider him a pretty dumb guy. All of his best decisions are sort of the result of his libertarian streak, and this is one of them, and it comes up in gay marriage cases too. Here and there, he will pop up with these sort of libertarian takes and say, I don't think the government should be able to do this. And you know, pat on the back. Ginsburg files a concurrence, as we mentioned, it's just her at her worst.</p>
                        <p>27:08 Rhiannon: Just awful.</p>
                        <p>27:09 Peter: I think the reason she files a concurrence is to sort of try to explain herself here, and she basically tries to rely on the technicalities and procedures of the specific case and the specific Michigan law to justify the Court's approach. She goes so far to point out that they had another car.</p>
                        <p>27:24 Rhiannon: Tina and John Bennis did.</p>
                        <p>27:26 Peter: Yeah. As if your constitutional right to not have your car seized for no good reason disappears when you have like two cars or whatever. She focuses on these minor technical points about the case rather than addressing the broader issue of what the state can do constitutionally to someone who has not done a single thing wrong.</p>
                        <p>27:46 Michael: There are two little technicalities in particular that she hangs her hat on, which is one that the Court had discretion to like give Tina Bennis money back, a reminder of how to use that discretion is to not give her anything and insult her. The other thing she hangs her hat on is that... This is all when the court is sitting in equity, that's how these are decided, rather than a court of law, a court of equity, sort of considerations of fairness predominate more so than strict legal rules, which is why like the court has discretion to maybe give her money and things like that. It's like what's fair.</p>
                        <p>28:20 Peter: This is something that only lawyers know, the whole equity concept, but there's an entirely different part of the law that is like the equitable part of law, where courts are just like, they're sort of measuring what is fair, and it's considered a separate and unique part of the law for how courts usually analyze cases.</p>
                        <p>28:37 Michael: Where fairness just doesn't matter.</p>
                        <p>28:42 Rhiannon: We're saying like fairness is a different part of the law than just regular law, right?</p>
                        <p>28:47 Michael: At best a secondary concern in the normal course of things.</p>
                        <p>28:51 Peter: Like the fact that the court is allowed to consider fairness is separate and apart from whether they were actually fair to her, so I don't see how this gets around the fundamental problem here.</p>
                        <p>29:03 Peter: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>29:04 Michael: Yeah, her punctuation is saying like, look, we wouldn't be showing respect to Michigan if we don't think they would be good at equitably administering these sorts of actions, and it's like this very case, the equities, the discretion were abused and all they did was humiliate this woman.</p>
                        <p>29:24 Rhiannon: Exactly. It's fundamentally unfair, on its face.</p>
                        <p>29:26 Michael: As a note for how dumb this argument is, you would never guess how cops and state courts handled their freedom under this law in Michigan. For the next 20 years, it was one of the worst states in the country on civil forfeiture, and they've just in the last few years, being updating and improving their laws and the sorts of improvements they're making highlight how fucking bad it was. So one law on 2015 was like, you have to have clear and convincing evidence, not a preponderance of evidence, which is like the lowest fucking standard. Basically it means like 51%, and in 2019, they changed it so that you actually have to be convicted of a crime, 'cause before, as with Tina, you don't even have to be convicted and they could take your shit and never bring charges, and your shit is gone forever.</p>
                        <p>30:15 Peter: I think this is a pretty good time for an ad.</p>
                        <p>30:18 Peter: Alright, I think it would be useful to discuss some civil forfeiture facts.</p>
                        <p>30:22 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>30:23 Peter: What does this look like kind of nationwide?</p>
                        <p>30:26 Rhiannon: Yeah, so the pigs are always gonna say that they need civil forfeiture to fight crime. So like for example, I think this quote sort of just highlights what you're always gonna hear from cops when they are asked about civil forfeiture. Back in 2017, when speaking to the state legislature, a Texas county sheriff said: "Many times in my law enforcement career, we could not have been effective in doing away with gangs, drug cartels and whatever without the civil asset forfeiture. Many times forfeiting civil assets is the only way you're gonna get the kingpin of the operation."</p>
                        <p>31:01 Peter: Yeah, that's why there's no cartels anymore.</p>
                        <p>31:04 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. That's not what the data on civil forfeiture bears out, and what we know about civil forfeiture activity is that point blank, it's policing for-profit. Like on the one hand, forfeiture activity in the past 20 to 30 years has completely exploded, but on the other hand, like Peter just said, we haven't taken out the drug cartels yet, so obviously it's not that fucking effective. The Texas Tribune did a report based on 560 forfeiture cases filed in 2016 across four Texas counties. Half of the cash seizures were for less than $3000; 20% of the cases did not result in anyone even being charged with a crime, and in 40% of the cases, no one was ever found guilty of a crime connected to the seizure.</p>
                        <p>31:52 Rhiannon: So they're not using this to get at kingpins, they're stealing money from poor people, period. And this was just one year of cases from three rural counties in Texas and six months of cases from a large urban county, and the total value of assets seized was almost $10 million. Texas has 254 counties, so you can imagine the sheer size, the scale of what civil forfeiture does to, say, local economies, frankly. Okay, now the Feds, I think I said this up top, but the federal government has its own civil forfeiture scheme, and we have some data on that.</p>
                        <p>32:34 Rhiannon: In 1986, the Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture Fund took in almost $94 million, but by 2014, annual deposits into that fund had reached $4.5 billion. That's an increase of more than 4500%. And I think it's important to note that civil forfeiture activity is sort of exploding, really ratcheting up on an exponential level, at the same time as the war on drugs, general police activity across the country and sort of the engine of mass incarceration really ratcheting up. And important to note, it's not just people's cash and cars that law enforcement is seizing, the pigs will seize people's homes, homes, literally.</p>
                        <p>33:23 Rhiannon: Philadelphia has a notoriously aggressive civil forfeiture system, and just one case from 2014 I think highlights how egregious these practices often are. A guy named Chris Sourovelis, his son was arrested outside the family home for selling like 40 bucks worth of drugs. And when his son was arrested, police kicked out Chris and his wife from the house and took it over. Chris and the Sourovelis family had to appear in court nine times to get their house back, and they could only get their house back once they agreed to change the locks and never let their son stay there.</p>
                        <p>34:04 Peter: It's illegal to have a cool son, I guess.</p>
                        <p>34:09 Michael: Another recent, particularly egregious example, was in Texas, where else.</p>
                        <p>34:16 Rhiannon: Of course.</p>
                        <p>34:16 Michael: Where this guy was driving along Highway 59, I guess he was speeding, he had someone with him in the car. A cop pulled him over, thought something didn't seem right with him, got a search warrant for the car, there was a safe in the back. The guy said it was his mom's, the passenger said something different. And so anyway, they open up this safe, they find $200,000 worth of cash and a bill of sale for a house in Pennsylvania. And the guy says, look, I told you it's my mom's, she sold her house in Pennsylvania, and these are the proceeds from the sale. The mom says the same exact thing. The cops say, no, it's drug contraband, and they seize the $200,000. The mom and the son go to fight it, they go to that proceeding. The mom is a fucking IRS agent. She works for the federal government and is saying, this is my money. I stopped holding my money in banks after the crash in 2008, and I don't trust them, so I put it in a safe. And on the other side of the ledger, a cop said, in my experience, people on that highway tend to be running drugs, and the court was like, I think the cop is right.</p>
                        <p>35:27 Michael: The preponderance of evidence suggests that these are drug contraband, this $200,000, it went up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court decided not to review it because they hadn't raised constitutional claims at the lowest levels, and so it wasn't properly presented for review.</p>
                        <p>35:44 Peter: That really put a dent in the common strategy of drug dealers to drive with your mom, to go sell drugs and to put all the money you're gonna use to buy 25 pounds of cocaine in a safe in your trunk.</p>
                        <p>36:01 Rhiannon: Right. It could be a cartoon, it's a fucking bank robber with a bag that has a money sign on it. Like yeah, that's what drug dealers do. Back to just the small forfeitures of smaller cash amounts, many of these forfeitures start with a traffic stop that results in some kind of search. Always, you have to go back to who is this happening the most to. And we know that people of color and the poor are going to be disproportionately pulled over, and we know that once there is a traffic stop initiated, people of color are going to be disproportionately searched. And so now imagine that some small amount of drugs or just bullshit cop suspicion results in $500 being taken from someone who might have like just cashed their check and their car that they used to go to work is taken from them too, that's what forfeiture looks like.</p>
                        <p>36:54 Rhiannon: And the police are incentivized to do it because there are no consequences for stealing on this scale for millions of people in the aggregate. This is a cash cow for local jurisdictions and courts side with them on it constantly. And almost, like I said up top, like automatically. One thing that further complicates and sort of makes this even more egregious is that states and municipalities and counties don't have a lot of accountability built into their civil forfeiture laws, so in a lot of places, just recently, due to investigative reporting and stuff like that, it's come out that prosecutors will dip into civil asset forfeiture funds to take vacations, to pay their secretary, to give everybody a nice holiday bonus.</p>
                        <p>37:44 Michael: Functionally indistinguishable from the Mob.</p>
                        <p>37:47 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>37:48 Michael: It's a protection racket.</p>
                        <p>37:50 Rhiannon: Stealing money and then like using it for their lifestyle, right. And taking care of...</p>
                        <p>37:55 Michael: Backed by the threat of violence.</p>
                        <p>37:55 Rhiannon: Exactly, exactly.</p>
                        <p>37:58 Michael: And I just quickly wanna note, it doesn't have to be this way, right? Like New Mexico, North Carolina and Nebraska do not have civil forfeiture. So shout out to them. Land of enchantment, good job. It's not all bad news on this front. Last year in 2019, the Court unanimously reined in civil forfeiture, at least to a certain degree. They held basically, that the Eighth Amendment applies to the states, and the Eighth Amendment has an excessive fines clause, and so they said, the excessive fines clause applies to asset forfeiture. In that case, it was like a guy who had, I think, just a little bit of pot on him or something, had his $35,000 SUV seized, and the court was saying that's an excessive fine. And that's good. That would help in some of the more egregious cases. It wouldn't help someone like Tina Bennis, whose car is only worth $600 and only has a $300 interest in it.</p>
                        <p>38:57 Michael: It wouldn't help pretty much anyone in more impoverished communities who take the brunt of this anyway, because the assets they have to be seized aren't worth that much in an objective sense that would implicate the excessive fines clause, but they're worth a lot to them. $500 is a lot for someone living on the edge.</p>
                        <p>39:16 Rhiannon: Exactly, that's right.</p>
                        <p>39:17 Peter: It is a check and it's an important check on them, but I think that this fight is far from over, and I think we'll see over the course of the next decade or so what the numbers actually look like. My guess is they won't change that much.</p>
                        <p>39:28 Rhiannon: Yeah, and as we wrap up, I have been thinking a lot about, there's a lot of emphasis throughout the opinion on the remedial nature of the Michigan statute, that the law in Michigan is designed to sort of remedy a wrong and do public good, and that's why it's okay. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is talking about equity and fairness, and they're doing all of that to say that this law is not designed to be punitive. Now, I just think that's a completely depraved and reductive view of what it means to punish somebody. These Justices can't imagine how punitive it is to have $1000 or your Honda Civic taken from you after being pulled over for jack shit, because it's never happened to them and it won't ever happen to them.</p>
                        <p>40:17 Rhiannon: And it comes down to what is evoked for the Justices when words like criminal activity and suspected crime are said. If the police think that you're doing something bad, then you're a different kind of person than me and my family, and whatever happens to you as a result, according to the Justices, it might be punishment, it might not be punishment, but the state can do it anyway.</p>
                        <p>40:40 Peter: Right. We should circle back to just how unlikely it is that this would ever be applied to the lives and communities of rich people. If you're a listener to our show, there's a decent chance you are a law student or a lawyer, decent chance you come from a fairly well-off community, how many kids you knew dealing weed in high school, in college, how many kids did you know that bought and in some way distributed cocaine in college or after college?</p>
                        <p>41:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, or Adderall, right.</p>
                        <p>41:13 Michael: And can you DM me their contact info.</p>
                        <p>41:15 Peter: Did it feel to you... Does it feel now like there was ever any significant risk that their parents' house would be taken away?</p>
                        <p>41:27 Rhiannon: Exactly. It's fucking absurd.</p>
                        <p>41:29 Peter: Of course not. This is something that happens to poor people, that's it. This is a system by which the government and police, in particular, literally siphon money out of poor communities. And they do it using the same justification that has been used throughout history in a thousand different contexts, by claiming that it's necessary in some way to maintain the peace. The link here between this woman and any criminal activity is essentially non-existent and an opportunity is being presented to the Court to address that. Both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide for broad protections of due process and property rights. There is absolutely no "correct" reading of the Amendments. Whether they protect against an imposition like this one is entirely a matter of whether the Justices can find a good reason to.</p>
                        <p>42:18 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>42:19 Peter: To me, the fact that she's being punished for something that she didn't do is a fundamentally compelling reason, it's a reason that should be enough to weigh on whether or not the Constitution needs to step in here and protect the person from the state. And this taps into a very important point about how conservatives conceptualize the law generally and the Constitution specifically. It was long the conservative position that the Constitution's purpose was to restrict the federal government rather than the states, and in fact, that was pretty much taken as a given until the Fourteenth Amendment was passed in the 1870s, after which there was a steady process of the Court holding that the various provisions of the Constitution's Bill of Rights applied to state governments too, the federal government couldn't do it to you, and neither could the states, but conservatives, especially from Rehnquist's generation, Rehnquist cuts his teeth in the '50s.</p>
                        <p>43:15 Peter: That's right after the cases that held that the Bill of Rights applied to the states came down, and conservatives in his generation were very wary of this, and they were much less willing to strike down encroachments on people's rights by states than by the federal government. And this is important because it shines a light on what conservatives believe the purpose of the Constitution is, not to protect your rights per se, but to constrain the federal government, and that often leads to decisions like this which grants states enormous leeway to impose upon their citizens. That's why it's necessary for a cohesive interpretation of the Constitution to account for context, to account for power and powerlessness.</p>
                        <p>44:00 Peter: Without that perspective, when you view the law as nothing more than a series of rules, you get the Court receiving a case about a woman whose car was seized by police and somehow discussing what the King of Spain was up to in 1827. It's inherently absurd, and it is an output of a philosophy of law that has completely decontextualized the practice and understanding of law from the people that it impacts.</p>

                        <p>44:34 Peter: So next week, we're gonna take a break. No show next week. A couple of weeks ago, Rhiannon had coronavirus, and we still recorded, but this is much more significant. I'm moving to Queens. So we'll see you in two weeks, and we're gonna do a 2019-2020 term wrap-up, what happened where it leaves us, what we can expect from the Court based on it.</p>
                        <p>45:02 Rhiannon: I'm gonna yell some cuss words, it's gonna be great.</p>
                        <p>45:05 Peter: Yeah, and we can talk about our new hero, John Roberts, sorry for everything we've said, You're doing so great, John. Follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod, tell your friends.</p>
                        <p>45:18 Michael: Tell your family.</p>

                        <p>01:26 Peter: And here we are...</p>
                        <p>01:26 Rhiannon: I was cooking in this closet.</p>
                        <p>01:29 Peter: Another miracle.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>[foreign language]</p>
                        <p>01:31 Michael: More proof.</p>
                        <p>01:32 Rhiannon: Thank you, God.</p>
                        <p>01:33 Michael: The liberals need to get over it and we need to just open it all up. It's nothing more than the flu.</p>
                        <p>01:39 Rhiannon: No, no, no, no. Don't let them mansplain COVID to you.</p>
                        <p>01:43 Peter: Today's case is Epic Systems v. Lewis. This is a case about whether employers can require employees to waive their right to class action lawsuits. So a couple of decades ago, a lot of employers started requiring their employees to sign arbitration agreements. Those agreements stated that employees could not sue their employer in court, instead they had to take any disputes to arbitration. It's a big advantage for employers. Not only is arbitration less expensive than traditional litigation, but employers are considerably more likely to win in arbitration, and when employees win, they are generally awarded lower damages.</p>
                        <p>02:21 Peter: So not long after these agreements became popular, employers started putting in what are called class action waivers, stating that not only do you have to arbitrate your claims outside of court, but you cannot take part in a class action lawsuit against the company. So these arbitration agreements are doing two things: One is they are keeping you out of court and forcing you to resolve any disputes in front of an arbitrator with your employer; and two, they are forcing you to waive your rights to participate in a class action, whether that be in court or in front of an arbitrator, so that you have to pursue your claim individually.</p>
                        <p>03:00 Peter: These are often included in your employment agreement when you first start working. Sometimes employers roll them out later and send out an email saying, "If you don't respond, we're gonna assume that you have acknowledged and accepted this." So as a result, these class action waivers effectively prevent workers from vindicating their rights at all and allow employers to get away with smaller scale wage theft without repercussion. The legal issue in this case, we'll get to in a bit, but it's about two laws, the National Labor Relations Act and the Federal Arbitration Act. But what this case is really about is how conservatives on the Court have selectively weaponized the idea of workers' choice to use it against the workers themselves and to the benefit of massive corporations.</p>
                        <p>03:43 Rhiannon: Yes. Is this the first case we're covering where a majority is written by Justice Gorsuch?</p>
                        <p>03:49 Peter: If you don't count Bostock County...</p>
                        <p>03:51 Rhiannon: Oh, oh, yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:53 Peter: The Title VII case, the win.</p>
                        <p>03:54 Michael: The good one.</p>
                        <p>03:56 Peter: But this is the first case we are very critically covering by our boy, Neil Gorsuch, who's just turned 23 today, I believe.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:06 Peter: Happy birthday, Neil.</p>
                        <p>04:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, he is a little baby angel on the Supreme Court, isn't he?</p>
                        <p>04:11 Peter: This is a 5-4 case. This is right before Kennedy retires and Kavanaugh takes his place on the Court. One of the first major Gorsuch decisions. Gorsuch, in my view, a very tedious writer.</p>
                        <p>04:22 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>04:24 Peter: Obviously, he's trying to imitate Antonin Scalia.</p>
                        <p>04:28 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>04:28 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>04:28 Rhiannon: He wants to be cute.</p>
                        <p>04:28 Peter: He tries to do these logical gotchas all the time, and he's not good at it. It's very unsettling to read.</p>
                        <p>04:34 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:35 Michael: And he tries to get that quippy clever writing, but it comes off as just like doltish.</p>
                        <p>04:42 Rhiannon: It's like a knock-knock joke. You're just like, "Oh, really, you got me." [laughter] I also really respect that... Peter, thank you so much for continuing to say his name wrong. Never fixing that.</p>
                        <p>04:54 Peter: I don't believe that it is wrong.</p>
                        <p>04:55 Michael: It's a real conundrum.</p>
                        <p>04:55 Peter: I've never heard him say it.</p>
                        <p>04:56 Rhiannon: He said it in his confirmation hearing.</p>
                        <p>04:58 Peter: I didn't watch that. I'm not out here...</p>
                        <p>05:00 Rhiannon: Like I said, I respect it. You're good.</p>
                        <p>05:02 Peter: A long time ago, someone told me that I'm saying Gorsuch wrong. And I was like, "You know what? That just doesn't matter to me. I'm gonna keep going."</p>
                        <p>05:10 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, who cares?</p>
                        <p>05:13 Peter: One other thing I want to say about this case. This is the first case where I have something that looks loosely like an expertise. I've practiced some employment law litigation in my day. So anything...</p>
                        <p>05:23 Rhiannon: Oh, is that right? On whose side? Oh, we're just going past that.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>05:27 Peter: Whoever paid me the most, Rhi. [laughter] I just want to note that any time in the past 21 episodes that you heard something that sounded like expertise, that's not what that was, I was faking that, but this time it's real. So Rhi, walk us through some background here.</p>
                        <p>05:46 Rhiannon: Okay. Yes. What's up, haters? You thought that I was gonna die? I'm not.</p>
                        <p>05:51 Michael: Congrats.</p>
                        <p>05:52 Rhiannon: I'm gonna die from other reasons. [chuckle] One day. Before we get into the specific facts of this case, it makes sense, I think, to talk about the history of how these laws that are at issue in Epic Systems get passed and why we have them. So the early 1900s were an absolutely wild time for capitalism in the United States. So you technically couldn't have slaves anymore, but industry was like, "Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll call you an employee rather than my property, but I will not recognize that you have any rights." And the Supreme Court during that time is 100% cool with it. In fact, they completely make up a fake right to support bosses and this kind of laissez-faire economic philosophy. And over the course of a few decades, from the late 1890s into the 1930s, the Supreme Court hands down several cases defending the so-called freedom of contract.</p>
                        <p>06:53 Michael: Is there anything that happened in the 1930s?</p>
                        <p>06:55 Rhiannon: You know what, Michael, we're gonna get to that.</p>
                        <p>06:57 Michael: Okay, sorry.</p>
                        <p>06:58 Rhiannon: But right now, it's all about the bosses and their freedom of contract.</p>
                        <p>07:02 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:02 Rhiannon: So the Supreme Court is saying that economic liberty and the right of parties to enter into private contracts, that's like a substantive right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>07:14 Michael: So insane.</p>
                        <p>07:16 Rhiannon: Yeah, and this period in the Court's history is referred to as the Lochner era. It's named after a case that's called Lochner that happened kind of at the beginning of this time.</p>
                        <p>07:25 Michael: And as a reminder to our listeners, the Fourteenth Amendment was one of those Civil War Amendments that was like, "Hey, freed slaves, they have equal rights." And the Court is like, "Yeah, free slaves have equal rights to enter into a contract for indentured servitude." That's the Constitution talking.</p>
                        <p>07:43 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>07:43 Peter: This is such like an American mind disease thing.</p>
                        <p>07:46 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>07:47 Peter: Right? Where it's just like, somehow the American mind took like the independence of the frontier spirit and turned it into this thing where they're like, "Yeah, child labor. You should be able to do that too because of freedom." Taking an amendment that is meant to empower freed slaves and turning it into something that is a weapon for industry, some of the most American shit of all time.</p>
                        <p>08:08 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>08:08 Rhiannon: Yeah, just fucking classic. So during this era of economic and constitutional interpretation, of course what happens is working conditions and terms of employment are violent and menacing and employers are being protected anyways. So children can be forced to work. You can be forced to work seven days a week with no minimum wage. You can be fired for organizing into a union. And the Supreme Court says, "That's good, 'cause actually, that's freedom." And importantly, observers at the time note that when employers can prohibit employees from collective bargaining, the laboring man is left "absolutely helpless" because it is requiring that he present any grievance he has with the employer in a completely individual and therefore powerless capacity. That's important for the case that we're gonna talk about.</p>
                        <p>09:02 Rhiannon: Things finally got better in the 1930s, which is when Congress finally passed legislation to protect workers' rights. The NLRA, the National Labor Relations Act, and other similar legislation is passed by Congress over the course of the early 1930s. The country had just gone through the Great Depression, of course. And the point of passing these laws is to say, "Hmm, actually, this maybe isn't the way we want the economy to run." And so, it's taking literal acts of Congress, but what Congress is finally saying in response to the Supreme Court acting crazy like this, is that workers should be allowed to take collective action because the power imbalance between employee and employer is obvious and workers should be protected.</p>
                        <p>09:45 Michael: I'm glad that we have learned the lessons of history and have realized that just unfettered capitalism without any workers' rights can only lead to ruin.</p>
                        <p>09:58 Rhiannon: Yup, we're good now.</p>
                        <p>09:58 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:58 Rhiannon: The NLRA guarantees employees the right to self-organization, to form labor organizations and to engage in other concerted activities for those purposes. And additionally, it prohibits employers from interfering with, restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of those rights, those rights to association and organization. To enforce the provisions of the NLRA, the statute also created the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, to administer labor policy for the nation. And just a historical note about how the Supreme Court responded to the NLRA, after the NLRA is passed, a couple of cases come up to the Supreme Court challenging the new labor protective laws. And this time, the Court upholds the protections. So the Lochner era is said to have ended then, and the substantive right to contract is said to be a product of a totally bygone era, supposedly.</p>
                        <p>10:55 Michael: I think it's worth noting that like this switch in the Supreme Court's ideology is largely credited to threats from FDR of packing the Court, of like, "If you don't bless this new administrative state that we're creating, I'm just gonna expand the size of the Court to 15 or whatever. I'm gonna put in a bunch of Justices who agree with me. Your opinions won't matter anymore." And so the Court was like, "Okay, we're just gonna say it."</p>
                        <p>11:24 Rhiannon: Okay, I agree with you now, really good point. Turning now to the facts of this case, Epic Systems, which you may be surprised to hear, did not happen in the early 1900s, but actually in the year of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, 2018.</p>
                        <p>11:40 Peter: Hold on. Is that how you refer to the year of the prophet? So you just use the regular calendar?</p>
                        <p>11:45 Rhiannon: I'm just doing a play on the year of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>11:47 Peter: Well, that's because that's the year of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>11:49 Rhiannon: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>11:49 Peter: It dates to Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:53 Rhiannon: Okay, so actually this case did not happen in the early 1900s, but actually in the year 2018.</p>
                        <p>12:01 Peter: Okay, before you get into the details here, I want to contextualize this a little bit. You have the National Labor Relations Act passed in the 1930s, and it bolsters the ability of workers to unionize, to otherwise organize, and that continues for several decades where union activity is high. And in the '70s, it starts to fade for various reasons, like workers generally sort of lose their power. And a part of this is some legal strategies employed by management, one of which is leaning on the Federal Arbitration Act. The Federal Arbitration Act is a law that basically just says that arbitration agreements need to be enforced according to their terms. And what the companies started saying was that, "What this means is that if we enter into an arbitration agreement with our workers, those arbitration agreements can't be infringed by the courts, by Congress, by whomever."</p>
                        <p>13:02 Peter: And the result of it is that these large companies utilize arbitration agreements to sort of impose their will upon workers. They start to build in these clauses that you can no longer bring class action lawsuits against your employers. And as a result, we are sort of seeing the return of the same type of argument that dominated in the Lochner era, where the contract rights are being held above the rights of labor to collectively organize.</p>
                        <p>13:32 Rhiannon: Exactly. Epic Systems is actually a consolidation of three separate cases that came up through their federal court system at about the same time, and they sort of presented generally the same issues about whether the NLRA trumps the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
                        <p>13:49 Rhiannon: In the named case, Epic Systems versus Lewis, employee Jacob Lewis sued his employer, a software company called Epic Systems, after he signed a new employee policy that required individual arbitration in any employment disputes. And even though he signed the new policy, Lewis and other technical writers at Epic Systems said that the company was violating the Fair Labor Standards Act by not properly paying them overtime wages. So they filed a class action lawsuit, and the company in response is saying, "No, court, we want the employees' arbitration agreements to be enforced and you should dismiss the case because the employees signed a contract saying they wouldn't file class action lawsuits."</p>
                        <p>14:34 Rhiannon: The second of the three consolidated cases involves the huge international accounting firm, Ernst and Young. Two employees of Ernst and Young filed a class action on behalf of all Ernst and Young employees in California, alleging that they also were not being properly paid overtime wages. In that case, Ernst and Young responds the same way. These employees, they say, signed contracts, saying they would not enter class action suits, and they would instead individually arbitrate these kinds of claims. And in the third case, a gas station employee named Sheila Hobson sued the oil company, Murphy Oil, saying that she shouldn't be forced to arbitrate her claims if she had Fair Labor Standards complaints as well. She wanted to go to court rather than arbitrate.</p>
                        <p>15:21 Peter: So the legal question here is, how do these two laws work together, the National Labor Relations Act and the Federal Arbitration Act. The Federal Arbitration Act says that arbitration agreements must be enforced according to their terms. In this case, workers have signed away their right to class action and arbitration. But the National Labor Relations Act, the NLRA, guarantees employees the right to engage in "concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection."</p>
                        <p>15:53 Rhiannon: Yeah, also, it might be referred to as collective action or collective bargaining.</p>
                        <p>15:57 Peter: And the law prohibits employers from interfering with that right. And so the argument is that although the Federal Arbitration Act states that arbitration agreements must be enforced, employees can't be made to waive their class action rights under the NLRA because it would interfere with their right to work collectively with one another to represent their interests. But the Court says, "No, no, no. The National Labor Relations Act does not protect class action rights, and therefore, you have to enforce the class action waivers."</p>
                        <p>16:29 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:30 Rhiannon: Yeah, just to make it clear, though, what the Supreme Court is interpreting in this case is how two federal laws work together. There is not a constitutional question in this case, so the Supreme Court is not deciding something based on the Constitution. And I kind of just want to play out a little bit just in terms of my own understanding, like what being forced to arbitrate as an employee, like what that kind of looks like versus being able to take your claim to court and do... Like, what you would think of as a traditional litigation route. In college, I worked for a restaurant, I waited tables. They often shorted me on my paycheck, but over the course of like what, six months, it was probably a total of $300. And so, they did this to a ton of the staff, right?</p>
                        <p>17:16 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:16 Rhiannon: So what does it look like if we could sue as a class versus being forced to individually arbitrate?</p>
                        <p>17:23 Peter: Yeah, I mean it's fairly simple to describe class actions. Lawyers would find a problem that they think might have a bunch of victims, and you kind of try to communicate with all of them and get them to sign some agreements and represent all of them in the class action, and you can recover all of the money owed to all of them at once, and you split it amongst everyone who's part of the lawsuit. Arbitration, you have an arbitrator, that's just some organization that does this, like the American Arbitration Association is one of them, and they all have an arbitrator for you, and you go before them, and the procedures are much less complex, your options are much narrower, and the arbitrators themselves tend to be from industries that are sympathetic to employers.</p>
                        <p>18:08 Peter: And as a result, not only are you less likely to win and more likely to win less even when you do win, but the cost of the actual arbitration is super low for the employers.</p>
                        <p>18:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, so if I had gone to my employer, I'm sure there was a similar clause about arbitration. It's not only that I would be limited from doing a class action lawsuit or suing them the traditional way in court, but I would have to arbitrate by the terms that they also set out in the arbitration clause of that contract. So they might say that I have to go through certain arbitrators, they might say that arbitration has to happen in a certain state that's not my home state. What else?</p>
                        <p>18:49 Peter: It can be governed by one state's laws rather than another. They can pick a favorable state's laws and have them apply.</p>
                        <p>18:56 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:56 Rhiannon: So if I was shorted about $300 by the restaurant, it would have cost more for me to take that claim to arbitration than I would have ever recovered, right?</p>
                        <p>19:06 Peter: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So if you file a class action in court, there's a filing fee of a few hundred bucks, but that's generally gonna be paid by the attorneys on behalf of the whole class. If you go to arbitration, there is also a filing fee. It's not huge. It varies from arbitrator to arbitrator, but we're definitely talking about a couple hundred bucks at least. So you would have to pay a fee that is worth as much, if not more, than your actual claim. All of which to say, there's absolutely no reason to do it in those circumstances.</p>
                        <p>19:40 Peter: I think this is a pretty good time for an ad.</p>
                        <p>19:44 Peter: Alright, this case is a good example of the standard conservative approach to workers' rights. Whenever the balance of power between employers and employees is questioned, conservatives on the Court will say that it's an issue of workers' choice, that is, workers have the right to sign or not sign these agreements, as they see fit. That of course ignores the massive imbalance of power between employers and employees. So, again, the NLRA, the National Labor Relations Act, protects employees who, "engage in concerted activities for the purpose of mutual aid or protection."</p>
                        <p>20:20 Peter: So the argument from us would be that the phrase "other concerted activities" has historically been interpreted very broadly and should probably include class action lawsuits, but Gorsuch says that it doesn't. Now, there's no doubt that engaging in a class action lawsuit is a "concerted activity" in the literal sense, but Gorsuch applies a principle of interpretation called... I think I'm gonna butcher this, but ejusdem generis.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:48 Michael: Yeah, no, I think that's right, ejusdem generis.</p>
                        <p>20:51 Peter: Which means that where there is a list of specific words followed by a general word, you interpret the general word in the context of those specific words. For example, if I said cars, motorcycles, buses and other vehicles, you probably wouldn't interpret other vehicles to include space ships, it's just a little outside of the boundaries of the prior parts of that list. And so he's saying that this law protects "self-organization, forming unions, collective bargaining and other concerted activities," and that the other concerted activities part needs to be read to only include similar union-specific activities, but not class actions. And the problem with this logic is that the phrase "other concerted activities" is obviously just a catch-all, it's a broad term in a statute that has the broad purpose of protecting the ability of workers to collectively protect and vindicate their rights.</p>
                        <p>21:48 Peter: So if you want to argue that the term "other concerted activities" does not mean what it literally says, you should have a pretty specific and concrete reason for doing that. But Gorsuch doesn't have that. Instead, he has this vague and easily manipulated principle of statutory interpretation, which he uses to artificially limit the scope of the statute. The law protects concerted activity, class action is literally a concerted activity, so the conservatives who claim to rely on the text of the law have to create a textual interpretation where they replace the literal meaning and just say what they feel like it means.</p>
                        <p>22:25 Michael: Right. And these sorts of canons, the textual canons, like ejusdem generis, there are, I think, over a hundred of them that the Court likes to cite to, that are like little rules of how to read statutes.</p>
                        <p>22:38 Rhiannon: Law school fucking rots your brain.</p>
                        <p>22:41 Peter: It really does. It really does.</p>
                        <p>22:41 Rhiannon: It's bad.</p>
                        <p>22:42 Michael: And this won't be the first time ever I refer to like 1950s academics, but there's one named Karl Llewellyn who had a list of canons of construction, and then he had a list of counter canons and how they could basically cancel each other out and a judge can just pick and choose which canons get them where they want to be, so it's all just rhetorical bullshit is the thing to remember.</p>
                        <p>23:06 Peter: Absolutely. Another thing that's legally important here is that the Federal Arbitration Act, which again says that arbitration agreements need to be enforced according to their terms, but the NLRA, if you buy our argument, says that you can't use those agreements to have employees waive their class action rights. So these statutes conflict, assuming that we are right and we are. Gorsuch brings in another principle of statutory interpretation, that courts should try to interpret statutes so that they don't conflict, basically arguing that you want to keep the National Labor Relations Act narrow, just so it doesn't conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act. This principle that you should read statutes in ways that avoids conflict never really made sense to me, at least not as a general rule.</p>
                        <p>23:53 Peter: It treats laws as if Congress is like designing them to fit perfectly together like a puzzle. But in reality, Congress from one law to the next, from one decade to the next, is completely different, we're just talking about completely different goals, and so I think a lot of laws conflict with one another, and if it seems like they do, you need to think about why they conflict and then give purpose and effect to those laws in ways that make substantive sense. All of this statutory interpretation bullshit obscures the true issue here.</p>
                        <p>24:27 Peter: The entire purpose of the National Labor Relations Act is to address unequal bargaining power between employees and management. Gorsuch starts this opinion by saying workers should be allowed to choose whether they enter into these agreements, but you can't discuss worker choice without discussing the fact that employers have enormous leverage over employees in most negotiations. Employees need jobs to survive, and that means that turning one down literally poses an existential risk to most workers. And when you're talking about arbitration agreements and class action waivers, you have to account for the fact that a high percentage of employers use them, so if you decide that you won't agree to them, you're not just turning down one job, you're turning down a huge number of jobs. In some industries, essentially every employer or actually every employer implements these provisions, so saying that you choose not to agree with them would write you out of working in those industries entirely.</p>
                        <p>25:23 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. To go back to my experience waiting tables, yeah, I guess I could have refused to take a job with that restaurant chain, but I needed a job, and there weren't other options for having this job where all my legal rights would be easily vindicated because there's this other option for working for somebody who doesn't have these bullshit clauses in their employment contracts.</p>
                        <p>25:48 Peter: This imbalance between employees and employers is the entire purpose of the NLRA, and that's why I think Gorsuch's framing gives away how bad faith his opinion is here. He says that this is a matter of workers' choice, without acknowledging and addressing that the whole point of the NLRA is to account for unequal bargaining power between workers and management. And as we mentioned in our Janus episode, just a couple of episodes ago, conservatives will often weaponize the idea of choice to obscure these imbalances and, like we mentioned earlier, I think that these arguments, they only work in this country because they are targeting a deep part of the American ethos, the idea that people should be allowed to choose. It's really, really hitting the center of the American brain. These arguments are effective here in ways that they're not in other countries at all, which is probably why American labor law is so fucking terrible.</p>
                        <p>26:41 Rhiannon: And I just want to make a quick point about Justice Gorsuch and his legal background before he was a Justice on the Supreme Court. So he starts his legal career at this firm called Kellogg Huber, which is known as this uber elite sort of boutique litigation firm, and while he was there, back in 2005, he wrote in a brief denouncing class actions that "the problem is that securities fraud litigation imposes an enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another, and costing businesses billions of dollars in settlements every year." Now, that's about securities class actions specifically, but note that the problem that he's pointing out is the cost to corporations of litigating class actions and not the cost to our society for securities fraud.</p>
                        <p>27:39 Michael: Yeah. My poor baby Frito Lays is taking a big hit and I need to protect it.</p>
                        <p>27:48 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:49 Michael: The thing here is, it's not just that conservatives are hypocritical in the way they deploy their concern for workers' choice, though they are, nor is it just that they're using the idea of workers' choice here in a particularly bullshitty way, though that is also true. [chuckle] The thing is that all of these negotiations that they're talking about takes place in sort of the shadow of the state and its coercive power, and that's not just to say the Federal Arbitration Act and the National Labor Relations Act and whatever else shape these negotiations, though they do, but very basic, fundamental policy choices, like whether to live in a capitalist or a communist or a socialist society, choices that are then enforced with the power of the state, shape this.</p>
                        <p>28:42 Michael: You know, the question of whether you even need to work to get food is a basic policy question that like Andrew Yang, who's a proponent of universal basic income, might say, you shouldn't. And that would change your bargaining position, right? So what's happening here is not a question about whether or not workers have choice, that's hiding the state's role by putting this on the workers. The question is, how do we distribute the state's power of coercion and on whose behalf should we be concerned?</p>
                        <p>29:16 Peter: Yeah, we don't even need to use universal basic income. You can imagine a more robust welfare state putting people in a position where they might be able to turn down jobs more readily if they believe that they are agreeing to something that would negatively impact them down the road. There are a thousand ways in which government policy dictates the fact that employees don't have much of a choice here.</p>
                        <p>29:43 Michael: Right. And look, if the last discussion felt like a little too sort of theoretical, I think right now, COVID makes this all feel very concrete. It's obviously a very precarious situation out there, but there are some cities that are like cancelling rent or putting freezes on evictions. There were bills in Congress to give people $2000 a month, which would help them pay rent and buy food. And you can imagine a world where your city froze rent and where you're getting $1000 or $2000 a month from the government, and in that world, maybe you're not willing to accept unsafe conditions from Amazon, you're not willing to be forced to go tend bar in some crowded bar where people aren't wearing masks and there's no social distancing.</p>
                        <p>30:35 Michael: And on the other hand, people who are living in the current situation, if they're on the verge of getting evicted, they're not free to bargain for a better arbitration agreement. Like are you fucking kidding me? Like it's an absurd idea. These are the choices that we make as a society, and that the Supreme Court is hiding when they talk about worker choice and negotiation and all that bullshit that they fill these opinions with.</p>
                        <p>31:03 Peter: Right. So the result of this decision is very clear. Employers can now require as a condition of employment that employees forfeit their right to a class action. So it's important that we talk about what this means in practice. We've covered some of this, but class actions have a lot of value. What makes them really irreplaceable is in circumstances where a large number of people have each sustained a small amount of damage. A large company fails to pay certain wages to a bunch of employees. In those cases, as we mentioned, often not worth it for a single employee to bring a lawsuit, but if you can act collectively, it makes sense to do it.</p>
                        <p>31:38 Peter: So the function here is that companies will now get away with wage theft because employees have no realistic means to recover their money. If you get screwed out of $700, it's rarely gonna be worth your time and energy to try to recover it, even if that means making next month's rent, putting food on your kid's table, etcetera. And if you think this is a minor problem, know that wage theft in the United States accounts for the vast majority of theft in the country. The Economic Policy Institute in 2014 calculated the combined cost of minimum wage, overtime, rest break and off-the-clock violations at about $40 billion per year. By contrast, larceny just over $5 billion, robbery, about $4 billion. So what we're talking about is a problem that dwarfs traditional forms of theft.</p>
                        <p>32:26 Rhiannon: Yes, I'm always gonna be obsessed with what the criminal law analogue is to all of this. We have very intense criminal laws that address when somebody does theft, when an individual does theft. My clients face terms of years or their lives for robbing somebody.</p>
                        <p>32:52 Michael: The more violent crimes, right?</p>
                        <p>32:54 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>32:54 Michael: Right, but I think wage theft is violent. It's just a hidden violence, right? It's the violence of not having a roof over your head or not having something to eat, or being denied those things.</p>
                        <p>33:08 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's what violence that we choose as a society to condemn. It's also about who does which kind of theft, right? People of color are, by and large, not the owners of large corporations. People of color can be arrested and punished harshly for the individual kind of theft that our criminal laws address.</p>
                        <p>33:29 Michael: Right, the victims of this are the people that we as a society turn our eyes away from. And so injustices aimed at them don't have this sort of visceral impact, it's just not as visible for us.</p>
                        <p>33:43 Rhiannon: Yep, exactly. One thing to think about it and talk about the impact is that the minor wage stuff that I experienced as a restaurant employee, that was remedied, not by having to go to court, but because I have the ability to look at my paycheck and know what I should have been paid, calculate the difference, and also just be a vocal employee and take it to my boss immediately, but if you think about the impact that that might have on somebody who, for example, is undocumented or anybody who might not have, say, the requisite literacy skills or just the power to approach a boss and to say, I think there's something wrong and I think that you owe me money.</p>
                        <p>34:28 Michael: And I also want to add, when I bused tables and tended bar, I never even thought to look at my paycheck to compare my hours and pick my tips, I was just like, alright, this was a slow week or this was a fast week or even if it seemed low I'd just be like, man, it sucks. And the idea of being like, "I think my boss is shorting me," that never once crossed my mind and I never once heard any of my co-workers talking about it.</p>
                        <p>34:56 Rhiannon: Yeah. Oh, hey, we should go to an ad.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Peter: Alright, I think putting this case in its historical context is important. The Federal Arbitration Act is passed in 1925, I believe, because some lawyers' associations thought it would be useful for old-timey merchants to be able to agree to avoid litigation. I think you guys know me well enough to know that I love to imagine old-timey business, and so I'm picturing 100 years ago, all of business, it was just one guy, he would have a wheelbarrow full of coal, and another guy would be like, "I'll give you seven candles for it," and he's like, "You got yourself a deal there, buddy, but I would like to agree to arbitration," and he was like, "Yes, we must avoid the purity of traditional litigation." [laughter]</p>
                        <p>35:45 Peter: That's the milieu in which the Federal Arbitration Act exists. Now, there's like three employers in the country, it's Amazon and Walmart and Goldman Sachs, and they are just raining down like arbitration hell fire upon innocent workers, and the Court is acting as if you can just treat the statute the same way. The statute wasn't always viewed this broadly, the Federal Arbitration Act. In the past several decades, the Court has turned this sort of like archaic law into what I think is one of the most powerful laws in the country.</p>
                        <p>36:16 Peter: Here we have the Court functionally casting aside a broad law protecting labor rights. In other cases, the Court has held that states can't even pass laws restricting arbitration. Several states tried to make class action waivers illegal, but the court claimed that those laws must be struck down because they conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act, and that the Federal Arbitration Act overrides them.</p>
                        <p>36:40 Rhiannon: Yeah, when we're talking about this, I feel like Allen Iverson in the, "We talking about practice" interview, like, wait a second, we're talking about arbitration right now? Are you fucking kidding me? No, no, no, no, I thought we were talking about wage theft. I thought we were talking about overtime pay, no, we're talking about arbitration? This is bullshit.</p>
                        <p>37:01 Peter: And to give you a sense of how expanded this law has become, as recently as 20 years ago, it wasn't even clear that the Federal Arbitration Act applied to employees. In fact, the literal reading of the law makes it fairly clear, in my view, that it doesn't, but the Court inexplicably held in a 2001 case called Circuit City v. Adams, that it does, paving the way for decisions like Epic Systems, so the Supreme Court has injected life into the corpse of this 100-year-old statute to the point where it applies in contexts that no one previously thought it did and can nullify any state or federal laws that conflict with it.</p>
                        <p>37:38 Rhiannon: And just to go back to how the Lochner era is viewed now, everyone on the Supreme Court agrees, and will say that the Lochner era is a bad time in Supreme Court history. Conservatives are famously against judicial activism. John Roberts himself, the umpire himself, during his confirmation hearings, said, "You go to a case like the Lochner case, you can read that opinion today, and it's quite clear that they're not interpreting the law, they're making the law," and I think Ruth Bader Ginsburg in dissent in this case, in Epic Systems, she does a really good job of saying that what the majority is doing is some Lochner era bullshit, and it harkens back to this recognition of the fake freedom of contract, but it's worth emphasizing that conservatives today, they now know that publicly they're supposed to say they're against the Lochner era judicial activism, but they will still employ it, obviously.</p>
                        <p>38:35 Michael: The mode of constitutional interpretation that the Court engaged in at the turn of the last century has been just completely discredited, and very few people will defend it. So what you have here is the current Supreme Court trying to reimpose the norms and the values that were evident in those decisions, but doing it pursuant to its powers of statutory interpretation. Rather than citing to the freedom of contract, they are building in these ideas of worker choice and freedom and negotiation into these statutory interpretation questions in a way that ends up recreating those economic conditions.</p>
                        <p>39:22 Peter: And probably a good time to note, we're not really talking about the dissent here mostly, 'cause the dissent's good, Ginsburg has a pretty strong dissent here, one of the better ones that she's written in the past several years, so nothing to say about it. Thanks for doing your job, Ruth.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>39:37 Rhiannon: For once, Ruth. Ruth had the smelling salts that day in Court and was like...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>39:47 Peter: So I want to talk about some later developments. There's been some fairly interesting reactions to the decision. Several companies, namely Google and Facebook gave into internal and public relations pressure and got rid of their class action waivers. Those companies don't employ a lot of low wage workers who are most impacted by it, so it's not the biggest deal in my mind, but certainly interesting that there has been a coordinated and successful at times PR effort against these. Maybe the most interesting and positive development was the tactic employed in the DoorDash case.</p>
                        <p>40:21 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>40:21 Peter: Even before this decision came down, there was talk amongst plaintiffs' attorneys of using class action waivers against employers by organizing employees and having them file hundreds or thousands of individual arbitrations, the burden of which would be greater than any class action. And after Epic Systems comes down, they actually did it. DoorDash is a food delivery service app, and they're sued by drivers who claim that they should have been treated as employees, but were actually treated like independent contractors, so they sued for wages and benefits, but class actions are forbidden under the arbitration agreements they all signed. So the drivers went ahead and filed over 5000 individual arbitration claims.</p>
                        <p>41:07 Rhiannon: It's so bad ass.</p>
                        <p>41:08 Peter: The result of this is that DoorDash not only has to individually defend all of them, but each arbitration costs DoorDash a fee, leaving them with $12 million in fees right off the bat before the case is even started.</p>
                        <p>41:22 Rhiannon: Beautiful. [chuckle] Beautiful.</p>
                        <p>41:24 Peter: Ironically enough, DoorDash, they get desperate and they request a class action which the judge not only rejected but outright mocked because, of course, they had forced their employees to agree that they would not use class action. A similar tactic was used against Uber last year. Tens of thousands of drivers filing individually and Uber reportedly being forced to settle the vast majority of the claims. This stuff isn't a cure to the problem that this case created, it takes a lot of effort, a lot of coordination and money to pull this tactic off. This stuff is all spearheaded by plaintiffs' attorneys who generally belong to large plaintiff-side firms. It's an enormous effort. That said, while you can't expect it to be used with any frequency, this tactic has caused a lot of large companies to re-evaluate whether or not class action waivers are worth it, and I'm sure are something right now that management side attorneys are figuring out what kind of fucking cheap loophole they can utilize to shut this down.</p>
                        <p>42:28 Peter: For now, though, a lot of the big players in this space, the Amazons, the Ubers, the Lyfts of the world that are reliant upon contractor labor to a large degree, they are all very nervous about this tactic, and it has sort of changed their approach here. Some rare good news to wrap up the episode.</p>
                        <p>42:48 Rhiannon: Get their asses.</p>
                        <p>42:50 Michael: Direct action works.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>42:56 Peter: Next week is Bennis v. Michigan, a case about civil forfeiture, which is the rights of cops to roll up on you and be like, "What are you holding?" And you'd be like, "It's my phone," and they would just take it. That's probably a slight over-simplification, but learn more next week.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>00:01 [Archival]: We'll hear arguments today in Buckley against Valeo and others.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:12 Leon: Hey, everyone. This is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Buckley v. Valeo, a case that is the basis of modern campaign finance law. It's also the ruling that cemented the notion that money is speech, effectively giving those with more money a louder voice in politics.</p>
                        <p>00:33 [Archival]: Another decision yesterday from the Supreme Court essentially saying, "Free speech means you can spend almost whatever you want on campaigns."</p>
                        <p>00:39 [Archival]: I think that's a terrible decision, spending money is not speech.</p>
                        <p>00:45 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:54 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court decisions that have borne down on Americans like unfiltered ultra-violet light on a pale nude body. [laughter] I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy, I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:13 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:16 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:16 Rhiannon: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:16 Peter: And today we are talking about Buckley v. Valeo. It's Valeo, right?</p>
                        <p>01:20 Rhiannon: Valeo.</p>
                        <p>01:22 Michael: I learned it Valeo in law school.</p>
                        <p>01:25 Rhiannon: No, it's Valeo, I'm just crazy.</p>
                        <p>01:25 Michael: You got it.</p>
                        <p>01:26 Peter: That's the kind of podcast we're on, "Do I know for sure?" No. "Did I look it up?" Also no.</p>
                        <p>01:31 Michael: You gotta forgive Rhiannon, her brain is currently on fire.</p>
                        <p>01:33 Rhiannon: That's right. We're operating above 100 degrees right now.</p>
                        <p>01:36 Peter: Not very long ago, we told you guys that if one of us got coronavirus and died, we would keep doing the podcast, and that was our promise to you. No one has died yet, but Rhiannon does appear, based on what we understand about COVID-19, to have it, and as the possible death and replacement of Rhiannon gets closer, we're gonna take a more somber tone, but we will keep going with the podcast. I can't back off that now, it's a promise I made on a podcast. That's legally binding.</p>
                        <p>02:09 Rhiannon: Not yet, bitches. The white devil has not gotten me yet, and I'm here to stay.</p>
                        <p>02:14 Peter: Yeah, the asterisk is that Rhiannon can never die.</p>
                        <p>02:16 Rhiannon: Correct, that's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:21 Peter: In our second episode, we covered Citizens United and there, we focused on the Court granting certain speech rights to corporations. This case, Buckley v. Valeo, is the most important precursor to Citizens United and is famous for crystallizing the idea that the expenditure of money is speech, more specifically that political spending, is it self-protectable speech under the First Amendment? This principle runs into a very obvious issue, which is that it essentially means that the amount of speech you have depends on the amount of money you have, and that presents a very fundamental problem with how the Court views freedom of speech. It often looks at speech issues in a vacuum rather than addressing what it means for the average citizen to have freedom of speech, whether one citizen's freedom to speak by spending money might impact another person's speech and why one person might have access to more speech than another.</p>
                        <p>03:19 Peter: So this is a case about campaign finance, and the Court here held several things. Namely it held that restrictions on contributions to political campaigns are fine and constitutional because they are designed to prevent corruption, but that independent expenditures, meaning spending by individual citizens who are not donating directly to a campaign, could not be capped and neither could spending by candidates themselves.</p>
                        <p>03:45 Michael: Right. So in terms of the things we're talking about in this episode, because of corruption concerns, it's fine for Congress to place limits on what I can give to a candidate. So $1000 was the cap then, I think, and now it's $2800 or something like that. At the same time, it's saying that what in campaign finance is called independent expenditures are unlimited, and there are countless examples of that. The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, everyone older than Zoomers might remember was this group that just did nothing but slam John Kerry in 2004 and call him a coward and a liar and said he stealing valor and all this shit.</p>
                        <p>04:33 Peter: And they were running their own independent ads separate from the Bush campaign.</p>
                        <p>04:37 Michael: Right. They were not a part of the Bush campaign, they weren't paid by the Bush campaign, but they were effectively, for all intents and purposes, an arm of the campaign. All they did was just trash a fucking veteran who had gotten a Purple Heart and call him a fucking liar. That's one example. Another would be the Koch brothers, who have built an entire country-wide network of political operatives, where they buy ads, they knock on doors, they flyer neighborhoods, they're like their own political party unto themselves, and oftentimes that's in service of electing Republicans, most often, and sometimes they side with the left on some weird libertarian issues. But that's independent, they're not funding the Republican National Committee and they're not funding Mitt Romney for Senate or whatever, they have their own political apparatus that they fund. The Court's also saying that individuals can't be capped on spending their own money on campaigns, and so that's Mike Bloomberg buying himself a spot on the Democratic primary stage.</p>
                        <p>05:48 Peter: Yeah, this is an opinion that established what is now a long line of First Amendment jurisprudence concerning election spending that is, in a lot of ways, completely incoherent. It's a mixture of empty platitudes about the importance of speech and a bunch of practical rules that severely limit the ability of the average person to speak, but provide the wealthy and powerful with enormous leeway and flexibility. So Rhi, give us some background here.</p>
                        <p>06:15 Rhiannon: Sure. Actually, before I give you all the background and the history, I just wanted to say that this case, Buckley, is really, really complicated. It's super complicated. It's by some measures, I guess, like the longest opinion in the Supreme Court history.</p>
                        <p>06:34 Peter: Yeah, it's a real problem for a podcast whose hosts read the opinions. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>06:38 Rhiannon: That's right. But I just want to put out there, this subject area, campaign finance and the First Amendment and freedom of speech stuff, it's just difficult for me to understand, and I think I hate the subject area so much because it feels really abstract to me and unfamiliar, and because it's unfamiliar, I don't like engaging with it. But I just want to say that I know that what we're about to talk about is how this case makes it so that the wealthy are essentially given more speech and more political participation than the rest of us, and that's a major reason why the law writ large doesn't work to serve my people, my community, all of us.</p>
                        <p>07:18 Rhiannon: So in particular, because this case and Citizens United feel always to me like a discussion that's really outside of my grasp... You know, I didn't take First Amendment either. But things like money is speech, and corporations have speech rights, that always feels like something like only rich people talk about, so maybe particularly because of that, I think I'll probably have questions during this discussion, but I do want to say that I'm happy to be having a conversation that hopefully makes this terrible formal bullshit accessible for more people, because I think that's the point. The law and the political process are not for elites only. We should all know.</p>
                        <p>07:56 Michael: Right, and I just want to say money is speech is a concept that just is precisely the way law school breaks lawyer brains or something. That like any idiot or any intelligent person on the street would tell you sounds stupid, counter-intuitive and can't possibly be squared with basic understandings of speech, but that's like your pose in class, unless you have a great professor, you're gonna be made to feel a fool. Right?</p>
                        <p>08:27 Rhiannon: Right. It feels ridiculous. It feels absurd to the point of being incomprehensible, really. So, yeah. Okay, so background. Let's set the scene. Take a journey with me. The year is 1974. Top songs on the charts are bangers like Jungle Boogie by Kool & the Gang...</p>
                        <p>08:47 Michael: Hell, yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:48 Rhiannon: Come and get your Love by Redbone and Barbara Streisand's The Way We Were, which I listened to on YouTube today. I don't think it's that good. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:58 Michael: Jungle Boogie, however, is fucking great.</p>
                        <p>09:00 Rhiannon: Yeah, no, Jungle Boogie, absolute gem, totally. The cost of a new home in 1974 is $38,000. A gallon of milk is gonna cost you a buck 50. The President of the United States was a man named Gerald Ford. And if you're having trouble picturing Gerald Ford, just summon the image of a thumb with the teeth of a horse. That's Gerald Ford.</p>
                        <p>09:26 Michael: Excellent.</p>
                        <p>09:27 Rhiannon: So in the wake of the disaster that was the Nixon administration and the Watergate scandal, after which, as you guys know, dozens of individuals and corporations pled guilty to illegally contributing to Nixon's re-election campaign, there was a wave of public demand for campaign finance reform. So the Federal Election Campaign Act, is it known as FECA? Do people say FECA?</p>
                        <p>09:53 Michael: I think so.</p>
                        <p>09:53 Rhiannon: The Federal Election Campaign Act or FECA was originally passed and signed into law actually by President Nixon in 1971, but Congress strengthened the provisions of the Act and added some amendments when everyone was like, "Actually, wait, this guy was a total rat fucker. And now we have to change the entire political landscape of the United States." So the resulting FECA of 1974, it basically had five main features. First, it placed limits on campaign contributions, and it also placed limits on campaign spending. It created a system for public financing of presidential campaigns. It set out provisions for disclosure of political contributions, and it also created an enforcement mechanism for the new law. It created the FEC, the Federal Elections... Commission?</p>
                        <p>10:45 Michael: Commission.</p>
                        <p>10:48 Rhiannon: Commission, yeah. Alright. [laughter] Like I said, I do not know this shit. Quick note, the main thrust of the opinion in Buckley and what we're talking about today deals with the limits on contributions and spending, and so I just want to clarify again like what those terms refer to. Campaign contributions refers, of course, to individuals or corporations giving money to a political campaign, whereas campaign spending refers to spending, like a campaign hiring staffers, but there's also independent expenditures, which are when non-campaign staff, like a PAC or an individual spend money in support of a politician or a campaign. For instance, like if they bought a newspaper ad for a politician.</p>
                        <p>11:35 Michael: Right. Right, right. Part of the reason why this is... Like this shit can seem so dense and opaque is that there's just a lot of jargon around it, what's a contribution versus an in-kind contribution? It's very technical. What's the contribution in an independent expenditure, blah, blah, blah.</p>
                        <p>11:55 Peter: Yeah. All this is is about where people can put their money.</p>
                        <p>11:57 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>11:58 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>12:00 Peter: And if you're occasionally lost listening to this sort of jargon, don't worry about it, it's overly complicated in my mind.</p>
                        <p>12:04 Rhiannon: Yeah, and that's what I was kinda saying up top, formalizing this language and making it super technical is part of what makes people unable to engage with this process the way that rich people do.</p>
                        <p>12:16 Michael: Right. I was a campaign finance lawyer for a little startup PAC for just under a year, and while we were prepping this episode, I was having trouble figuring out what would be a good example of an individual expenditure that wouldn't be like an in-kind contribution or whatever, blah, blah, blah. It's tough. And it's purposely opaque.</p>
                        <p>12:37 Rhiannon: Yeah. So the 1974 amendments to FECA were challenged immediately, and in fact, the very next day after the law goes into effect, the plaintiffs file this lawsuit. Now, who are the plaintiffs? Well, it's kind of a bit of a random group of people you would not think would sort of be unified around the same cause.</p>
                        <p>12:58 Peter: A potpourri.</p>
                        <p>13:01 Rhiannon: A potpourri. Thank you, yes. The plaintiffs include Senator James Buckley from New York. He is a member of the Conservative Party at the time...</p>
                        <p>13:09 Peter: Sounds racist.</p>
                        <p>13:11 Rhiannon: Party candidate. That's right.</p>
                        <p>13:12 Peter: Quick note here about James L. Buckley, that I think we have to mention. He is the brother of William F. Buckley, the conservative luminary, founder of National Review, National Review, obviously a very conservative magazine, founded in, I think it was 1955 or so, because he was mad about segregation ending from what I could tell, and he was like, I got to have a magazine, so that's this guy's brother.</p>
                        <p>13:42 Rhiannon: That's right. Also, Eugene McCarthy, not to be confused with Joseph McCarthy. Eugene McCarthy had run for President on an anti-Vietnam war platform.</p>
                        <p>13:51 Peter: Things didn't go great, though.</p>
                        <p>13:53 Rhiannon: That's right. Also joining the plaintiffs, the ACLU, the Socialist Workers Party, and the American Conservative Union, among others. You love a little rag tag group of boys in their bell bottoms in 1975 marching down to the Federal District Court in DC to file their lawsuit. So their argument here is that limits on campaign spending and contributions violate the First Amendment because, and I'm quoting heavily from their briefs, because limiting the use of money for political purposes amounts to restricting the communication itself, and because the limits allegedly discriminated against challengers in favor of incumbents who are running for office. The plaintiffs also argued that private campaign financing does not foster inequality of political expression, because large contributions are made on behalf of the whole spectrum of political persuasion, and that the limits would make American politics more unresponsive and inevitably lead to an increase in alienation and apathy. Michael, do you have something to say about this, maybe?</p>
                        <p>15:04 Michael: It doesn't sound right to me.</p>
                        <p>15:07 Peter: I gotta say it would be harder for me to find a case where the ACLU and Socialist Workers Party were both on one side and this wrong. But goddamn, were they.</p>
                        <p>15:20 Michael: Yeah. Some of the third-party plaintiffs offered one of my favorite arguments I've ever read, which is that, look, large donations to them actually wouldn't raise the possibility of corruption because they never win, and so they'll never be in position to provide favors to their donors. I'm the biggest fucking loser in the world, arguably.</p>
                        <p>15:41 Rhiannon: Socialists, can we please stop embarrassing ourselves like this?</p>
                        <p>15:42 Michael: Can you imagine that? May it please the court. My dick is tiny. Girls won't talk to me. At least let me take big dollar donations, which I'm sure are gonna be rolling in, Peter, because I got nothing else going for me.</p>
                        <p>16:01 Peter: Your Honor, I'm far too stupid to leverage this money into political power.</p>
                        <p>16:09 Rhiannon: That's right. So yeah, in short, what the plaintiffs are saying is that the reforms imposed by FECA would make it harder for challengers to beat incumbents who are running for office, and it would make it harder for third parties and independents to challenge the hegemony of the US two-party system. So they want outsiders and the little guy and the underdog to have a fair shot, and they thought that limitations on spending and contributions unfairly favor incumbents in the big political parties. So I have a question here, which is, why the fuck do they think this? I truly do not understand the argument. At the time, but it seems like a ton of people think this.</p>
                        <p>16:50 Peter: Yeah, I think, and this is completely amateur historian stuff, it always felt to me like this was just from a different time where the sort of influence of large money on politics wasn't understood to the extent it is today. And a lot of outsiders to the political system viewed fundraising as their sort of way in. So caps on their ability to raise and spend money were reviewed as inhibiting them and entrenching the existing two-party system. In reality, that two-party system ended up being able to successfully intertwine itself with American business and industry in such a way that it had a never-ending spring of money that frankly for any parity outside of those two parties to exist would need to be interrupted.</p>
                        <p>17:41 Rhiannon: Right. Alright, so let's take a second to get to an ad.</p>
                        <p>17:48 Peter: So I want to note here that as Rhiannon mentioned, this is a complicated opinion, it is a long opinion, it's so complicated that a lot of sources, if you research it, use charts to explain the holdings of this case. And so we're gonna kind of hone in on a few particularly egregious aspects of it. The opinion starts by essentially rejecting the idea that money and speech are different for First Amendment purposes. In short, the government had argued that regulating financial expenditures was not the same thing as regulating speech, it's just regulating someone's conduct, and it implicates speech. And the Court says, no, spending and political speech are so closely intertwined that they should be treated as if they are the same thing. That's the heart of the argument made by the so-called free speech crowd on this issue, that limiting spending on a communication amounts to restricting the communication itself.</p>
                        <p>18:47 Peter: So the fundamental problem with blurring this distinction between spending on speech and speech itself is that restrictions on political spending don't limit your ability to speak per se, they limit your ability to reach an audience. They're not controlling the content of the speech, they're just creating a logistical impediment. And to really understand this, you need to understand how the First Amendment has been interpreted. Freedom of speech is not, and has never meant that the government cannot put any restrictions whatsoever on speech. Instead, courts have interpreted it as dependent upon the nature and context of the speech involved, so all sorts of limitations are allowed.</p>
                        <p>19:30 Peter: There are limitations on the use of obscenity or speech inciting violence, limitations on speech in schools and prisons and in advertising, all of that has been upheld. So it's a little strange here that the Court sort of draws a line in the sand and says that unfettered campaign spending or unfettered spending by rich individuals is a line that it cannot cross, and it puts the right to free speech in a very weird place. The most succinct way I can put it is, are you and Jeff Bezos both protected by the First Amendment?</p>
                        <p>20:07 Rhiannon: I guess so, yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:08 Peter: Right, but what does that actually mean? If political expenditures are protected speech, do you really enjoy the same freedom of speech as Jeff Bezos? Of course, you don't. Your experience of that right is so distinct from his, that to describe it as the same right would make the word lose all of its meaning. Anatole France famously said about the law... Yeah, we're doing a couple of episodes straight of us showing off French pronunciation. That was my best effort. Famously said that: "The law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets and to steal loaves of bread." This is the same idea, sort of inverted.</p>
                        <p>20:51 Peter: The law protects both your and Jeff Bezos' right to buy an election. Whatever underlies Jeff Bezos' right to spend the money on politics, it's a right that you and I don't have, in the sense that you cannot do it and you cannot possibly dream of doing it. So the Court is by equating money and speech cementing into place a right that is only actually experienced by an extremely small percentage of people who happen to already be powerful and already have undue influence on the political process.</p>
                        <p>21:23 Michael: Right, right. I know we already sort of said like people didn't understand it as well in the 1970s, but Anatole got this shit in the 1870s, right. Like very frustrating. And especially for third-party candidates, this is an unreal self-own. This is like a fucking historic level of shooting yourself in the dick, 'cause as it turns out, money tends to flow, surprisingly, to people already in power, like incumbents, or to people in position to actually exercise power, like the major parties. So in fact, even with contribution limits, it's incumbents and the major parties who benefit the most from big fundraising.</p>
                        <p>22:12 Michael: It's not hard to figure out that between big money donors, bundlers, who gather together a bunch of big money donors, and corporate spending on independent expenditure committees that it's basically... Or at least up until a few years ago, harder than ever for third parties to compete. The only thing that's really leveled the playing field was like Howard Dean and Obama and then Bernie sort of blazing the trail with online small donors. And with that, it's like a massive uphill battle, you have to have real charisma and a real audience.</p>
                        <p>22:47 Michael: So yeah, and there are other results. It's not just the elections themselves, like politicians now they spend several hours a day fundraising, which means that they spend more time attending to and talking to their donors than they do their constituents. House members, it's like immediately after their term starts they're into their re-election since it's only a two-year term, and so third-party interests are just like their god, who gives a shit, like if you're not giving me money and you're not voting in a primary, like I do not fucking care, at all.</p>
                        <p>23:19 Rhiannon: Yeah, and data collected over the course of the decade since Buckley, it bears all this out. The idea that big money spending doesn't have a profound effect on policy and politics, that's just not true, and of course, it's been completely disproven that large donors are spread evenly across the political spectrum. We know that the wealthy minority in the United States have politics and policy preferences that are profoundly different from the average person, and we know that lawmakers also will rush to do their bidding rather than being beholden to the general public.</p>
                        <p>23:55 Peter: Right. The Court speaks about this as if the speech rights of the wealthy to spend money on political messaging are the only rights being implicated here. But limitations on their right to spend freely are also protecting your freedom of speech by ensuring that your voice is not drowned out by the wealthy and powerful. So when you interpret the law without taking into account these pre-existing power structures and disparities, what happens is you end up effectively codifying those power structures into law and insulating them from attack.</p>
                        <p>24:30 Michael: Right. And this isn't just like a quirky, weird bit of logic that the conservatives or the Court engaged in here, it's like endemic. The conservative project, as it currently exists, is about protecting existing power structures, and if anything, making sure power flows up from the powerless to the powerful even more, and that's reflected in conservative jurisprudence as much as it is in their policy and their politics. And this sort of dull reasoning that's completely divorced from reality, it's characteristic of a lot of the worst decisions in Supreme Court history, from striking down minimum wage and child labor laws in the 1920s, premised on the idea that a kid is in equal bargaining position as like his employer or her employer, as it is today, like you see these sorts of blinkered decisions and these stupid arguments as well, and it's like...</p>
                        <p>25:28 Michael: It's the same idea that animates like All Lives Matter. Nobody who says Black Lives Matter disputes that. The whole point is that our society does not actually treat all lives equally, but that's basically what this is. It's like the free speech version of All Lives Matter.</p>
                        <p>25:44 Peter: Right, right. Yeah, I think the bottom line on this point for me is a real and meaningful reading of the First Amendment needs to account for the fact that part of the purpose of the freedom of speech, according to both the Founders and our courts, is to promote the diversity of ideas. And in that sense, it's not just that allowing uncapped political spending is simply unnecessary to protect free speech, it's that it's actively detrimental. It results in rich people's voices being amplified, while everyone else is denied an equal platform.</p>
                        <p>26:18 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly, and that's really what legal formalism gets you, rules that are divorced and completely separated from the purpose that they're serving. And we've said it before, conservatives often weaponize that separateness to claim that the consequences of a legal rule just aren't relevant, and that what really matters is the maintenance of an internally consistent framework. But the consequences of the legal framework that they use, which they claim is neutral, just happen to align beautifully with the conservative political project.</p>
                        <p>26:55 Michael: And just as an example of what we talk about all the time about how this is bullshit, First Amendment jurisprudence is sort of this tapestry of ad hoc tests in different sorts of situations, and one is, what they call time, place and manner restrictions. And the idea with that is like, look, you can't walk into a quiet residential neighborhood at 3:00 AM and get on a bull horn and start yelling. You can restrict that even though you're restricting speech because the time, the place, and the manner are what's at issue here, not what you're saying. It doesn't matter whether it's liberal or conservative or socialist, the point is that you're disrupting the peace in a way and blah, blah, blah. And so, that gets a very low standard of scrutiny.</p>
                        <p>27:36 Michael: And you can easily apply that framework here. You can say it doesn't matter what your political point of view is. The manner and the time of speech, the time, during an election cycle, and the manner of speech, spending on political advertising, are what's implicated. And it gets a low level of scrutiny. It's something that the Court is not as concerned with. It's a fine framework to handle this with.</p>
                        <p>27:58 Peter: Yeah, absolutely. The Court doesn't have to analyze it as this binary thing where you either allow for these heavy restrictions on speech or you allow it to be completely untouched. You're allowed to step in and use common sense rules. And they just don't. And I think what really gives the lie to the Court's reasoning here is how differently it treats different types of political spending in the decision. So, the Court says that you can cap campaign contributions because those can lead to corruption, but you can't cap independent expenditures of money that are designed to help a candidate, but that don't actually go directly to a campaign.</p>
                        <p>28:38 Peter: So, if you try to donate to Joe Biden, you can only donate X amount and they say, "Yeah, that's fine." But if you decide to independently run some ads for Joe Biden, you can spend as much as you want. This is their creation of the loophole that was eventually blown wide open in Citizens United, and we talked about it a bit there, but it's important to understand how fundamentally ridiculous it is, 'cause the Court is saying that a rich person could buy undue influence with politicians if they were able to donate unlimited amounts to a candidate directly, but if they just run their own campaign ads for that candidate, that's not going to lead to them buying undue influence. There's just no real sugar-coating this.</p>
                        <p>29:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, it just doesn't makes sense.</p>
                        <p>29:23 Peter: It's just incoherent. It's a rule that ignores what corruption actually looks like.</p>
                        <p>29:26 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:27 Peter: You just can't say that campaign contribution limits are necessary for preventing corruption, but then insist that there can be no caps on independent spending, which provides a simple path to the same exact outcome. So, a lot of this might raise the question of why unlimited independent expenditures favor rich people. Independent expenditures are someone spending separately from a campaign. So, maybe I support Joe Biden and I put out an ad, through a PAC probably, that just says, "Joe Biden, cool guy. Donald Trump, not cool, thank you." That's my ad and I spend $50 million on it.</p>
                        <p>30:07 Michael: And it is better than about half the ads Democrats tend to run.</p>
                        <p>30:13 Peter: Right. There's an implied question here, which is why does this benefit rich people? And the answer is pretty simple. Rich people have access to the resources that they need to put together an effective political messaging system. Whereas your average person, yes, you could technically band together with thousands and thousands of people, try to piece together a few corporate entities that you could use to create a PAC and get out a singular message, yeah, you could do that. But you obviously actually can't. And I think that's the bottom line there. You need an enormous amount of collaboration with other people, and the amendments to FECA, in 1974, recognized that, and that's why they capped independent expenditures, because it is something that rich people can take advantage of much more readily than you or I.</p>
                        <p>31:06 Michael: Right. And there are independent expenditure committees that, honestly, you may have donated to. They're like liberal activist groups like Priorities USA that fundraises pretty well among Democratic activists, but also EMILY's List and Planned Parenthood. They have independent expenditure campaigns and you may have kicked them a few dollars. It's not like the left doesn't take advantage of them, but somebody who gets help from Planned Parenthood, just because you've kicked in $5 to their independent expenditure campaign, isn't gonna be calling you up to take your temperature on an upcoming vote. Fucking Kirsten Gillibrand isn't gonna do that. Whereas, if you are a millionaire or a billionaire bank rolling one of these things, then yeah, you just might be getting those phone calls.</p>
                        <p>31:56 Peter: Right. I mean, to put this in perspective, I think the final tally on Michael Bloomberg's campaign spending, I'm not sure that I recall exactly what it was, but it was in excess of $500 million. That would be one of the most successful Democratic-oriented PACs in history, were it to be a single PAC rather than Michael Bloomberg campaign. The ability of people like him to snap their fingers and make enormous volumes of money appear to impact the political process is just unparalleled. There is no amount of collaboration across the working class that can realistically match it.</p>
                        <p>32:36 Peter: So it's important to understand that this arbitrary and superficial distinction between contributions given directly to a campaign and independent spending in support of a campaign is the foundation upon which modern campaign finance law is built. We're nearing half a century later, and the fundamental absurdity of this distinction is still what underpins the majority of campaign finance law. It doesn't take a genius to realize that the function of this ruling is that the most accessible method for the average person to help a campaign, by giving the campaign some money, is restricted, while the Court gives the green light to unfettered spending in areas that are, in practice, exclusively available to the rich.</p>
                        <p>33:23 Michael: Right. So, one thing we haven't really talked about, and it's kind of so big that it swallows this stuff, but also ancillary with independent expenditures, the law had originally created like spending caps for campaigns. So, the idea would be like, it doesn't matter how many people are willing to donate to you, and whether or not you could raise $50 million. You can only spend $10 million on a presidential primary. You could only spend $20 million on a presidential election, and there were other limits for the Senate based on population in the state and things like that. And again, with independent expenditures being unlimited, it almost doesn't matter whether or not those campaign limits would exist, but it is kind of amazing to imagine a world where independent expenditures are capped and campaign spending is capped, and it's so different from ours, but where the campaigns effectively always have spending parity.</p>
                        <p>34:20 Michael: They can only fundraise to a point and then it doesn't matter anymore. Then all they can care about is talking to voters and winning voter approval. Candidates in office fundraise until they have enough for their next primary and general election, and then they can focus on legislating and paying attention at their fucking committee meetings and all that. It's so phenomenally different from the world we live in. It's hard to wrap your head around.</p>
                        <p>34:46 Peter: Right. It really is imagining a world where a politician has no particular use for a rich person. It would completely flip on its head how politics operates right now. It's also because that is so far in the rear view mirror, that rule, it's not particularly relevant to today. At the same time, had it gone the other way, you can envision just a completely different political atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>35:11 Michael: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>35:12 Peter: So an important part of this decision is that it ruled that any caps on a candidate's ability to spend on their own campaign, to invest in their own campaign, were unconstitutional, paving the way for the modern presidential candidate, which is just some rich asshole. All you need to do to be a candidate in this country is to have a lot of money, and bang, your infrastructure is there, which is why our fucking president is just some guy who was rich, right? He could build on that wealth, and just kind of turn it into a political campaign. On the other side, you have these absolute losers, Bloomberg, Howard Schultz, Steyer.</p>
                        <p>35:52 Michael: Schultz. I forgot about Schultz.</p>
                        <p>35:52 Peter: These fucking losers who are just like, "Well, I'm sitting on a whole bunch of money." You can turn that into a relatively viable presidential campaign in no time because of this fucking decision.</p>
                        <p>36:05 Michael: Right, and it's not nothing, like Bloomberg sort of crapped out, and there's a sort of a savvy DC insider take that Elizabeth Warren crushed him in a debate, and it turns out he's not a very good candidate when he's on stage with a bunch of professionals, but he actually, in the states where he and Warren were both on the ballot, he beat her in a lot of them and did very well. And that's just 'cause he could spend a lot of money on like good, sophisticated advertising. And a lot of people didn't know that he wasn't a Democrat, and a lot of people thought that Obama had endorsed him, because of the way he cut these ads. I was in fucking Mexico on vacation and I was seeing Bloomberg ads. It was ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>36:46 Peter: Yeah. I think that a lot of those candidates, like Schultz, Bloomberg get dismissed because they lost, right, because their campaigns eventually lost steam. But you have to put in perspective what they were starting with, which was very little in every case. No infrastructure, no coherent clear message. They took that and turned it into center stage Democratic primary campaigns. They didn't have to do what Bernie did and build years worth of infrastructure. They skipped over the step that Liz Warren sort of failed to complete, which is getting that initial investment and turning it into infrastructure. They skipped over that entirely. I mean, that's why these losers with absolutely nothing interesting to say about the current state of American politics are nonetheless driving its debate.</p>
                        <p>37:38 Rhiannon: Yeah. So, my takeaway from Buckley, right, cutting through all the bullshit, what it comes down to, for me, is that it caps what I, Rhiannon, as an individual, could give to a campaign. But on the other hand, it doesn't cap what, say, Michael Bloomberg can give to his own campaign or what a stupid bitch like Sheldon Adelson can spend on whatever politician he wants.</p>
                        <p>38:04 Peter: Right. And the differential treatment across classes under the First Amendment isn't limited to this case. The Court's interpretation of the First Amendment varies wildly and inexplicably depending on context. We have noted in the past that the Court has severely limited speech rights in schools, basically saying that the government has an interest in maintaining order in schools that outweighs the value of student speech, to the point where First Amendment protections for speech barely apply in public schools, frankly.</p>
                        <p>38:33 Peter: Contrast that approach with this one, where the government's interest in containing political corruption that would undermine our entire political system is treated as if it's sort of irrelevant, as if it's just sort of a sideshow and drastically less important than the right of someone to spend money on politics. That's the game played by the Court in these cases. Sometimes they'll treat First Amendment rights as though they're sacrosanct and untouchable, but when it's convenient, they'll disregard them as trivial.</p>
                        <p>39:02 Peter: And I want to give an example that includes both freedom of speech and another First Amendment right, the right to peacefully assemble. I imagine many of our listeners have participated in protests in recent weeks and months, and you may have noticed that despite speech and assembly both being protected rights under the First Amendment, protesters cannot speak or assemble very freely at all, right? Among other things police can tell you where you can protest, they can often require you to have a permit to protest, they can infiltrate protests with undercover cops, and of course, they can and do violently disperse protests when they deem it acceptable.</p>
                        <p>39:42 Peter: These practices are often upheld by courts as being necessary, similar to speech in schools, because the government has an interest in maintaining order and preventing violence or whatever they claim they're fucking doing, right? And then you contrast it with this, and it's sort of jolting how rigid and inflexible the Court suddenly becomes when the speech interests are not of protesters or your average person, but instead of rich donors. Your ability to influence politics is limited in every regard, your ability to donate, to organize, to protest, all subject to a variety of limitations upheld by the Supreme Court. But the rights of the rich and powerful are not up for negotiation, the freedoms that belong exclusively to rich people are where the Court suddenly refuses to compromise.</p>
                        <p>40:30 Peter: When you hear people on the left say that the law is designed to reinforce existing power structures, this is what they're talking about, this is what we are talking about. To the Court, the right of power to defend itself is untouchable, while the rights of masses of people to exert pressure against that same power are trivial and can be easily cast aside.</p>
                        <p>40:52 Michael: That's right.</p>

                        <p>41:16 Rhiannon: Sounds shitty.</p>

On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about labor rights in a case called Janus v. AFSCME, and they brought in a guest, University of Michigan law professor, Sam Bagenstos. Together, they discuss how the Janus case kneecapped public sector unions by limiting their ability to collect dues.</p>
                        <p>00:33 [Archival]: The Supreme Court has just handed down a decision involving unions.</p>
                        <p>00:39 [Archival]: And they've ruled 5-4 that states can't force non-union workers to pay union fees.</p>
                        <p>00:43 [Archival]: But AFSCME says Janus benefits from the union's bargaining even if he's not a member, and unions are already prohibited from using non-member money for political reasons.</p>
                        <p>00:53 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:03 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have clogged up the American spirit, like cholesterol in our collective aorta. I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy. I'm here with Michael...</p>
                        <p>01:16 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Peter: Rhiannon...</p>
                        <p>01:18 Rhiannon: Hi, how's it going?</p>
                        <p>01:21 Peter: And our second guest, Professor Sam Bagenstos. Sam.</p>
                        <p>01:24 Sam: Hey, how are you?</p>
                        <p>01:24 Peter: Doing great. How are you? Thanks for coming on.</p>
                        <p>01:27 Sam: Great, thanks for having me.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Rhiannon: We're so glad you're here.</p>
                        <p>01:29 Michael: Very excited.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Peter: Sam is a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and a civil rights and employment attorney. We are in the process of becoming a very prestigious and respected academic podcast, and your presence has brought us one step closer.</p>
                        <p>01:48 Sam: This is one step farther way, unfortunately. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:54 Peter: Today, we are discussing Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31, better known as just Janus, a case where the Court took a big swing at public unions. This is probably our most requested case.</p>
                        <p>02:11 Rhiannon: Yeah, so you can stop hitting us up on Twitter...</p>
                        <p>02:13 Peter: Yeah, maybe you guys shut the fuck up. And relax.</p>
                        <p>02:17 Rhiannon: We're doing it. Leave us alone.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:18 Peter: And to understand this case, it's important we give a little bit of background about how unions work, about how public sector unions in particular work and about how for decades, conservatives have worked to advance a legal theory intended and designed to kneecap unions. Janus is a case where the Court held that people have a First Amendment right not to pay union fees because, according to the Court, mandatory union fees violate a person's right to free speech. This case is about agency fees, and we should explain them, they're pretty simple. Public sector unions, and when I say public sector, I mean like teachers' unions, won't be referring to or thinking about police unions for the duration of this podcast in solidarity.</p>
                        <p>03:04 Rhiannon: Yeah, fuck them.</p>
                        <p>03:06 Peter: So those unions charge their members with union dues. If you aren't a member, though, you still have to pay what are called agency fees, and that's because even if you're not a member of a union, you benefit from all the collective bargaining that the union does. So without these fees, people would just opt out of the union to avoid paying dues, but still benefit from the union's work. What economics nerds call a free-rider problem.</p>
                        <p>03:29 Michael: The one and only useful concept in economics.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:35 Peter: So conservatives have long made the argument that making non-members pay these fees is a violation of the First Amendment, because forcing people to pay these fees is compelling them to make political speech. In 1977, they took that argument to the Supreme Court and they lost. The Court said, look, the union can't use non-members' money for political activities, but they can collect money and use it for collective bargaining and other union services. So that case, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, has long been a thorn in conservatives' sides. Over the course of the past decade, there was a real political push on this issue by the right. Several states passed new right-to-work laws which prohibit union fees for non-members. The Supreme Court's conservatives, especially Justice Alito, started claiming in opinions fairly explicitly that they thought the Abood decision was incorrect and should be revisited, and in 2018 when this case comes down, they get their chance. So Rhi, tell us about this Janus guy.</p>
                        <p>04:36 Rhiannon: Yeah, the story of Janus starts in Illinois. So back in 2015, Illinois elected Republican Bruce Rauner as their governor, and that year... This is a side note about who this guy is, that year Rauner reported making more than $180 million. He is the chairman of a private equity firm, and he ran for governor explicitly on a platform that was anti-union.</p>
                        <p>05:01 Peter: Before we continue, I think a round of applause for this guy for achieving success in both the private and public sectors.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:07 Rhiannon: He worked so hard. He worked so hard.</p>
                        <p>05:11 Michael: I'm re-thinking my views about unions and private equity right now.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:16 Rhiannon: So when this fucking douchebag took office, he issued an executive order pretty immediately, and the executive order stopped collection of agency fees from non-union members who benefited from a contract that was negotiated by the AFS...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:35 Michael: Don't people just call it AFSCME?</p>
                        <p>05:37 Rhiannon: They do? Okay, like Peter said, that's the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. It's a very large union, which at the time represented Illinois public sector employees. So the Governor in Illinois issues this executive order banning AFSCME from collecting fees from non-members, and he also goes ahead and preemptively files a lawsuit in federal court against AFSCME to challenge these agency shop agreements as unconstitutional on the basis that they violate the First Amendment. Now, there were some initial issues with the lawsuit because AFSCME argued correctly that Governor Rauner didn't have standing. He's not personally injured, he's not a non-member of a union paying agency fees. So some different plaintiffs get subbed in, and the lawsuit continues without the Governor as a party. And one of those plaintiffs is Mark Janus. He is a child support expert who worked for the state of Illinois, and that's how he opposed having to pay these agency fees, and that's how he becomes a party to the case.</p>
                        <p>06:45 Michael: Child Support Expert has big men's rights activist divorced dad energy.</p>
                        <p>06:52 Peter: Yeah. You could say I'm a child support expert.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:55 Peter: I have no idea if that's accurate, but it just feels right to me.</p>
                        <p>07:00 Rhiannon: Yes, while the case proceeded through the federal court system, there were actually other similar cases happening around the country. A similar complaint regarding agency fees was making its way to the Supreme Court from California. And in July 2015, the Janus case was put on hold, because the California case, which was called Friedrichs, was granted cert, so it was going to the Supreme Court. But before the Supreme Court could issue its decision in Friedrichs... Justice Scalia died, bitch!</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:34 Rhiannon: So, without Scalia that case was decided 4-4, and that left in place the lower court's decision, which happened to affirm Abood, which Peter talked about up top. Now, without a Supreme Court decision, and now with Gorsuch replacing Justice Scalia, the Janus case out of Illinois restarted. But like the Ninth Circuit had done in Friedrichs, the Seventh Circuit here dismissed Janus's case on the basis of Abood, and Janus appealed to the Supremes. Now, just a little bit of background about how this case made its way through the courts and the similar cases that are happening throughout the country at the same time. Like we've talked about in many of our episodes, these cases are often the result of directed political action by conservatives over the course of years, what comes along with them is a lot of big money organizing around these causes. For instance, one of these organizations, it's called the State Policy Network.</p>
                        <p>08:38 Peter: Ah, yes.</p>
                        <p>08:38 Rhiannon: It's another organization with a...</p>
                        <p>08:41 Peter: SPN.</p>
                        <p>08:42 Rhiannon: These buzz words in the name, yeah. The State Policy Network is a consortium of conservative and libertarian think tanks, and it advances policies for business lobbyists and GOP donors, especially on the state level. These guys, the SPN, were in strong support of Janus and this kind of anti-union advocacy across the country, and even though they don't disclose their donors, a Texas affiliate organization of the State Policy Network inadvertently revealed its donor list a few years back, and what do you know, it included grants from such illustrious parties as the Koch Industries, AT&T, GEO group, Exxon Mobile and Coca-Cola. Also officially, they call their donors investors, so... That's, yeah...</p>
                        <p>09:30 Michael: I think that's more accurate. I appreciate that.</p>
                        <p>09:33 Peter: I respect that.</p>
                        <p>09:34 Rhiannon: At least they're upfront about it, right?</p>
                        <p>09:35 Peter: My mom, I consider her an investor in me...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:41 Rhiannon: That's right. Okay, and while people in these think tanks and advocacy organizations like the State Policy Network, while they're saying that all of this anti-union stuff is really about the individual constitutional and free speech rights of workers, and they also tell their affiliate organizations to frame it in those ways too, their broad political motive is weakening unions. Internal documents reveal that they were excited about the Janus decision, saying it could potentially lead to the removal of over $1 billion, per election cycle, from union budgets. The president of the SPN affiliate in Michigan, he wrote, "Imagine the change we will see in policy debates over public education, taxes, social welfare spending and other issues, if the fear of union backlash is cut by two-thirds." So they're chomping at the bit. They love this, right?</p>
                        <p>10:36 Rhiannon: And immediately following the Janus decision, the SPN launched a massive campaign to push state affiliates and organizations to reach more than five million teachers, librarians and other public sector employees, and they wanted to encourage those public sector workers to opt out of union membership and dues payment. And when you get these assholes talking, they will eventually reveal that they don't care at all about free speech, or the Constitution, or whatever, but actually they care about elections.</p>
                        <p>11:04 Rhiannon: For instance, after Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin, the president of the SPN affiliate in Wisconsin said, "There's no doubt that with the decline of union membership here, the political clout of the union bosses and their ability to automatically turn out members for Democrats has declined dramatically." And for what it's worth, just by the way, Mark Janus, we should say, is a former child support expert, because he now has a full-time job with the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative think tank that funded this case.</p>
                        <p>11:38 Sam: His binder's thick.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:40 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>11:43 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>11:45 Michael: Okay, that seems like a good time to maybe take a break for an ad.</p>
                        <p>11:50 Peter: So on to the court's opinion, it's another Sam Alito one, and we're sorry about this.</p>
                        <p>11:56 Michael: Breaking my spirit.</p>
                        <p>11:57 Peter: Yeah, we understand the toll this is taking on all of you emotionally, and we apologize.</p>
                        <p>12:01 Rhiannon: Every single week I beg. I say, "I don't want to read." And Peter says, "You have to!" And I don't want to do it.</p>
                        <p>12:10 Peter: Look, we don't pay you half a million a year to not read the papers.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:18 Peter: Alright, so the Court says that you can't make non-union members pay union fees, because it's effectively compelling them to speak under the First Amendment. And I think the first issue that really jumps out to me about that is that I don't think what the union is doing should be considered First Amendment speech at all. Speech is broad, it doesn't have to be actually spoken or written, it can be any form of expression, including through someone who represents you, like a union, but the union is negotiating wages and benefits and other workplace conditions. You might not agree with what their goals are in every case, but they're not expressing an ideological or political position. How can the day-to-day business of running a union be an expression of an opinion?</p>
                        <p>13:07 Peter: It doesn't make sense to me, but the central argument that Alito is making is, "Look, if you are some non-union member being forced to pay these fees toward the union, they're doing all these things that you don't agree with," and he uses these terms, agency fees are forcing "free and independent individuals" to endorse ideas they don't approve of. And Alito tries to hook it into big political issues, he's like, well, look, the stuff the union does impacts the public budget and taxes, and you can't just force someone who disagrees on those issues to go along with it, which is like, first of all, very reachy, everything impacts public budgets and taxes.</p>
                        <p>13:46 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>13:47 Peter: And also, it seems like what's really being said is that you can't be made to pay for an organization whose goals you don't agree with. If you don't like unions, you shouldn't have to pay fees to them. And the thing that keeps popping in my head is, doesn't just make all taxes illegal, right, like he says the government can't force you to subsidize someone else's speech. Okay, but it does that all the time. The government can mandate you to pay taxes and then it uses that money to do whatever it wants, and you don't get to just claim First Amendment protection when they go and bomb a country when you don't agree with it. And more like analogous, when they give the money to subsidize Shell Oil, who then uses it to invent better ways to kill humpback whales, [chuckle] I sure would like to be able to say, I'd rather not pay those taxes.</p>
                        <p>14:31 Sam: If I might interject... What if I'm paying taxes to support Donald Trump calling protesters thugs? Right now I'm being forced to pay for speech I disagree with, but nobody says that's a First Amendment violation.</p>
                        <p>14:44 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>14:45 Peter: If Alito's argument is correct here, then basically all taxes are unconstitutional, so it's not that this argument is bad in the sense that it's poorly reasoned, it's more that it's objectively incorrect, like this is not what the law is, period.</p>
                        <p>15:00 Michael: Right. And the tax example can feel a little extreme, but at the very least, this feels very analogous to licensing requirements and public-private partnerships, like you mentioned, giving it to Shell Oil, but any government contract with Raytheon or Boeing or whatever is very much like taking money from a public fund and giving it to a private organization to do something that we've decided is in the general public interest.</p>
                        <p>15:27 Peter: And some lawyers have tried to take this reasoning a little farther. This term in the Supreme Court, they tried to argue that under this logic, the government can't make you pay these fees if you don't agree with them, that lawyers shouldn't be forced to pay Bar Association fees, and I gotta say, hell, yeah. [chuckle] And only two conservatives bought this argument by the way, Gorsuch and Thomas, although I think that if the other three were being intellectually honest here, or at least Roberts and Alito, who signed on to Janus, then certainly the same logic applies, right, how can the government force you to pay for a Bar fee and not a union? It doesn't really make sense. The only real distinction is that they think that unions are like this horrific political thing that people should be able to fight against if they want to.</p>
                        <p>16:17 Rhiannon: Well, and let's hash it out a little bit. I think people like the State Policy Network will say explicitly, like unions end up being sort of these shills, they turn out tons of votes for Democrats specifically, but I don't know. So what... I don't know, it's an organization of people.</p>
                        <p>16:39 Michael: Right. And they collectively are choosing to endorse and support candidates who represent their interest, it's just the way it is that those interests are best represented by Democratic platforms.</p>
                        <p>16:52 Peter: I think that there's this assumption running through it that anything a union does is inherently political, but anything that Raytheon or Lockheed Martin does, that's just the government doing business. It's just the categorization of some things as political and some things as apolitical without any real coherent way to draw that line.</p>
                        <p>17:13 Michael: And we talk a lot about conservatives on the Court having business-aligned interests, and you can't think about these things, these legal issues, without understanding the degree to which big industry and big money donors support right-wing politicians. And as a result, their agenda reflects the priorities of big corporations, which very often are in opposition to the priorities of their workers, and as a result, like labor writ large doesn't really have a comfortable place in the Republican right-wing coalition. Democratic politicians more than Republicans, I think some people will debate the degree to which Democrats have abandoned labor, but certainly more than Republicans will reflect the concerns of labor, and so there's this sort of symbiotic relationship where unions go to Democrats for protection and for expansion of their rights and the rights of their members, both their rights as institutions and for the benefit of individual workers, and in return, they provide benefits to Democrats in the form of fundraising and advocacy and help in elections.</p>
                        <p>18:34 Sam: Yeah and if might add, it's not just about Democrats versus Republicans, 'cause I do think you're right, that there's the Republican party, which is basically anti-union in very significant ways, and then there's the Democratic party, which is split between different factions.</p>
                        <p>18:50 Michael: Right, at best.</p>
                        <p>18:53 Sam: But... Absolutely, but it's also about the issues outside of the workplace that these labor organizations are pushing, and you saw that with the quote from the State Policy Network that you talked about earlier in the podcast, who are the people who are arguing for public education? Well, the biggest organizations arguing for public education instead of charter schools and taking all of the public money and sending it to private schools, our teachers unions, who are the people who arguing for expanding the social safety net. Well, often it is folks like AFSCME and SCIU and the people on the right, understand that, they wanna keep their taxes down, they don't wanna build up institutions that are public institutions, they want everybody for themselves because they're ideologically committed to it and because it benefits them personally.</p>
                        <p>19:45 Sam: So even outside of the workplace, this stuff matters a lot, and I think that's why it's no surprise that all the same people who are against public employee unions are also against public schools and against raising taxes to improve the safety net and all of those things.</p>
                        <p>20:03 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>20:03 Peter: Right...</p>
                        <p>20:04 Rhiannon: Go our king!</p>
                        <p>20:06 Michael: That's right. Fucking tell them. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:10 Peter: So, to summarize the function of this opinion, the government can compel you to pay taxes and then use that money for literally whatever it wants, but the government can't compel you to pay a union fee that it uses to do union stuff. When the First Amendment is about regulating the government, how can a scenario with more government involvement be somehow more constitutional, if the government is using your taxes to fund its own speech? I don't really understand it, and I don't think that it actually makes any sense, and I think that the biggest clue in this opinion is that Alito takes various pot shots at unions generally, throughout it. He complains about how they're privileged in negotiations, which is sort of one way of putting it, I suppose. At one point in time, many years ago, someone was like, "Hey, if workers are allowed to negotiate as a unit, that's better for them," and here we are centuries later, and conservatives are just like, "This is such bullshit, dude."</p>
                        <p>21:14 Rhiannon: To the extent that they're "privileged" in negotiation at all, it's just because they're a labor organization, because it's a block of people who are speaking together about something, that is the point, that's not an unfair advantage.</p>
                        <p>21:29 Peter: I don't think that it is a real privilege. Management is a corporation. When they negotiate with a union, management is a conglomeration of people that is being represented by a single entity. It's the same thing. What they are concerned about equality between workers and the company.</p>
                        <p>21:40 Michael: That's what I was gonna say, that privilege is that traditionally, a corporation negotiating directly with an individual is in a very powerful, unequal bargaining position, and unions level that playing field. That's the privilege, to not have to acquiesce to everything the big corporation wants and get steam-rolled. Your privilege is that you get to argue on equal footing.</p>
                        <p>22:08 Sam: On a more equal footing. Yep, yeah.</p>
                        <p>22:11 Peter: I think that rich people think that unions are bad for business because they view business as an abstraction, rather than something that people actually participate in it. Someone like Gorsuch, you know how people have those "live, laugh, love" signs in their house, he has one that just says "efficiency," he stares at it for 15 minutes every morning, sipping coffee, and he's like, "Time to go to work."</p>
                        <p>22:33 Rhiannon: That's what he's inspired by. Yeah. And so towards the end of the opinion, there's a sort of sneak attack by Justice Alito, where he says, "Not only can you not require non-members to pay these agency fees, what this means is you can't automatically opt employees into the union, they need to affirmatively opt in," and he says that this kind of new thing is necessary to avoid making people who disagree with the union pay any dues. But is that really necessary?</p>
                        <p>23:06 Peter: Yeah, it seems perhaps there might be an ulterior motive there. We've talked in the past about what's the least restrictive means for doing something, and surely, if the concern is that people might unwillingly pay money to a union they don't agree with, there's a better way to deal with that, than by having all of them be opted out by default. Okay, so Kagan writes the dissent here and she focuses almost exclusively on the fact that this decision overturns precedent, rather than making any particularly poignant arguments about the substance of the decision.</p>
                        <p>23:40 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:42 Sam: And that's a hallmark of Justice Kagan on the Supreme Court, is her dissent. She's over and over and over again, attacking, overturning a precedent, instead of talking about what the case is really about. And some of that is, everybody thinks she's trying to build a case that when they finally overturn Roe v. Wade, she can write a dissent saying, "See here, they're overturning precedent again." It's not clear to me what that's gonna get her, you know, at that point.</p>
                        <p>24:07 Rhiannon: Thanks, Elena.</p>
                        <p>24:12 Sam: But also, I think here, it's a real missed opportunity, because she allows to go by, basically unchallenged, this whole set of free speech arguments that Alito makes in the majority, and when you look at it, I think you guys have been pulling at a lot of these threads, the free speech side of this case is actually the side in favor of the union, in the favor of agency fees. Because what is the union here? It's the way that the workers get voice, and if you have a rule that says that unions can't operate because they have to provide services to people who don't have to pay, so nobody's gonna pay and we're just gonna bleed the union dry and the union's eventually gonna die, what you end up doing is make it impossible for workers to join together, to speak in a way that's effective.</p>
                        <p>25:01 Sam: And the other thing that Alito just completely ignores, is that the union, it's not like somebody went out and picked AFSCME and said, "AFSCME is gonna decide what happens here." The workers voted for AFSCME, they made a choice, they spoke in an election saying, "We want these people to represent us," and of course, Justice Kagan doesn't make any of these points, because she's making a point about precedent. I get why she's doing it, but she misses the opportunity to actually make a much more powerful argument for her side.</p>
                        <p>25:34 Rhiannon: Yeah, we say it a lot on the pod, that the liberals often in dissent, really miss opportunities to substantively attack what conservatives are saying, and it seems like they're trying to play the conservative formalism game and make it about formal procedural issues, instead of really getting to the heart of the constitutional precedent.</p>
                        <p>25:55 Peter: And Kagan is probably the worst of them. Sotomayor, especially on worker rights, is pretty solid, Ginsburg is actually quite strong and often at her most poignant when talking about the history of the labor movement.</p>
                        <p>26:06 Sam: Kagan always wants to be convincing all the conservatives that she's as good at playing their games as they are. That's the hallmark of her Justiceship, and maybe sometimes she can persuade a conservative Justice on something that they wouldn't otherwise be persuaded by. It won't be on an issue that they really care about, something like this, she's never gonna persuade them, and why not just lead with what's actually going on.</p>
                        <p>26:35 Rhiannon: It's so cool to hear a professor say this stuff that we think.</p>
                        <p>26:39 Sam: That's why I love your podcast, 'cause you say the stuff that I think.</p>
                        <p>26:42 Michael: You seem to say it with much better articulation.</p>
                        <p>26:45 Peter: Yeah, that's the difference.</p>
                        <p>26:46 Rhiannon: He didn't even have to say "fuck," one time.</p>
                        <p>26:49 Sam: I've never heard that word.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:53 Peter: So this is all part of a lengthy campaign by the right, both within the courts and in more political spheres to hack away at the ability of unions to finance themselves, and it's been especially targeted at public unions over the past couple of decades, because while private unions have declined, public unions remain quite strong. I noted up top that the interest of the conservatives on the Court in this issue seemed to coincide with the resurgence of political interest in the issue by the Republican Party. Right-to-work laws, which again prohibit agency fees to unions by non-members originally popped up after the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, but for decades, they were the law in just a minority of states. But in the 2010s, Republicans started pushing them across the country. Michigan and Indiana passed right-to-work laws in 2012, Wisconsin in 2015, West Virginia in 2016, Alabama already had a law, but in 2016, they put it in their state constitution. Jesus.</p>
                        <p>27:56 Rhiannon: Really brought it home.</p>
                        <p>27:58 Peter: Yeah, it's right below mandatory lynching ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:03 Peter: And Kentucky passed one in 2017. So conservatives on the Court are sort of mirroring the broader reactionary movement. As the 2010s go on, the Justices begin to openly question the legality of these fees, and eventually it ends with this case where they strike them down. So it shouldn't need to be said that conservatives have a clear ideological objective here. They're looking to undermine unions, and if they need to lean on a completely incoherent view of the First Amendment, they'll do that.</p>
                        <p>28:32 Sam: So you talk about a political campaign that the right has had in legislatures and in elections around the country, but if you look at the road to Janus in the Supreme Court, you see actually the conservative Justices on the Supreme Court, and particularly Justice Alito, doing exactly the same thing. So it begins in a case in 2012 where he says, "Boy, this Abood case, I don't know, it's really extraordinary. We really ought to do something about it." And then there's another case a couple of years later where he narrows Abood even more and says, "Boy, Abood, it's sitting out there, guys. There's no... " And then they had the Friedrichs case, which they thought was gonna be what they would use to take out public employee unions, and then Justice Scalia died, it ended up 4-4.</p>
                        <p>29:23 Sam: And so then here we are in the Janus case. But it's clearly this campaign over case after case after case, where Justice Alito not only clearly wants to strangle unions and public employee unions particularly, but is sending these signals to all the conservative litigators, "Bring these cases. We wanna see more cases."</p>
                        <p>29:45 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:48 Sam: So it's this relationship between Justice Alito and the conservative Justices on the bench, the political actors like the Koch brothers and the lawyers they fund to make sure that they can move the jurisprudence. So if you sit there thinking that what the judges do is they just hear the cases that come to them and they decide by calling balls and strikes, you look here, and that's clearly not what's going on.</p>
                        <p>30:07 Michael: That's exactly right.</p>
                        <p>30:08 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's such a good point, and it's not just that Justice Alito and the conservative Justices only speak through their written opinion. We've talked on the podcast before, they speak all the time, they go to universities and speak publicly, and Alito during... Over the course of years, is saying publicly that Abood is he believes a wrongly decided decision, and they're signaling this to the public in many ways, and signaling that they're not objective thinkers the way they want us to think they are.</p>
                        <p>30:36 Sam: Yeah. They're just fighting along in this political battle with all of their conservative colleagues, they're just doing it from a different place.</p>
                        <p>30:43 Michael: Right, that's right. And this campaign framing it as corporations, wealthy donors not liking workers having bargaining power makes sense, and it's right, but unions have long been an engine for Democratic candidate fundraising and a key part of their turnout efforts, their apparatuses. And so the anti-union push can and should be framed as part of this larger sort of conservative effort to tilt elections in their favor, which is in keeping with our discussion of gutting of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County and campaign finance laws and Citizens United. And Citizens United is especially pernicious, because a big way that the conservatives tried to put a non-partisan gloss on that decision was by noting that it opened up not only corporate spending, but also union spending on elections, but then of course, it's immediately followed by a decade of attacks, legislative and judicial, on kneecapping unions and eliminating their ability to spend in elections.</p>
                        <p>31:49 Peter: Yeah, you give them the right to spend money and then you take away their ability to spend money.</p>
                        <p>31:52 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:53 Michael: Yeah. And it's been successful. It worked. There is a recent study, just a couple of years ago that found right-to-work laws reduced Democratic vote share by 3.5%, which is like an insane number, like Democrats get 3% less of the vote in states that have right-to-work law than they would otherwise. Part of that has to be fundraising, which makes perfect sense, but it's also that unions play a role in how Democrats get out the vote. I've worked in a presidential campaign, primaries and the general election, and have seen it first hand, they play a big part in literally on election day, getting to Democratic voters, getting them to the polls, but even throughout the election, doing a lot of work. Campaigns rely a lot on volunteers. And there are things you can't ask volunteers to do, like when some religious fanatic is flyering churches with pictures of aborted fetuses and shit like that, you can't ask your wide-eyed 22-year-old volunteer to do something about that, but the union will send people out there to wait till they leave and then pull up all those flyers off all the wind shields. The decline in Democratic vote share persisted to a lesser degree, but down ballot to the House, Senate, State and local races as well.</p>
                        <p>33:09 Michael: I mean, in practical terms, this means right-to-work laws in Michigan and Wisconsin won those states for Trump, they won Ron Johnson's seat in the Senate over Russ Feingold. They've almost certainly won gubernatorial elections for Republicans, and in the same study, they found that the same laws reduced Democratic fundraising. So between Citizens United and right-to-work, you have corporate spending exploding while Democratic fundraising, in part to the loss from unions, going down. And so you can see there's a huge thumb on the scale in elections, and this is just... These cases that we've already discussed are just a small part of the tapestry, you'll be hearing from us some more about in gerrymandering and public financing of elections. It's just a massive effort from the right, from the courts, the state houses, the Senate, everywhere.</p>
                        <p>34:02 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>34:04 Sam: I just have one more point that I'd really like to make about this decision because it really sticks in my craw. So, if you read the very beginning of Justice Alito's opinion for the Court, the very first sentence says, "Under Illinois law, public employees are forced to subsidize a union, even if they choose not to join... " Yada yada yada. And throughout the opinion, there's this rhetoric of people are forced. If you're an employee, you're forced to do with these things to support this organization you don't like. And as a labor and employment law professor myself, I was just so struck by how this same set of conservative Justices in a bunch of other cases, talks all the time about how employees just choose to give up their rights to go to court when they supposedly sign arbitration agreements. And I hope you'll talk about those cases on the podcast too. There's a case like Epic systems where the very first line is the Court saying something like, "When workers choose to arbitrate their plans rather than go to court, the question is, do we honor that choice?" Right.</p>
                        <p>35:14 Sam: And here's the thing, Mr. Janus, he could have worked somewhere else. He could have organized people to vote against the union, whereas the people who sign these arbitration agreements, so-called sign them, most of the time they don't even sign them, actually. It's just they're home one day, at night after work, they get an email that says, "If you show up to work tomorrow, you will be treated as having signed this agreement." Because...</p>
                        <p>35:40 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>35:41 Sam: In most workplaces in America your job is at will, which means you can be fired at any time, which means every day the employer doesn't fire you is like them doing you a favor. And so I'm struck by... Of course, and it shows that this is really about a much broader agenda, the political agenda you're talking about. It's not about we wanna honor the choices of workers, 'cause they don't honor the choices of workers consistently. What it's about is they don't like unions and they don't want unions to be funded. This is part of a defund the left scheme, and the conservatives on the Court, like the Koch brothers and the conservatives off the Court, are all a part.</p>
                        <p>36:20 Rhiannon: Yes. Hell, yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:20 Michael: Fucking Amen, dude.</p>
                        <p>36:22 Peter: Right. These positions that they're taking aren't part of a comprehensive philosophy that promotes or protects workers' rights, they're just the cynical and the strategic deployment of rhetoric to get the argument where they want it to go. So workers' rights weren't so important to Alito and Hobby Lobby when he said that a private company could dictate their employees' access to contraceptive healthcare. Sam mentioned Epic Systems, where the Court held that workers could be made to sign away their right to class action lawsuits. They're only defending workers' rights where they can leverage them against people and institutions they don't like. So you'll often see the Court framing it as if they are talking about worker choice or individual choice, and you can't let that fool you. The conservatives on the Court are absolutely not concerned with the free speech of your average worker, not now and they never will be.</p>
                        <p>37:08 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>37:10 Rhiannon: So after the Janus decision, AFSCME went from having 112,000 agency fee-payers to 2000, which was a 98% drop in those non-member fees that they were collecting. And another very large public sector worker union, the Service Employees International Union, went from having 104,000 agency fee-payers to just under 6000.</p>
                        <p>37:34 Peter: But I think there's some good news, at least that it seems like in the year or two since Janus, actual union membership...</p>
                        <p>37:41 Rhiannon: I saw that membership was flush... Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:43 Peter: Union membership still looks strong. I think the big caveat there is that this is a long-term play. The lack of agency fees will slowly eat at the unions, almost certainly. It's just sort of a question of whether they can withstand it and to... Whether and to what extent they can withstand it.</p>
                        <p>37:58 Sam: We really have no idea what the long-term effect is going to be. Obviously, what this does is it makes it much, much harder for labor organizations to operate, to expand and to have the kind of... Have the kind of membership and power that they need, because everybody can now say, "Well, I get all the benefits without paying any of the costs, so why shouldn't I just do that?" I think different unions are different in how they've responded and how their workers have responded. You look at some unions where after right-to-work, they didn't lose that many members at all because they worked really hard to kind of retain their membership.</p>
                        <p>38:43 Sam: But I think when you talk about the long term, the thing to focus on is that means that those unions can't be focusing on organizing new workplaces, 'cause they've gotta be focusing on continuing to build the bonds with their membership. So I think we've got to expect it's gonna at least slowly erode the power of unions in American politics and in the American workplace. And in some unions, it had a really quick effect. There were folks who said, "Well, when Janus was decided, we had to cut our budget by a third that year." So, I think there's an immediate impact, which is pretty clear, there's a longer term impact, which is hard to predict precisely, but we know it does put this big barrier in the way.</p>
                        <p>39:30 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:30 Michael: Right, right. And there is the potential, at least, for sort of a negative feedback loop in the partisan dynamic I was describing, where it's like... Studies say that it hurts Democratic fundraising. And so do you just accept that? Or if you're a politician, do you start looking for money elsewhere? And you might start looking for money in places that are not necessarily as sympathetic to unions, like Silicon Valley or something. And then you start getting cross-pressures within the Democratic coalition on labor, which those cross-pressures already exist. It could make it harder. And then that sort of builds on itself. If they become even less committed to unions, then you're gonna get less union support and vice versa, until they're not even really a force anymore.</p>
                        <p>40:16 Rhiannon: That's a really good point.</p>
                        <p>40:17 Peter: I would like to see teachers' unions and other public unions adopt the model of police unions, which is rather than organizing and exercising solidarity, if a politician, like the mayor, disagrees with you, you publicly threaten their daughter's life. And you see where that gets you. It seems to be working for the police, and I think that as you see teachers get less and less funding within their unions...</p>
                        <p>40:46 Michael: They have a lot of access to kids too, that's a real...</p>
                        <p>40:48 Peter: That's right. We'll just write an open letter to the Governor, like, "We're not gonna let your kid come home today if you... "</p>
                        <p>41:06 Peter: Thanks to our guest, Sam Bagenstos.</p>
                        <p>41:09 Rhiannon: Thank you so much.</p>
                        <p>41:11 Michael: This was a great time. Thank you for coming.</p>
                        <p>41:13 Sam: Yeah it was. Thanks a lot. The pleasure was all mine. This was really a lot of fun, thanks. My career is probably over now, but I appreciate your having me on.</p>
                        <p>41:23 Peter: Don't worry. We're gonna get you the sweet podcast money. You will never turn back.</p>
                        <p>41:28 Sam: Solid. Alright.</p>
                        <p>41:31 Peter: Next week is a Buckley v. Valeo, the case that held that money is speech. Should be a good one. I'm saving up to allow myself to speak on the podcast.</p>

                        <p>00:02 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about qualified immunity, the Supreme Court doctrine that protects police and other state officials from getting sued when they're operating in legal gray areas. As you'll hear, these gray areas have come to include egregious conduct.</p>
                        <p>00:23 [Archival]: The courts have interpreted this qualified immunity to almost give complete impunity to the police offices.</p>
                        <p>00:33 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:48 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have burned through America like a dry season brush fire through a grassland plain.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:00 Peter: I am Peter. Twitter's The_Law_Boy. I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:06 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:07 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:08 Rhiannon: Hello.</p>
                        <p>01:09 Peter: And today we are talking about qualified immunity, the doctrine that insulates police and other government officials from liability when they are sued for violating your constitutional rights. Usually, we do one case at a time, but to understand qualified immunity, you really need to understand how it was created and how it has developed since then. Qualified immunity has gotten a lot of public attention recently given that police appear to be on a nationwide rampage of unfettered violence and a corresponding self-pity campaign that is breathtaking to behold.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:45 Peter: We had originally planned this episode as having a sort of hopeful element because the Supreme Court was considering taking on several qualified immunity cases next year, and both Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas had expressed publicly a willingness to revisit the doctrine, leading some of us to believe that perhaps there was a chance for reform, but last week, the Supreme Court punished us for our naive optimism, denying review to all of the pending qualified immunity cases, in total 13 this year rejected. And, yeah, I mean, we look stupid. What can I say?</p>
                        <p>02:24 Rhiannon: Yep, yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:25 Peter: By the way, at the bottom of the episode, we're also going to talk a bit about DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program initiated by the Obama administration, upheld this week in the Supreme Court. Michael is going to walk you through the details there.</p>
                        <p>02:44 Michael: Fun stuff.</p>
                        <p>02:46 Peter: So there are laws that allow you to sue police officers for violating your civil rights, namely 42 USC 1983, Section 1983, a law passed in 1871 as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, AKA the Ku Klux Klan Act.</p>
                        <p>03:07 Rhiannon: Hell, yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:08 Peter: At the time, Congress was worried about racial violence in the South and it recognized that the problem was not just about rogue actors like the KKK. State officials and police were complicit, and accordingly, citizens needed a mechanism to hold those officials accountable.</p>
                        <p>03:27 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>03:27 Peter: And 100 years later, the Supreme Court was like, "Actually, maybe we should provide some limitations here." And in the late 1960s, the Supreme Court invented a concept called qualified immunity, which shields government officials such as police from being held liable when they are performing their duties. And when we say they invented it, we mean exactly that.</p>
                        <p>03:52 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>03:53 Peter: It's not written or implied in the law anywhere, it was never established by Congress in any tangible way, it was simply created by the Court.</p>
                        <p>04:01 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:02 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>04:03 Michael: Before we continue, can... I just want to step back really quick 'cause it's something I didn't really think about until just this moment, is that apparently in 1871, when they were concerned about white supremacist Ku Klux Klan violence on black people, they were like, "You gotta be able to fucking sue the cops."</p>
                        <p>04:18 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:19 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:19 Michael: And it's nice to know that in 140 years, fucking nothing has changed.</p>
                        <p>04:26 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>04:27 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:27 Peter: Well, something has changed. Back then, Congress was willing to understand that police were part of the problem.</p>
                        <p>04:32 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:32 Rhiannon: Yep, yep.</p>
                        <p>04:33 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>04:34 Peter: And now they're in their pocket. So...</p>
                        <p>04:37 Michael: We have moved backwards since Reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>04:40 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>04:40 Michael: Okay.</p>
                        <p>04:41 Peter: So it's important to know that... So there's this law, this statute, Section 1983, and qualified immunity is not part of that. The Supreme Court invented it in a 1967 case called Pierson v. Ray.</p>
                        <p>04:53 Rhiannon: Yeah. And in our Terry versus Ohio episode, the episode about stop-and-frisk, we told you that like the entire stop-and-frisk doctrine, that started with a racist cop. So, hey, guess what, everybody, qualified immunity also starts with a racist cop.</p>
                        <p>05:12 Michael: Wow.</p>
                        <p>05:12 Rhiannon: What happened was cops in Mississippi were arresting black clergy who were using a segregated bus stop, and a few years later, the law they had violated, the clergy had violated, was found unconstitutional. So the Supreme Court said, look, you can't sue the cops here because they couldn't have known that the law would eventually be found unconstitutional. At the time the cops were enforcing what they thought was a constitutional law.</p>
                        <p>05:39 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:40 Peter: And so the premise is obvious enough, you didn't want police to be held responsible if they're acting in good faith, just because they couldn't predict how a gray area of the law would ultimately be interpreted, and you didn't want... The Court said they didn't want police just avoiding doing their jobs so that they can avoid liability.</p>
                        <p>05:58 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:58 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>06:00 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>06:00 Peter: And the emphasis, in this case, was on the good faith of the officer, like was the officer in good faith trying to enforce the law. And I said that qualified immunity starts with this case, but it's really more of a precursor to qualified immunity as we understand it, which gets established in a case called Harlow v. Fitzgerald, a 1982 case. In that case, there was a Nixon era whistleblower who, probably due to testifying against the Nixon administration, unfairly lost his job, according to him, contracting for the Air Force, and he says that was due to the interference of certain Nixon administration aides. And the Court held that the aides were immune.</p>
                        <p>06:42 Peter: And they created a new, much broader standard. Qualified immunity would apply to government officials unless they were violating a "clearly established right or a clearly established law." So the big change here from the prior case is that this completely gets rid of the question of whether the government official was acting in good faith, basically meaning that we're moving from questioning the officer's motives to a circumstance where we're essentially trying to create excuses for the officer. We're saying, "Well, was it really clear that the officer was violating the law?" And the Court in Harlow and subsequent cases stopped talking about the rights being violated and started talking more about how holding government officials liable was disruptive to their work.</p>
                        <p>07:31 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>07:31 Michael: Their busy work of violating your rights.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:33 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:35 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:35 Michael: You don't want to disrupt that.</p>
                        <p>07:36 Peter: Those aides that were wasting time dealing with this lawsuit when they could have been calculating exactly how many Cambodians to annihilate.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:46 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>07:47 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>07:47 Rhiannon: So to put it plainly, qualified immunity is a legal doctrine, and it's meant to keep government officials from being sued for violating an area, say, of the Constitution that's unclear. So to give an example, we're actually going to talk about this case later in this episode, but consider clearly established Fourth Amendment rules, for instance. We know, for example, that the Fourth Amendment clearly establishes that the cops cannot go inside your home without a warrant. And we know also, there are some clearly established exceptions to the warrant requirement. For example, if the cops show up at your house and you give them consent to enter your home, then they don't need a warrant. That's an exception to the warrant requirement.</p>
                        <p>08:29 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>08:29 Rhiannon: But there are new situations, new constitutional questions coming up all the time because, of course, the pigs get creative with how they violate people's rights. So in one case, the circumstances are that someone gives consent for the cops to enter her home without a warrant, but what the cops do with that consent is fill the house with tear gas instead of going inside. So the question for qualified immunity purposes to see whether the cops can be held liable is whether the cops knew that the tear gas entry was clearly a violation of the Constitution. And what that means is that, essentially, you have to be able to present a case with effectively the exact same facts as a case that happened before in order for your right to be clearly established.</p>
                        <p>09:19 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>09:19 Peter: Right. So that's what happens over the course of the next several decades following the Harlow v. Fitzgerald in 1982. The courts take this sort of somewhat reasonable limitation on Section 1983, and they turn it into this massive sprawling loophole by leaning on the vagueness of the term "clearly established law." And it's like every case is obviously factually different to some degree, and so they find those little differences and say, "Well, this one's sort of new when you think about it. So the officer wasn't violating a clearly established law." And the result is that we have near complete immunity for police officers when judges feel like giving it to them, frankly.</p>
                        <p>10:01 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:02 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>10:02 Peter: For example, in a case called Thompson v. Marr, police were executing a search warrant on a known drug dealer. They saw a pickup truck near his home, and they said that they felt that whoever owned that pickup might have tipped him off to their warrant, despite having absolutely no reason to believe that. Because of that, they execute a no-knock warrant, meaning they do not knock on his door and wait for him to answer. Instead they shout, "Police!" And they immediately knocked down the door with a fucking battering ram. He walks out of the bedroom naked, holding a gun, which by the way, probably not the most irrational reaction to the sound of a battering ram knocking down your front door.</p>
                        <p>10:41 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>10:42 Peter: They immediately shoot him dead, and then they hold his girlfriend at gun point while she holds her baby, before making her pass the baby to them through a broken window.</p>
                        <p>10:53 Rhiannon: Oh, my God. Jesus.</p>
                        <p>10:55 Peter: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the famously liberal circuit that Trump likes to complain about, held that the officers were entitled to immunity because it was reasonable for them to believe that they were not violating a clearly established law when they busted in his house because they saw a pickup truck nearby.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:18 Rhiannon: Cool.</p>
                        <p>11:18 Michael: What the fuck? It's such garbage.</p>
                        <p>11:22 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:22 Rhiannon: It's bad, guys. It's bad.</p>
                        <p>11:25 Peter: I think it's obvious that we believe that this sort of police conduct violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. Shooting someone is technically a seizure under the Fourth Amendment under the law. And I want to clarify my thoughts on this, because police will say, "Look, this guy exited his room with a gun. How can it be a constitutional violation to shoot him?" And in a vacuum, that may seem persuasive, but these situations don't exist in a vacuum. If the actions of police have led to a circumstance where it is completely reasonable for a person to grab their weapon, then you can't just kill them for doing that and claim it's totally constitutional. If the police purposefully create the conditions that lead to a situation where they have no choice but to shoot someone, then that should be just as much of a constitutional violation as a circumstance where they shoot someone for no reason.</p>
                        <p>12:19 Rhiannon: Right, ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>12:21 Michael: And so these cases we're talking about how just fucking transparently obvious the rights should be, like the idea that these rights aren't clearly established is absurd. But, obviously, there are going to be cases that are not that transparently obviously a constitutional violation, but nonetheless, resemble earlier cases where the courts have made a ruling and said, "This is what excessive force looks like." But the thing is, if you think that might help the situation, you'd be wrong, because the courts really just don't give a shit.</p>
                        <p>12:54 Peter: Yeah, they do not clarify what is or is not excessive force or a constitutional violation or whatever you might call it.</p>
                        <p>13:00 Michael: At all. And so a nice example of that is in the Sixth Circuit back in 2011, there was a man who had a shotgun and he was lowering it, and cops shot and killed him. And the court found that that actually was excessive force because he was lowering the shotgun. He was demonstrating that he was not a threat. So a couple of years later, a 14-year-old boy was holding a BB gun at gunpoint from the cops, he drops the BB gun, he puts his hands up, the cops shoot him in the shoulder. And so you think, well, look, if you shoot someone who's lowering his weapon and that's excessive force, then clearly, that's a clearly established law that shooting a kid who already dropped his BB gun would also be excessive force.</p>
                        <p>13:47 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>13:47 Michael: But you would be wrong, because the court said, "Well, look, the kid, he drew the BB gun from his waistband first, and there wasn't a similar drawing of weapon in the previous case."</p>
                        <p>14:00 Rhiannon: What?</p>
                        <p>14:01 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:03 Michael: So...</p>
                        <p>14:04 Peter: You're supposed to just shake it down your pants. You just sort of shake it till it falls out your pant leg. If you don't do that, you're dead, kid.</p>
                        <p>14:11 Rhiannon: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>14:14 Michael: So it doesn't matter. If the court wants to find a distinction, they can find a distinction, they will.</p>
                        <p>14:20 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. That sort of fine a distinction really highlights what we said up top, which is, this isn't a written law, you don't find this anywhere in the Constitution or in Section 1983, this is judge-made law, and so the cases that come after it are all about judges making these subjective determinations. And so, how the clearly established analysis worked in qualified immunity cases for a while, is that courts would have to decide first, they would have to look at the facts of a case and decide if somebody's constitutional right was violated, and then they would move on to the question of whether or not that right was clearly established at the time the right was violated. But then in 2009, the Supreme Court strengthened qualified immunity even more, in a case called Pearson v. Callahan. And in that case, the Supreme Court basically allowed federal courts to switch the analysis, which is to say that a federal court could decide whether the right was clearly established before deciding if a right had been violated.</p>
                        <p>15:31 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:32 Rhiannon: And so what that means is that in these gray areas of constitutional law, where new situations and circumstances arise of police pushing the boundaries of what is constitutional, in those gray areas, the court can just throw the case out by saying that the law in this area is unclear, instead of doing the work of establishing what the Constitution protects us from.</p>
                        <p>15:54 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:54 Peter: It's important to realize why that's a bad idea, and it's because it's very hard to understand whether something is a "clearly established right," before you really understand what the right is, and this allows them to skip over the question of what the actual right is and whether or not it was violated, before getting to the question of whether it was clearly established.</p>
                        <p>16:14 Peter: Right. The court can really undertake that important responsibility of saying, "Which of these new situations are violations of clearly established constitutional rights? What does the Constitution protect for all of us?" But instead, this case, Pearson versus Callahan, it gives federal courts the ability to just throw out a case by saying, "Well, whatever the right is, it's not clearly established yet," and this is introducing a procedural, technical rule to make it easier for courts to grant qualified immunity.</p>
                        <p>16:42 Michael: Right, and that's exactly how they've used it, right? There was a recent Reuters report that sort of did a survey of all the qualified immunity cases from the last decade, and every time, the courts skipped over the question of whether cops actually used excessive force and went directly to the question of whether the right was clearly established in this situation. Every single time they found that the right was not clearly established and that the cops had qualified immunity.</p>
                        <p>17:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>17:13 Michael: It's just a way to cut to the chase and hold cops.</p>
                        <p>17:15 Peter: It's a way of avoiding the nuance of the actual rights in question.</p>
                        <p>17:20 Rhiannon: Exactly, right.</p>
                        <p>17:20 Michael: Right. And this creates a sort of a second order problem, because what happens is these cases don't create precedent for future cases of similar conduct, because the law remains unclear, right?</p>
                        <p>17:31 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>17:32 Michael: So the court doesn't actually make a decision on the merits, so if this situation comes up again, and the court has to face it again, they can't look at their past decision and say, "Well, we decided that was excessive force."</p>
                        <p>17:42 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:43 Michael: And this hasn't happened a lot, but it has happened. So the example that I have here, is in the Eleventh Circuit, which is kind of in the South, dealing with this practice called hogtying, which is where cops handcuff you behind your back, shackle your ankles, and then attach the ankle shackles to the handcuffs. And so what you had in 2009 in Florida, was cops hogtying someone, and that person dying as a result of the stress position their body was in, and cops putting their body weight on them and pinning them to the ground, and the court deciding to skip over the question of whether that was excessive force and just saying, "Well, look, in this case, it's not clearly established law whether that's excessive force, so cops have qualified immunity here, and we're throwing the case out." And so in 2013, cops in Alabama also killed someone after hogtying him, right back up to the Eleventh Circuit, and they, again, found the cops had qualified immunity, because the law was still unclear, it's still not clearly established.</p>
                        <p>18:48 Rhiannon: Because they didn't answer it in the first case.</p>
                        <p>18:50 Peter: Right, it's wild. On one hand, they're refusing to clarify and then they're saying, "Well, it's not clear enough, sorry."</p>
                        <p>18:55 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>18:56 Michael: And so in the last decade since Pearson, before this case, when cops tried to claim qualified immunity, they won about 45% of the time, and now, they lose about 45% of the time. So it's been a steady chipping away at your ability to hold them liable.</p>
                        <p>19:14 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:15 Peter: Right. It's time for an ad.</p>
                        <p>19:20 Peter: So the most recent Supreme Court case directly addressing qualified immunity is Mullenix v. Luna, 2015 case. In that case, there was a high-speed chase. This guy is running from the police, calls them and says he has a gun and will use it if the police don't give up the chase. Police lay out a spike strip to stop the car. One officer wanted to open fire from an overpass with a rifle into the car just before it hit the spike strip.</p>
                        <p>19:50 Rhiannon: This is insanely dangerous. I know you don't learn a lot at the pig academy. You do learn that shooting into a speeding car, from a bridge, onto the highway, is really fucking dangerous. You do learn that.</p>
                        <p>20:06 Michael: I didn't even go to pig academy and I can tell.</p>
                        <p>20:09 Rhiannon: Neither did I, but I'm sure that's in their curriculum. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:12 Peter: Yeah, they cover that in the week and a half that they spend training.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:15 Rhiannon: Right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>20:16 Peter: So this guy's boss tells him, "No, don't do that."</p>
                        <p>20:21 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:21 Peter: He does it anyway, opening fire into the car and killing the suspect, and reportedly saying, in reference to a performance review that said he needed to be more proactive, "How about that for proactive?"</p>
                        <p>20:35 Rhiannon: Fuck.</p>
                        <p>20:38 Peter: By the way, first name Chadrin, CHADRIN.</p>
                        <p>20:42 Rhiannon: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>20:44 Peter: You know you're raising a murderer when you name him Chadrin.</p>
                        <p>20:46 Rhiannon: If you wrote the joke, Peter, that his name was Chadrin Mullenix, it'd be unbelievable.</p>
                        <p>20:52 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Rhiannon: God damn, I hate these people.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Peter: So the Court holds, again, 8-1, that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity. Sotomayor wrote a fairly scathing dissent, saying, "Of course, this would clearly violate the Constitution, you can't use deadly force unless it's necessary." And then she kind of has some asides, saying that the Court is endorsing a "shoot first think later" mentality and stated that it rendered the promises of the Fourth Amendment hollow. One notable thing here is that the officer claims he was aiming for the engine block to disable the car. Keep in mind this story makes no actual sense. Why shoot out the engine of a car that is a split second away from a spike strip?</p>
                        <p>21:34 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>21:34 Peter: Also, he was using a rifle that he was well trained with, he fired six shots and four hit this dude's upper body.</p>
                        <p>21:42 Michael: Jesus.</p>
                        <p>21:43 Peter: In other words, the story about aiming for the engine was clearly made up after the fact, and you'd have to be an absolute fucking moron to believe it. But lucky for the police, Antonin Scalia was still on the Supreme Court at the time. And he files a concurrence saying, "Yeah, yeah, the majority is totally right, he deserves qualified immunity." But also, I don't think that this qualifies as, "deadly force, because he was aiming at the engine block." This is not relevant to the case. He just thinks it's unfair to the police to call it deadly force.</p>
                        <p>22:17 Michael: Jesus.</p>
                        <p>22:17 Rhiannon: It's insane. We've talked about felony murder. You want to tell me that just not intending deadly force makes it not deadly force, when you have people who were lookouts during a burglary.</p>
                        <p>22:30 Peter: You can get into a really stupid technical law school discussion of whether shooting near somebody is deadly force, but also, you'd have to be an absolute moron to think that this guy was aiming for the engine. So it's sort of irrelevant and became even more irrelevant in February 2016, when Antonin Scalia's pillow applied deadly force to his face.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:53 Rhiannon: Got his ass.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:00 Peter: Where's his grave? We should let our listeners know at one point.</p>
                        <p>23:02 Michael: Anybody wants to relieve themselves publicly.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:08 Michael: Yes. And so, we've been going over the doctrine itself, how it works, how courts apply it, and how that can sort of put a thumb on the scale in these cases, but it's not the only way that the Supreme Court helps police here. One of the ways is what cases the Supreme Court hears. And so for example, plaintiffs and cop defendants send qualified immunity cases up to the Supreme Court at roughly the same rate. And despite that, of the 15 qualified immunity cases the Court has heard in the last 15 years, 12 of the 15 have been where cops were appealing the fact that they were denied qualified immunity, which sort of communicates to lower courts what the Supreme Court is concerned about, is lower courts being too aggressive in denying cops qualified immunity.</p>
                        <p>24:00 Michael: And the courts clearly understand that. We can see that in the decline in successful challenges against cops in these cases. And if those numbers don't sound that meaningful, the Court is three times as likely to take an appeal from a cop who's upset that they didn't get qualified immunity than it is to take literally any other type of appeal. They just take them at a very high rate. And there's all sorts of other little rules. They allow what's called interlocutory appeal, which is where you can appeal a qualified immunity ruling before the case is over. There are other things that are available to that, but it is a special dispensation that says you don't have to go through trial, you don't have to get to a resolution, if the Court decides you don't have qualified immunity, officer, you can appeal that immediately.</p>
                        <p>24:46 Michael: It also... Cops can get qualified immunity before discovery is complete, which means that you don't even get a full finding of fact on what happened. So all of this operates in a way to keep what the cops do sort of shielded from the public and keep the cops themselves shielded from liability.</p>
                        <p>25:08 Peter: Right. As we mentioned up top, the Supreme Court could have chosen to revisit the qualified immunity doctrine next term, but instead denied review to each of the 13 pending petitions for certiorari.</p>
                        <p>25:21 Rhiannon: Yeah, sometimes called a petition for cert.</p>
                        <p>25:24 Peter: To give you a flavor of just how horrific some of these cases are, we want to go through a couple of them. So Rhiannon mentioned earlier, the case West v. Winfield. In that case, a woman returned home with her kids, to find five police officers outside. They tell her they're looking for her ex-boyfriend. She says she doesn't think he's there, but she gives them permission to go in and she gives them her key. But instead of utilizing the key, they call in SWAT and they bombard her house with tear gas from the outside, essentially laying siege to her house. After many hours, after the house and everything inside has been severely damaged by fucking tear gas, the police determine the house is empty.</p>
                        <p>26:18 Rhiannon: Whoa. [laughter] I wonder if there was another tool you could have used.</p>
                        <p>26:22 Peter: Great question and no, the answer is no. [laughter] Also, even though she had given them the key, the way they ultimately got inside after tear gassing the house is they broke a window near the back door and they reached in and unlocked it.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:36 Rhiannon: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>26:40 Michael: I hate them so much.</p>
                        <p>26:41 Rhiannon: Oh, God. I hate them.</p>
                        <p>26:41 Peter: So the famously liberal Ninth Circuit held that the officers were immune from suit because it is not clearly established that gas bombing someone's house is a violation of the Constitution if they give you consent to enter. Alright. Some other cases involve cops who unleashed a police dog on a suspect who had surrendered and was sitting on the ground with his hands up; an officer who parked his patrol car with his sirens on outside a man's house for an hour, knocking and looking into windows, disabling home security cameras, all so he could administer a breathalyzer to a man on probation.</p>
                        <p>27:24 Rhiannon: God.</p>
                        <p>27:25 Peter: And an officer who chased a suspect into a yard where children were playing, had the children lay down while they detained the suspect, who was cooperating. Then repeatedly tried to shoot a pet dog, but missed and hit the 10-year-old child who was lying a foot-and-a-half away.</p>
                        <p>27:45 Rhiannon: My God.</p>
                        <p>27:47 Peter: So, I'm sorry, but if a prestigious appellate court can see a cop shoot at a family's pet dog for no reason, miss and hit a child, and claim that he did not violate a clearly established constitutional right, then what the fuck are we even talking about here?</p>
                        <p>28:04 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>28:05 Peter: What is this?</p>
                        <p>28:05 Rhiannon: It's a fucking joke, is what it is.</p>
                        <p>28:07 Peter: That on its face is enough to make it clear that this doctrine is out of control and has no tangible connection to what we should expect of a legal system that defends our constitutional rights.</p>
                        <p>28:16 Rhiannon: Yeah, can I just talk like my religious shit again for a minute? This is why I don't believe in an afterlife, because hell, hell, like eternal hell fire, is too nice a place for fucking people who let this shit go. The cops who are just shooting fucking randomly, judges who are like, "That's a-okay. It wasn't clear that that's wrong." Hell is too good a place, so we need justice in this lifetime, is what I'm saying.</p>
                        <p>28:42 Peter: What's the story that's just, hell being a room with a bunch of other people that you have to talk to?</p>
                        <p>28:49 Rhiannon: L'enfer, c'est les autres.</p>
                        <p>28:50 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:51 Peter: With cops, it's just...</p>
                        <p>28:52 Michael: There you go.</p>
                        <p>28:52 Peter: It's having to talk to a minority for 25 minutes.</p>
                        <p>28:56 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:56 Peter: That's the equivalent of an eternity of hell fire.</p>
                        <p>28:58 Michael: That's their equivalent.</p>
                        <p>29:00 Peter: They're just like, "Oh, my God, I've gotta shoot a dog. I absolutely have to."</p>
                        <p>29:05 Michael: And I just want to say, listener, if you're still on the fence, if you're like, "There are some good cops and maybe they deserve some immunity," or if the facts of this case seem very sort of shocking to you, just know that cops kill at least 30 dogs a day, over 10,000 a year...</p>
                        <p>29:21 Rhiannon: God.</p>
                        <p>29:22 Michael: There isn't a comprehensive database of it, so we can't be certain, but that's like the fucking floor, that's the minimum.</p>
                        <p>29:28 Peter: That's the minimum...</p>
                        <p>29:28 Michael: That's the minimum.</p>
                        <p>29:31 Peter: Ten thousand dogs a year. This is an extinction level event for dogs.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>29:39 Peter: Alright, we should note a couple of things. One is that qualified immunity... A lot of these cases are horrific and egregious, but it's not frequently invoked. I think it's best viewed as sort of part and parcel with this massive system that benefits the police. The way that prosecutors operate, the way that judges operate, the way that juries are biased and designed to be biased towards police officers. This system is like... It's massive and it needs to be hacked at steadily to see any real progress on it.</p>
                        <p>30:11 Michael: One thing to be aware of is that when qualified immunity is not invoked, that doesn't necessarily mean that there is accountability for the officer. If there's a settlement or if the city loses in court, the vast majority, if not all the time, the people paying for that are the taxpayers. That's not coming out of police budgets, it's not coming out of cops' pay or their pensions, or anything... That's taxpayers paying for that brutality. So accountability, it's not a word that really exists in this space, whether or not qualified immunity is invoked at all, or if it's... Whether or not it's successfully invoked.</p>
                        <p>30:52 Peter: Right, right. But what's important is that, right now, you can see that its foundational assumptions are shaky in the view of the public. And the sort of assumption that cops need some element of freedom to do their jobs is being questioned, or at least the scope of it is being questioned. In my view, it's not just that qualified immunity needs to be revisited and abolished by the Court because it's bad law. When the Court makes up a rule purely out of its own conception of what is fair or not, and there's a huge growing chorus of people stating that it is in fact unfair, then in my opinion, the Court has a responsibility to address that, because this doctrine isn't predicated on a statute or anything else tangible, it's the pure manifestation of the Court's policy preferences. And in those circumstances, the Court should be particularly quick to revisit and revise the rules it makes.</p>
                        <p>31:49 Michael: And look, the liberals are just as big a part of the problem here as the conservatives.</p>
                        <p>31:56 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>31:57 Michael: And it's not hard to do the math on this. You only need four votes to get one of these cases heard. You don't need five votes, you just need four Justices to say, "I want to hear one of these cases. I want to hear the guy trying to shoot a dog and shooting a kid instead." And you'll hear it. And Justice Thomas, actually, in a very rare move, dissented from the Court deciding not to hear one of these and said, "We should hear it, publicly." He wrote an opinion about it.</p>
                        <p>32:22 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>32:22 Michael: That's one vote. And Sotomayor has been very vocal, very open about wanting to revisit qualified immunity, so that's two. You had a minimum of two out of the four votes you needed, which means you couldn't get two more out of Kagan, Breyer and Ginsburg. So max one of those people is not a piece of shit, but my guess is all three of them are garbage, based on their past votes and all three of them were like, "Yeah, fine, fucking sic a dog on a guy who's already surrendered. Why not?"</p>
                        <p>32:58 Rhiannon: And what's so ridiculous, I... Just to emphasize again, like Michael said, this is judge-made doctrine, and so the solution is also completely judge-made. Congress hasn't acted here, another branch of government has not acted here, that would sort of in other situations counsel hesitation and counsel judicial restraint on the part of the Supreme Court. What's actually happened here is, 50 years ago, the Court came up with this doctrine and they could fix it and they're deciding not to.</p>
                        <p>33:30 Michael: Right. I think the only conclusion you can draw from what Peter and Rhiannon and I have all said, taken together, is that the state of qualified immunity as it exists now is an accurate representation of the policy preferences of seven Supreme Court Justices.</p>
                        <p>33:49 Rhiannon: Nailed it. Nailed it. Tell them, king.</p>
                        <p>33:52 Peter: And one other thing I want to highlight, the qualified immunity petitions were rejected in a week where the Court came down on the liberal side of a couple of big cases, Title 7 and DACA, and the result has been a lot of people who are usually frustrated with the Supreme Courts sort of singing its praises a little bit, and conservatives who are very, very frustrated, and many of those conservatives have started writing articles after the DACA decision, especially, that are essentially like, "Is this the end of the conservative legal project?"</p>
                        <p>34:30 Peter: You look at the qualified immunity cases and it's like, "How much more fucking control over American jurisprudence do you need, when you've got numerous liberals in the bag on huge contentious issues? What else do you fucking want?" It's just proof that these people will stop at nothing short of total control of the American judiciary.</p>
                        <p>34:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, and regarding qualified immunity, some Democrats recently have proposed legislation to end qualified immunity. So Ayanna Pressley in the House has proposed the Ending Qualified Immunity Act, which would amend Section 1983 to say that police officers can't use qualified immunity to protect them from liability when they violate people's civil rights. And then some Senate Democrats, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, among others, have proposed the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which in addition to banning no-knock warrants in some cases, and banning racial profiling, side note, that's already not allowed.</p>
                        <p>35:33 Peter: We will be banning all illegal behavior.</p>
                        <p>35:36 Rhiannon: Right, right. Yeah, so in addition to those things, the Justice and Policing Act would get rid of qualified immunity. Now, these pieces of legislation do not have a clear path to getting passed, Republicans are already saying that ending qualified immunity is a poison pill. John Cornyn, Senator from Texas says that policing is "a tough job under any set of circumstances, and to have lawsuits filed which sort of flies back what you did or didn't do at a time when you didn't know whether you know somebody is trying to kill you or not, I think you need that sort of balancing of interest that qualified immunity provides."</p>
                        <p>36:15 Peter: Now, the Democratic proposals are, and I think in our view, a good start. I'm just sort of thinking of what the law would look like, if we were in charge. So obviously, you abolish qualified immunity. But in my view, the real concern is that there are a lot of circumstances where police should be held to a higher standard of conduct than the public and not a lower standard. If police engage in something like petty theft, it makes sense that that should be more severely punished than someone who was not leveraging a position of power to do it, which is why I believe that if they engage in petty theft, they should be executed.</p>
                        <p>36:57 Michael: Capital offense.</p>
                        <p>36:58 Peter: If they sic a dog on an unarmed person, obviously execution; if they're covering their badge, you're going to want to execute.</p>
                        <p>37:07 Michael: Qualified immunity for citizens who reasonably, in good faith, believe that they are acting on these laws. Oh, that cop's badge looks like it's covered, execute them. If they were acting in good faith, all good. Turns out that was just a mustard stain on the badge.</p>
                        <p>37:27 Peter: Yeah. Well, good news, mustard stains on cop uniforms, execution.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:32 Peter: The 5-4 Police Reform Act of 2020.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:39 Michael: So one thing that's worth noting about the Democratic legislation that's good, is that it's not a half measure when it comes to qualified immunity for cops, it's like fucking get rid of it, not like go back to the good faith standard, or any of that. It's just like boom, done, it's out. But it is limited to police and I believe corrections officers, and it's worth noting that, as we said at the beginning, at the top of this episode, qualified immunity as we know it now was invented in a case about a whistleblower being punished by the Nixon administration.</p>
                        <p>38:14 Michael: And you would think maybe that this particular Democratic Congress, dealing with this particular administration and the trouble they've had, getting honest and full, or even any testimony out of them, might be a little more aggressive about like sweeping executive behavior into this as well, in eliminating qualified immunity there, there's definitely at least hints at political retributive firings in the Trump administration, where qualified immunity might come into play in a few years. It's not out of the question.</p>
                        <p>38:48 Peter: Yeah, no, absolutely. We're talking about this in a police-driven context because the broader public discussion is driven by police brutality issues. But qualified immunity is broad, it applies to government officials broadly, and that covers a lot of ground, and yes, I think the police abuses are the most visceral, but that doesn't mean that they're the only ones, and it doesn't even mean that they're the worst.</p>
                        <p>39:09 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:10 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>39:10 Peter: As we wrap up here, I want to note one thing, which is that Section 1983 is a law that allows people to sue the government for violating their constitutional rights, that is the purpose of the law. The doctrine of qualified immunity completely upends and undermines that purpose. The Court has stepped in with a rule saying, "Look, we can't just let people sue every government official who violates their rights, that causes too many problems." But that was the whole point of the statute.</p>
                        <p>39:37 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>39:38 Peter: That's why it exists. Conservatives will very frequently talk about how courts can't interfere with the will of Congress. But is there a more egregious example of that exact phenomenon than this?</p>
                        <p>39:49 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>39:50 Peter: Congress passes a law to allow people to hold government officials accountable, and the Court steps in and says, "Well, no, that actually bothers the government officials too much. Sorry, we can't do it."</p>
                        <p>40:00 Rhiannon: Yeah. Right.</p>
                        <p>40:00 Peter: And I know we've talked a lot about conservative hypocrisy on this podcast, but this is why you can't ever stop beating that drum, because this is fucking absurd. A completely made up doctrine meant to limit a statute passed by Congress, 100 years prior to the development of this doctrine, the Court just steps in like, "No, no, no, we don't really like how this is panning out."</p>
                        <p>40:21 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>40:22 Peter: Not that I think the Court should never be able to do that, but certainly the conservatives on the Court have frequently said that you can't do that.</p>
                        <p>40:28 Rhiannon: Yeah. And it's important to highlight too, I think, the way that a conservative Court leverages the idea of judicial activism versus judicial restraint. So conservatives will say that stepping in and creating judge-made doctrine, that's judicial activism, we don't do that, we need to let Congress speak, but then they'll turn around here and create qualified immunity and make it so that no government officials are held liable, but they'll say that's restraint too, because they're restraining cases that are coming before the Court.</p>
                        <p>41:01 Peter: So, the last thing I want to say about qualified immunity is, Section 1983 is a statute about your ability to protect and enforce your own constitutional rights, by suing the government and government officials when they violate them.</p>
                        <p>41:16 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>41:16 Peter: But the way the courts have approached qualified immunity cases, the court barely discusses the civil rights of the person suing; instead, the focus is almost entirely on the officer. "Should they have known that they were violating your rights? Were your rights clearly established?" And these questions are sophistry. They're entirely detached from what should be the central question of whether your rights were actually violated.</p>
                        <p>41:42 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>41:42 Peter: The entire inquiry is made up by the court, a completely artificial barrier standing between individuals and the vindication of their constitutional rights. And the result is a regime that places the comfort of government officials over the rights of its citizens. You can see this play out all across the country in all of the prominent public-facing cases that we see. And plenty of the ones that aren't so public-facing, that don't get public attention. The George Floyd case is not yet about qualified immunity, but certainly when it reaches the court it's going to be about what the cops should have known about rights in the Constitution, as opposed to the much more salient fact that some guy who committed a very petty crime, at worst, had his fucking neck leaned on for nine minutes until he died. And any fucking person who's not an absolute psychopath knows that not only is that wrong, but of course it's a violation of the Constitution, what could the Constitution possibly mean if that's not a violation of it? The discussion as courts are having it now is completely separate from the human beings that suffer under the weight of government authority.</p>
                        <p>43:00 Michael: I don't know that George Floyd is going to have... Be a qualified immunity case, but I feel like that one in Atlanta will be.</p>
                        <p>43:04 Rhiannon: Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't... If you just think about what the facts are in these cases, I wouldn't be able to lean on the neck of an animal for nine minutes. What is really happening, even though we're desensitized and the violence that police enact on the people is so normalized that we accept it. But if my boss told me, "No, do not shoot into a speeding car," and then I did it anyway. The facts of these cases are...</p>
                        <p>43:33 Peter: If my boss told me not to send an email, and I sent it anyway, I would get a fucking warning, a written warning.</p>
                        <p>43:39 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly. And what the court turns around and does, and I think we pointed this out in Hernandez v. Mesa, and in that case, it was with... The case is called Bivens, and the doctrines that come out of that, that the court used to abdicate its role in accountability. But here we see that the judge-made doctrine, the courts create their own law to abdicate their responsibility to make itself a weaker institution, where they're not saying, "Yes, institution of government officials, yes, police, we're going to police you, we're going to hold you accountable." They brushed their hands of it using qualified immunity.</p>
                        <p>44:19 Michael: Right. So, we've been saying here that there's legislation and there's obviously people out in the streets demanding something happen with qualified immunity, and it's really disappointing that the Supreme Court isn't responding to that. It would be the easiest thing in their world for the Supreme Court to do, they don't really have to do anything, they don't even have to write an opinion, they just have to agree to take up a case next term. But that doesn't mean the courts in general aren't sort of tuning into the moment, and there have been some lower courts that seem to be picking up on where society is pushing and moving accordingly.</p>
                        <p>45:00 Michael: A recent case in the Fourth Circuit I think is particularly worth discussing. And so this is a case about a schizophrenic man who is experiencing homelessness, he's walking in the street rather than on a sidewalk. And a cop stops him and starts asking why is he in the street and asks for his ID. The guy says he doesn't have ID. The cop asks him if he has any weapons, the guy asks what counts as a weapon, and when the cop says that knives count as weapons, he says, "Well, yeah, I'm holding something." It turns out he has a little pen knife, basically, in his sleeve.</p>
                        <p>45:35 Michael: The cop immediately freaks out, calls for back-up, starts yelling at him to put his hands on the hood of his car. The homeless man is getting agitated, saying, "What did I do? I didn't do anything wrong." Confused, runs away. Cops give chase. The end result is that five cops tased this guy multiple times, beat the shit out of him, put him in a chokehold, and then they get up, and while he's lying motionless on the ground gurgling, trying to get his breath back, they shoot him 22 times and killed him. The district court found that the cops had qualified immunity, and the Fourth Circuit reversed.</p>
                        <p>46:22 Michael: And this is what they wrote at the end, this guy's name was Wayne Jones, and they say, "Wayne Jones was killed just over one year before the Ferguson, Missouri shooting of Michael Brown would once again draw national scrutiny to police shootings of black people in the United States. Seven years later, we are asked to decide whether it was clearly established that five officers could not shoot a man 22 times as he lay motionless on the ground. Although we recognize that our police officers are often asked to make split-second decisions, we expect them to do so with respect for the dignity and worth of black lives."</p>
                        <p>46:57 Michael: Before the ink dried on this opinion, the FBI opened an investigation into yet another death of a black man at the hands of police, this time George Floyd in Minneapolis. This has to stop. To award qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage in this case would signal absolute immunity for fear-based use of deadly force, which we cannot accept. District court is reversed.</p>
                        <p>47:21 Rhiannon: Yeah. And I think it's so important that, even though we talk about the law and concepts that feel really sort of abstract and irrelevant to daily life, that we emphasize that really all of this stuff has such a huge impact on our communities, on real families, on people who have suffered at the hands of police in this country. And so maybe to wrap up, we just want to say, rest in peace and power to Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, Michael Brown, Tony McDade, Philando Castile, Atatiana Jefferson, and so many others who have either had their lives taken too soon, or been really hurt and injured by the police.</p>
                        <p>48:14 Peter: Hell, yeah, rest in peace.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>48:25 Michael: Okay. So we mentioned the good decisions last week, and obviously we gave you guys an emergency podcast about the LGBTQ Title VII cases. We also want to take just a short minute or two to tell you about the DACA decision. This is a really complicated case, it sits at the intersection of a lot of areas of law, immigration law, the administrative state, equal protection. And we're not going to cover all that. So, the Supreme Court essentially prevented the Trump administration from ending this extremely popular Obama-era program called DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p>
                        <p>49:05 Michael: Basically, DACA gives protections to 700,000 or so people who came to the US as young undocumented children and have lived here ever since, and it's basically their entire lives. And the way it works is they apply, as long as they're not like felons and meet some basic requirements, they get this protected status, which means that the government can't deport them for two years and they can work legally, they get social security, they can get driver's licenses and all sorts of stuff, there are a lot of benefits that attach to it. And at the end of the two-year period they can renew it.</p>
                        <p>49:40 Michael: And it essentially allows them to participate fully in the American civic life. And the majority of these people are undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and Donald Trump fucking hates Mexicans because he's like a vile racist. You may or may not be aware that he wants to build a wall [chuckle] down there, and so he's vowed to end this program. And the thing is, it's not a law. Under Obama, the Department of Homeland Security just announced this policy via executive memorandum. And so Trump unquestionably has the power to end this. But skipping over a lot of the other shit, the basic question here is whether DHS complied with the procedural requirements that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action when it said it was going to end DACA, which was just a weird function of the administrative state that they can't just do stuff arbitrarily.</p>
                        <p>50:40 Michael: And Roberts is basically telling the Trump administration here in rejecting them, and saying that DACA still stands at least for now, like, "Look, don't make us look like clowns. Don't lie to our faces in such an egregious way that I will look like a fucking idiot for buying it. If you're going to lie to our faces, at least make it look good." And it's a lot like the Muslim ban case that we talked about, Trump v. Hawaii, which was very similar. In both cases you have Trump with these really racist inflammatory statements, and in both cases you have an effort to paper over those with some minimal procedure. In the Muslim ban case, the Court said, they did a good enough job of papering over with procedure. And here they said, "You didn't, you're too lazy, you're too arrogant to do this right, to even go through the basic motions." And honestly, I can't blame Trump, because four out of the five conservative justices were ready to go along with him.</p>
                        <p>51:38 Peter: Yep.</p>
                        <p>51:40 Michael: So this is a victory, it's great. There are hundreds of thousands of people who get to sleep a lot easier now, but it doesn't end the issue, it didn't say DACA is constitutional, it didn't say Trump has to keep his hands off it. There's still other litigation about this going through the federal courts, and the Trump administration can now use Roberts' opinion as a roadmap for how to properly go about ending DACA.</p>
                        <p>52:03 Peter: And it seems like that was his intent, at least with portions of it. He rejected all of the arguments that would have found the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle DACA unconstitutional, and instead basically said, "Yes, you sure can do this, but you just did it wrong."</p>
                        <p>52:20 Michael: Right. And so all he has to do is look at all the places where Roberts said his procedures and arguments were deficient and fix them.</p>
                        <p>52:29 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>52:29 Michael: Now, just because of the way administrative law works, they probably do not have enough time to do that in the next few months, so this basically just puts the fate of DACA and DREAMers on the ballot in November. And even then, there's still the outside chance that some of the cases currently making their way through the courts could also end it. And so, the only way to fully protect these people is to pass this as legislation, that's the truth. But that doesn't take away from the fact that, at the very least, these people get to be safer and sleep easier, at least for the next few months, which is a real victory.</p>
                        <p>53:11 Peter: Until Joe Biden comes and saves them.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>53:13 Michael: There you go. There you go.</p>
                        <p>53:14 Peter: Joe Biden, also a DREAMer, in the sense that he experiences physical life in the same way that you probably experience a dream.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>53:29 Peter: Alright. Next episode is Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31. [chuckle] That is the full name of the case. We will be referring to it as Janus. It's about public sector unions. I'll let you guess how that one shook out.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>53:51 Peter: And we've got another guest, Professor Sam Bagenstos is going to join us and he's going to say smart stuff while we make jokes.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>

                        <p>00:01 [Archival]: We'll hear argument this morning in case 07-219, Exxon Shipping Company v. Baker et al.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:10 Leon: Hey, everyone. This is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are discussing Exxon Shipping v. Baker, a case in which Alaska's residents and businesses sued for damages after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.</p>
                        <p>00:26 [Archival]: It was the worst environmental disaster in United States history, killing more wildlife than any other previous catastrophe. On top of that, some 60,000 Alaskans, most involved in fishing, say the oil spill hurt their lives and livelihood.</p>
                        <p>00:42 Leon: The Court cut the amount of punitive damages owed by Exxon to one-tenth of what was originally awarded by the jury and effectively capped damages in similar cases. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>01:02 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the cases that have swarmed American life like locusts over a grassy plane. I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy. I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:15 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:19 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:21 Rhiannon: Hello.</p>
                        <p>01:21 Peter: And today, we are discussing Exxon Shipping v. Baker, a case about the famous Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989. The Exxon Valdez spill, it happens in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989, and it was at the time the worst oil spill in American history. And I think generally speaking, spills from oil tankers were a huge environmental concern until about 2010 when British Petroleum figured out a way to cut out the middleman and pump oil directly from the Earth's crust into our oceans.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:04 Rhiannon: Oh, no.</p>
                        <p>02:04 Michael: God.</p>
                        <p>02:04 Peter: That's what innovation looks like, okay? So this is a case about damages. Exxon was sued for the spill by Alaskan residents and others who depend on the area for their livelihoods. Not Prince William himself, despite the Sound being named after him, I don't know why, abstained. Exxon loses in a trial and they are ordered to pay $5 billion in punitive damages. That amount gets lowered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to $2.5 billion, and here the Supreme Court held that even that was too much, lowering the damages to $500 million, which is about 10% of the original amount, and in the process, they effectively capped the punitive damages available in maritime aka seafaring cases.</p>
                        <p>03:00 Peter: This is another case where the Court just pulls a rule out of its ass and that rule just so happens to benefit the interest of wealthy and powerful people. Alright, as we'll discuss in a bit, limiting the ability of plaintiffs to recover damages in litigation has long been a key part of the conservative effort to limit the liability of corporations, to keep their costs down, and it's predicated in a very real belief held by corporatist conservatives that the American legal system is biased not against any marginalized groups, but against corporations.</p>
                        <p>03:39 Peter: Authoring the majority opinion, here is David Souter, a complete non-entity who's mostly notable for being nominated by George Bush Sr, and then ending up being a liberal. This was back in the late '80s when Republicans were just not very cut-throat about nominations. They were running scared, they had had a couple go poorly and one fail completely, and as a result, they nominated some pretty centristy folks, and Souter ended up being the farthest left. The only other real notable thing about him is that he is, by a very solid margin, the worst writer of the last 30 or so years, I think, on the Court.</p>
                        <p>04:22 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>04:22 Michael: Awful.</p>
                        <p>04:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think one thing to know about Souter is that if you were in law school at the time and you were like, "Oh, yeah, I need to name the nine Justices on the Supreme Court," you're always gonna forget Souter.</p>
                        <p>04:35 Peter: That's right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:37 Rhiannon: But yeah, he's not... You're gonna be like, "Who's that other white guy, dumbass," it's not gonna come to you.</p>
                        <p>04:43 Peter: That's right. So yeah, I guess nothing else interesting to say about him, he was usually on the liberal side, certainly good as far as Republican-nominated Justices go.</p>
                        <p>04:54 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>04:56 Peter: But he mostly sucked, just like the rest of them. He's dead, right?</p>
                        <p>05:02 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>05:03 Rhiannon: I don't think so. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:03 Peter: Souter's still alive?</p>
                        <p>05:03 Michael: No, I think he just retired, yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:06 Peter: Yeah, he... Well, he definitely retired. I thought he also died.</p>
                        <p>05:07 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>05:07 Rhiannon: Hold on, I'll check.</p>
                        <p>05:07 Michael: No, it's Stevens, Stevens died.</p>
                        <p>05:11 Peter: Well, I know, Stevens was 150, but... [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>05:14 Rhiannon: He's alive.</p>
                        <p>05:15 Peter: Souter's alive?</p>
                        <p>05:16 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:16 Michael: I thought he's still doing stuff like Emeritus or I don't know how to pronounce that word.</p>
                        <p>05:21 Peter: I think it's Emeritus.</p>
                        <p>05:23 Michael: Emeritus. No, but O'Connor was doing it for a while too. I think he still hears cases in the DC Circuit, no? Or am I making that up? I might be making that up.</p>
                        <p>05:31 Peter: I don't know. Obviously, I don't know, I thought he was dead.</p>
                        <p>05:32 Rhiannon: He's 81.</p>
                        <p>05:34 Michael: Yeah, he's not that old for...</p>
                        <p>05:35 Peter: Wait, when did he retire, '09?</p>
                        <p>05:37 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:38 Peter: Alright, so I think we should get into the background here. So Rhiannon, walk us through the Exxon Valdez oil spill.</p>
                        <p>05:47 Rhiannon: Yeah, I'm really excited about this, because if you thought this podcast was only about human suffering, well, today we're talking about oil-drenched sea otters and dead Free Willies. [chuckle] So I'm just mixing it up a little bit.</p>
                        <p>06:01 Michael: Spread it around.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>06:03 Rhiannon: Right, right. This case comes out of the famous Exxon Valdez oil spill, like Peter said. It happened in March 1989 when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran into a reef in the Prince William Sound off the coast of Alaska. Like Peter said, it's now the second largest oil spill in US waters, but many scientists say that in terms of environmental impact, this is the worst one in history. So how millions of gallons of oil are spilled into the ocean is of course about corporate greed, but the particular facts and background are important here, I think, because after years of lawsuits, investigation, a lot of really good investigative journalism that uncovered what really happened, what led to this disaster, it becomes clear that Exxon's sheer disdain for the law, their ducking of accountability, and their overall unbending commitment to their bottom line, are at the heart of this environmental catastrophe, and the Supreme Court rushes in here, in this case, to protect them. And by them, I mean Exxon-motherfucking-Mobil, the oil company.</p>
                        <p>07:10 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>07:11 Rhiannon: Okay? The Court says in this case, that they're "worse than negligent, but less than malicious," and I think a quick rundown of the facts that I'm about to tell you, that gives you everything that a kindergartener could use to determine that this corporation absolutely fucking sucks, to its core, and they suck on purpose with no regard for the consequences to any species, human or not. So the ship was carrying more than 50 million gallons of oil and about 11 million gallons were spilled into the Prince William Sound. But it's not a freak accident, it was actually highly foreseeable. First, there are issues with individual crew members. The captain, first of all, was widely reported to have been drinking heavily that night and he was sleeping off his bender when the ship struck the reef. The third mate, who was at the controls, was fatigued and overworked, and he failed to properly maneuver the vessel. Now...</p>
                        <p>08:06 Peter: Third mate? I've heard of first mates, that's the right-hand guy. By the time you get to the third, that's like Bring Your Child to Work day.</p>
                        <p>08:14 Rhiannon: Right, right. Yeah, you got the intern.</p>
                        <p>08:16 Peter: And he, and, "Daddy, what can I do?" And he's like, "You're the third mate, little buddy."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:21 Rhiannon: Yep, they got that guy driving 50 million gallons of oil. But moving to what the corporation did, Exxon Shipping Company, it was determined after the collision, had failed, for a long time, to adequately supervise the captain of the ship, and they also failed to provide a rested and sufficient crew for the ship. The oil industry had also previously promised, but never installed, this sort of high-tech iceberg monitoring equipment on the ships, and the company also failed to maintain the collision avoidance radar System on the ship. If that piece of equipment had been functional, it would have indicated to the third mate that a collision was impending, because it would have detected radar reflectors that were placed in the Prince William Sound for literally this exact purpose of avoiding such collisions. And the radar system, it turns out, wasn't even turned on at the time of the collision, because it was fucking broken, and it had been broken for a year.</p>
                        <p>09:24 Peter: No radar and... They're just out there winging it.</p>
                        <p>09:26 Rhiannon: They're just out there shooting blind.</p>
                        <p>09:28 Michael: They're just...</p>
                        <p>09:28 Peter: 50 million gallons of oil in the fucking Arctic, and they're like, "No, no, we can just... We'll do this blind."</p>
                        <p>09:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, "Watch."</p>
                        <p>09:36 Peter: "Let me know if you see any ice out there."</p>
                        <p>09:37 Rhiannon: "I can do it with no eyes, watch," that's how they're doing this. And documents reveal afterwards that the radar system had been broken for a year, and it's just expensive to maintain and to fix, and so they had left it fucking broken.</p>
                        <p>09:52 Michael: "Fuck it."</p>
                        <p>09:56 Rhiannon: This... [chuckle] Right. This accident happened because the Exxon Valdez had left the normal shipping channel to avoid ice flows, and that's a common occurrence, but it's not what was supposed to happen that night, they're supposed to stay in the channel and just slow down. But of course, time is money, and this is about the bottom line. So of course, 11 million gallons of oil is like, it's an unbelievable amount of oil spilled, but what made this particularly disastrous was Exxon's complete, completely incompetent handling of the disaster immediately following the collision. So I guess something that's widely known in the industry is that ships just like whoopsie-daisy crash all the time, and oil spills are, to some degree, inevitable, so a responsible party would invest in their clean-up and containment capabilities and equipment. It turns out, literally 10 months before this disaster, at a meeting of the six oil companies that own Alaska's oil, a chief of operations warned that it was "not possible to contain an oil spill in the center of the Prince William Sound," which if you're paying attention, is exactly where this happened.</p>
                        <p>11:09 Peter: Where were you, Prince William? Where were you that night?</p>
                        <p>11:14 Rhiannon: And that same chief of operations requested millions of dollars for spill containment equipment. This is equipment that was required by law, and it had already been promised by the companies to regulators, but at that meeting, the proposed spending was voted down by the oil companies.</p>
                        <p>11:31 Peter: Look, as someone who's talked to regulators on behalf of companies from time to time, I feel that. You know what I mean? Cut that. No, I'm kidding.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:44 Rhiannon: Fully four years before the Exxon Valdez collision, the oil group's Valdez port commander warned the company in a confidential letter that, "Due to a reduction in manning, age of equipment, limited training, and lack of personnel, serious doubt exists that we would be able to contain and clean up effectively a medium or large-sized oil spill." And according to that port commander, there had already been a spill at Valdez before this one, but it was, of course, much smaller. And when he went to report it to the government, he said that he was told by his supervisor not to submit the notice, and he was told, "You made a mistake. This was not an oil spill." So just a little Orwellian flavor for you. And as to smaller spills that happened before this collision, even when they were reported to the government, they could have alerted regulators that the oil containment system was not functional, but a lab technician reported after this that she was routinely ordered by management to change test results to eliminate oil in water readings. So she was instructed...</p>
                        <p>12:51 Peter: That's the most important reading, is my guess. Is that right?</p>
                        <p>12:54 Rhiannon: Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>12:56 Peter: It's one of the big ones.</p>
                        <p>12:56 Rhiannon: "Is there oil in the water?" [laughter] She was instructed to dump out oily water and refill the test tubes that were taken from oil spills from a bucket of clean ocean water, and they literally called it "the Miracle Barrel."</p>
                        <p>13:13 Michael: That can't be an accurate way to measure this.</p>
                        <p>13:19 Rhiannon: No, no, I don't think so. This is not a scientifically sound system they have set up. So this is a lot, I know, but it needs to be absolutely clear how fucking wrong they were, and I don't know how the wormy elf David Souter can fix his lips to say that this shit wasn't malicious, but I think if you're lying about test results and the test is on a subject matter that's for sure gonna come up again, and the risk of failing the test is that you devastate thousands of miles of coastline and you murder millions of animals, and you Kill Bill, Achilles heel slice a local economy, I think it's safe to say that you did that shit on purpose. There was malice in your fucking heart.</p>
                        <p>14:00 Rhiannon: And so moving on to the effects. Just in the couple of days after the spill, literally thousands of sea otters were killed, hundreds of thousands of seabirds were dead, and because of the bungled clean up and containment efforts, there is literally still oil on that coastline, and reports say actually that only 10% of the oil was actually cleaned up. In addition, local groups of killer whales lost what some estimate as 40% of their population. It's believed that one group will now just die out soon. Our producer, Katya, you cannot cut out the fact about killer whales because I fucking love killer whales, and this is important to me personally. Have I ever told you guys about seeing killer whales in real life? Like how I reacted?</p>
                        <p>14:48 Michael: No. I mean, they're majestic creatures.</p>
                        <p>14:50 Rhiannon: No, they're fucking incredible in every way. Better than human beings, for sure. And when I saw them...</p>
                        <p>14:57 Michael: Did you cry?</p>
                        <p>14:58 Peter: Don't they actively torture seals for sport?</p>
                        <p>15:01 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:02 Peter: Like, to train their children?</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>15:04 Rhiannon: Yes, they do. So when I saw them in real life, it was like two weeks after graduating from law school, and I saw them in real life off the coast of Washington and the San Juan Islands, and I not only cried, I freaked the fuck out. I was crying so intensely and hyperventilating and jumping up and down that a child on the boat got scared and asked his mom if we were gonna sink. [laughter] I was having that much of an emotional reaction to seeing them that I was literally scaring children. They thought our lives were in danger.</p>
                        <p>15:39 Michael: I was gonna say, I'm picturing Kristen Bell with the sloth, sort of like this...</p>
                        <p>15:43 Rhiannon: Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's me plus killer whales.</p>
                        <p>15:46 Michael: Great.</p>
                        <p>15:46 Peter: I think if there's ever a really good movie made about the Exxon Valdez spill, a good scene would be like a series of cuts where you have someone on the ship, the spill just happens and they're frantically making a call to some guy in a corporate office. He calls an even more important guy, he calls an even more important guy, all of a sudden it's clearly a boardroom, and then he calls a less important guy and a less important guy, and they're all just silently answering the phone and you can't hear what they're saying, and the last one hangs up and walks outside and he's at a gas station and he just raises the price by 25 cents.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>16:20 Rhiannon: He's like, "Problem solved. I got this, guys." Yeah. Okay, so how this case comes to the Supreme Court. Peter said Exxon is sued in Alaska and a jury awarded about $500 million in compensatory damages and $5 billion in punitive damages, which we'll talk about the difference between those things in just a second. True to their evil core, Exxon appealed that verdict, and the Ninth Circuit did order that the punitive damages should be reduced. When it got back to the trial judge, Russel Holland, in Alaska, he reduced the punitive damages to $4 billion, emphasizing that this was not an egregious figure based on the facts of the case, based on the damage that was done by this oil spill. Exxon turns around and appeals that decision, the Ninth Circuit again ordered it back down to Judge Holland, and that time, Judge Holland increased the punitive damages to $4.5 billion plus interest.</p>
                        <p>17:20 Michael: What a fucking king. What a king.</p>
                        <p>17:21 Rhiannon: Yeah, Judge Holland is the only cool judge...</p>
                        <p>17:25 Peter: He's the man.</p>
                        <p>17:26 Rhiannon: To have ever existed. Anyway, so Exxon appeals it again, the Ninth Circuit ordered the punitive damages to be reduced to $2.5 billion, and that's when it went to the Supreme Court. Now, just one more point, because they're so fucking evil, just to emphasize again how this rotten piece of shit, satanic corporation is absolutely evil to its core. Exxon's official position was that punitive damages against them should be no more than $25 million because it had spent an estimated $2 billion on the clean-up, but you have to know that they recovered a significant portion of the cost of clean-up and litigation through insurance claims.</p>
                        <p>18:06 Michael: Of course.</p>
                        <p>18:09 Rhiannon: And also in 1989, a few months after the accident, Exxon sued the state of Alaska, saying that the state had not given Exxon permission to use oil dispersant chemicals in the clean-up until a couple of days after the spill. So it was apparently Alaska's fault why the clean-up was bad. Alaska's response, by the way, they said that Exxon didn't need permission to use the chemicals. They were like, "I don't know why you're asking us." And in fact, Exxon didn't have enough and that's why they were blaming the delay on the state of Alaska. Also, the chemicals used in the clean-up caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system and blood disorders among the clean-up crews. I love my life, I love this case, I love the world we live in.</p>
                        <p>18:53 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>18:54 Rhiannon: Let's get back to the law.</p>
                        <p>18:55 Peter: Maybe they should have needed approval to use those chemicals, just gonna throw that out there.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:57 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:00 Peter: Alright, so that was... Wow, that's a lot. I feel like I learned a lot about Exxon. I will be getting my gas from Gulf only from now on. [laughter] Gulf, the oil supplier you can trust.</p>
                        <p>19:15 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah. You got it.</p>
                        <p>19:18 Peter: Let's lock that ad down. Let's lock it in. It's time to start bringing in the big bucks, guys.</p>
                        <p>19:21 Rhiannon: You can sleep easy tonight.</p>
                        <p>19:24 Peter: They're probably fucking owned by Exxon already.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:25 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, yeah. It's either them or BP, I'm sure.</p>
                        <p>19:29 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:30 Peter: Alright, so the first thing to note about the law here, it's not that important for understanding the case, but it is sort of fun. We're talking about maritime law...</p>
                        <p>19:39 Rhiannon: Whoop, whoop.</p>
                        <p>19:40 Peter: Which is the law that applies on the water, on the open ocean. And the reason that maritime law is like, it's a separate thing, is mostly a jurisdictional thing. Like if you're on a ship, you are not necessarily under the jurisdiction of any given state, so you need a separate set of laws and rules to govern you. And it's also this sort of historic thing that carries back from these old ancient rules and the waters around Britain and all that. It's just... Every maritime law case, even modern ones, read like they're from the 1700s. It's very bizarre. The more important thing to understand about this case is that we're talking about two types of damages: One is compensatory, which are meant to compensate someone for any damage that they actually took; the other, the one that's being contested here, is punitive damages, and those are meant to punish the wrong-doer and deter others from engaging in the same type of conduct.</p>
                        <p>20:41 Peter: So if you burn someone's house down due to your own recklessness, you could be sued for the value of the house, but they could also ask for punitive damages, basically saying you're an asshole, and there should be a punishment for being an asshole, so you have to pay this amount of money. So the Court here is holding that the punitive damage amount was excessive and that Exxon should not have to pay as much as it was ordered to pay, which at this point was $2.5 billion, down from an original jury award of $5 billion, so it's already half of what it was.</p>
                        <p>21:19 Peter: And to remind you, this money, the damages would have gone to a bunch of local Alaskans who were suing because their livelihoods were impacted by the spill. Another thing we should note before we get into this, there are a ton of different opinions in this. There's different sections of the opinion and different Justices sign to different sections of the opinion. We're gonna ignore almost all of that, just focus on what David Souter wrote and the controlling majority for the most part, and I will make one other note, which is that Justice Alito recused himself because he owned too much Exxon stock.</p>
                        <p>21:56 Rhiannon: Oh, my God. It's fucking embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>22:00 Michael: Rules. Yeah. Alright, let's go to a fucking ad. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>22:06 Peter: So getting into the opinion itself. First, Souter starts out with this unbelievably dull exploration of the origins of punitive damages in the law, and holy shit, is it boring, guys. It's just like, "In 1683, Sir Collinsworth of Yorkshire first noted the wisdom of punitive damages. In his famous letter from the Emsworth Castle... " [laughter] Oh, just shut the fuck up.</p>
                        <p>22:36 Michael: It's so fucking terrible. It has a literal reference to fucking Hammurabi's code. Punitive damages for stealing a goat from a freed man, that's in there. So we have citations to fucking Babylonia in this opinion, and as I'm reading it, I'm gearing up to be like, "Here's another case of the fucking Supreme Court just basing its decision on all this bullshit that doesn't matter because it doesn't matter," but then Souter is like, none of this matters. He literally is like, "Regardless... " That's how he fucking punctuates this whole history, "Regardless, this is the current state of the law, and this is what we're working with." And it's like, "Why the fuck are you wasting everybody's time with this discursive historical discussion?" It's meaningless.</p>
                        <p>23:29 Peter: I feel like I went on a little journey to Babylon.</p>
                        <p>23:29 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:31 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>23:32 Rhiannon: No, it's absolutely like when you needed to write a 2000-word essay and you're around 1800 words and you're just like, "Fuck, what do I... How do I... "</p>
                        <p>23:40 Michael: What's the history of punitive damages? They used to be called exemplary damages.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:45 Michael: That's also in the opinion and an explanation of why.</p>
                        <p>23:50 Peter: It's like a little trivia about punitive damages. So he makes this quick note about how punitive damages are limited to "cases of enormity where the wrong-doing is particularly severe." And he never really says it, but you can tell he's sort of hinting at the idea that this isn't one of those cases, and it's like, I do feel like that's pretty offensive, like how many fucking seals do you have to kill for it to be a case of enormity?</p>
                        <p>24:20 Michael: Yeah, and so he also points out that, "Look, punitive damages, they're more common and more generous in America than there are in other countries." And he's like, "Look, you know, in Canada, in the UK, there are these caps and some countries in Europe forbid them altogether and even will shield their native corporations from punitive damage judgments gotten against them in foreign courts." And it's like, okay, except you can't talk about foreign legal systems like that without also including all the other ways that they regulate and police corporate behavior, right?</p>
                        <p>24:56 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:58 Michael: Like torts damages, that's just one piece. There are safety regulations and government oversight, which are just all different pieces of the larger scheme that societies decide how to police corporate malfeasance, and it's not illuminating to just shear off one piece of the scheme and compare it to another. I've done business in Germany and those corporations are a lot more restrained in what they have to do, 'cause they're heavily regulated, and it might make sense in that scheme to have more limited punitive damages, but it doesn't make any sense here, where you basically have corporations who just want it both ways. They want little to no front-end government restraints, but they also want no liability on the back end either. Like that's...</p>
                        <p>25:46 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>25:48 Peter: Right. I wanna note that I've also done business in Germany, I bought hashish in Berlin in 2018. So Souter then starts talking about how research shows that punitive damages are not out of control, that they're usually pretty stable, but he says there's like a real problem, that's that they're very unpredictable, they can vary in size, they've got large standard deviations from one to the next and all that. And so he's bringing up this big concern, and this is the central premise of the entire argument he's making: "How can the people and corporations who are being sued for their reckless wrong-doing, predict the exact amount of punitive damages they might have to pay?" And the answer is, they can't. And Souter is very concerned about that.</p>
                        <p>26:39 Peter: And I think our rhetoric to that is pretty simple. Why does it matter at all? Souter says that it's important that bad actors know the stakes, so that they can properly weigh the consequences, but that's fucking batshit crazy, it's completely backwards. Allowing corporations to do the math so they can figure out exactly how much litigation will cost, so that they can do a cost benefit analysis on dumping oil on a fucking baby seal, that's not a worthy goal, that's terrible. It's a truly awful thing, and to think that it is actually the great outcome, is beyond me. I think the primary purpose of having these sorts of damage awards that are meant to punish the wrong-doer, is to deter big companies, especially, from engaging in this sort of activity, and having unpredictable damages serves as a good deterrent, they might fear that they're going to get sued for whatever environmental pollution they cause and actually get their shit together, maybe start investing in safety protocols, etcetera.</p>
                        <p>27:49 Peter: But if they know that the amount will be fairly small, they can just build that into their calculus and maybe decide that polluting or being reckless with respect to their pollution, is in fact the way to go. So in other words, Souter treats the unpredictability of punitive damages as if it's a bug, but in reality, it's a feature, it forces companies to invest in safety and public safety and public health, and it keeps them on their toes in such a way, where we don't have to worry that they are behind the scenes sort of calculating how best to fuck all of our shit up.</p>
                        <p>28:28 Rhiannon: Exactly. I think a really personally offensive part of the opinion for me is when he says that this is analogous to, in criminal law where there are minimum and maximum ranges of punishment, so people know, like it's predictable, that there's this system in place where you know the maximum amount of time, for instance, that you would serve in prison for committing a certain crime. That's so absurdly stupid that it makes me wanna die.</p>
                        <p>28:58 Peter: The maximum criminal punishment is death.</p>
                        <p>29:01 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. The maximum criminal punishment, is... Say it's even life, so it's a life sentence, there's a natural cap on it, because that's the natural end of what a person can give, you dumb ass piece of shit.</p>
                        <p>29:15 Peter: And that's not meant to give criminals the opportunity to figure out whether it's worth it.</p>
                        <p>29:19 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. The second thing is that...</p>
                        <p>29:21 Peter: That's the point.</p>
                        <p>29:22 Rhiannon: Right, the second thing is that he's counter-intuited that point, by saying corporations need to know the maximum. That... Sorry, the maximum sentence in the criminal world is that you pay the ultimate price, you give your fucking life, for something bad that you did. But here, he's flipping it to say, it should be predictable and manageable, the amount of punishment that a corporation gets, rather than saying a corporation needs to pay the ultimate price for fucking shit up.</p>
                        <p>29:54 Michael: And even citing to cases and statutes and stuff that are like punitive damages should not bankrupt corporations. That's the last thing you want with punitive damages, is to just totally... But that is the equivalent, fucking ExxonMobil, raze it to the ground, fuck 'em.</p>
                        <p>30:10 Rhiannon: Right, right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>30:12 Peter: Exactly. If you're gonna compare it to criminal law, then the same logic should apply. If you're willing to kill a human being for what they've done, in some cases, as we mentioned in our Tison v. Arizona episode, in some cases where that person didn't even kill anyone, if you're willing to do that, then surely bankrupting a company can't be a bridge too far. But, fuck it, whatever. A couple of episodes ago, we made fun a little bit of the field of law and economics, and I think that this decision is part of the rot caused by that trend in legal academia. There's an assumption built into a lot of law and economics reasoning that if someone does damage to someone else, they can just pay the monetary equivalent and all is good, and that really ignores how these things work in reality.</p>
                        <p>31:02 Peter: If someone burns down your house and then hands you the cash value of everything you lost, you're not like, "Oh, okay, never mind, we're good." The situation has not been fully addressed and, more generally, some damages are hard to quantify or hard to prove, and here we have both. Money can maybe help undo some of the damage Exxon caused, but can really fix it. How many animals were killed, how many habitats were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable for a long period of time, how many people had their livelihoods interrupted for years and years on end? You can't rely on companies who break the law simply paying out cash to fix everything. They need to be actively deterred with the prospect of big penalties.</p>
                        <p>31:48 Peter: You can't just wait for something to happen and say, "Okay, now they can pay you for whatever they did," there needs to be a way to actually prevent them from doing it in the first place. The law and economics approach, what it does is reduce human suffering and animal suffering and environmental damage to a matter of mathematics. But it's not that simple and concrete. Sometimes large wealthy corporations need to face significant consequences in situations where the damage done can't be readily repaired. And when you say the companies need to be able to easily predict how much they'd pay, you're playing into a game where they can use their resources to strategically weigh their risk and reward and avoid liability for their wrong-doing.</p>
                        <p>32:29 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>32:31 Peter: And the Court is acting like facing big penalties is like this horrible burden on these companies. And one of the big ironies here is that this oil spill happened in 1989. This case happened in 2008, so here we are, 19 years later, Exxon is still challenging their liability in court. The very existence of this case is proof that these corporations will fight tooth and nail to avoid the consequences of their actions.</p>
                        <p>33:05 Rhiannon: Absolutely. So Souter in the opinion is basically saying like, "Look, defendants shouldn't have to be worried about paying a bunch of money just because they single-handedly endangered the orca species. Instead, we're gonna create a rule. Punitive damages can't be higher than the compensatory damages in maritime cases." So Exxon had been ordered to pay about $500 million as compensation, and the $5 billion was the punitive damages portion. The Ninth Circuit cut the $5 billion in half, like we said, and the Supreme Court then reduces it by an additional 80% down to $500 million, one-tenth of what the original jury found. And this outcome and the rule that punitive damages can't be higher than the compensatory damages, that is completely arbitrary.</p>
                        <p>33:54 Rhiannon: It's literally just the Court saying, "Look, that's unfair, it's just too much money. You can't make Exxon pay that." That's it. That's the legal analysis that's behind this. We talk a lot on this podcast about how selectively the Court applies the concept of judicial restraint. Justices will say, "Look, it's not the duty of the Court to step in here," but that's just when it suits them. Here they're making a completely unfiltered judgment call that Exxon had to pay too much money in damages for a massive oil spill.</p>
                        <p>34:29 Michael: Yeah, and then as usual, we have some criticism from the liberals in dissent as well. And so Stevens, in particular, he writes this dissent and it's very focused on sort of the judicial restraint question, and it's like, "Well, look, this isn't really our job." And so he sort of talks about how maritime law is like one of the few areas where the Supreme Court actually gets to sit as a court in common law and make up the law. But it does it in sort of parallel with Congress and that Congress is legislated a lot, and this is really, should be statutory, Congress has spoken on limiting damages in some cases, and the fact that it isn't here, they should respect that and blah, blah, blah, and it's well-argued, but completely unpersuasive.</p>
                        <p>35:14 Michael: Completely absent from the entire discussion is everything we've talked about, the damage, the just utter destruction of this wildlife, this habitat, these people's livelihoods, which is like, that's the core issue. Nobody's gonna really care whether or not the Supreme Court is overstepping its bounds. What people care about is whether this monetary award is ridiculous. Is it out of step with reason, is it something that we socially think is inappropriate? And all the arguments about that are about how reckless Exxon was and how damaging this spill was, and Stevens has nothing to say about that at all. It's just so fucking weak and disconnected. Yeah, it's like ivory tower bullshit at its peak.</p>
                        <p>36:12 Peter: Yeah, right. So it's important to understand that this case fits into a broader political objective, spearheaded by Republicans to limit damages in civil cases, to limit damages in lawsuits. And they want that because their political allies, large corporations, would benefit from it. Obviously, big corporations are frequently sued, and so putting caps on damages or otherwise limiting them helps those corporations tremendously.</p>
                        <p>36:40 Michael: Right, and so a lot of this stems from a familiar refrain on this podcast, a lot of this stems from right-wing efforts to roll back legal and policy gains that the left made in the '60s and '70s, and in this area, there were a number of stuff that pissed off conservatives. Just a few examples are, this was the first time commercial actors started having affirmative duties put on them to protect consumers. This was also the time when contributory negligence was eliminated as a complete defense, so it used to be if there was a car accident and one party was 95% at fault and the other party was 5% at fault, too bad, that 5% eliminates you from claiming anything in court, and that changed.</p>
                        <p>37:27 Michael: And corporations hated this shit and so what did they do? They funneled a bunch of money into the Republican party and right-leaning think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, and you had this whole movement, Ronald Reagan campaigned on it, it was a tort reform. Torts are like that's when you just sue someone for negligence or assault or things like that. That was a big thing in '94 when the Republicans took over the House, it was part of their contract with America. They passed a big law in the '90s, and Bill Clinton vetoed it in '96 and Bob Dole ran on it in that election. Fucking Bob Dole. God.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>38:06 Michael: And so the corollary to this, of course, is that then, plaintiff's lawyers started funneling a bunch of money to Democrats and are one of the most important donor bases for Democrats, so it's like a sharply partisan, well-monied issue on both sides of the political divide. And now, this has been going on since the '80s, and you have an entire generation of politicians, policy guys, conservative lawyers and judges, who just have been immersed in this culture for their entire lives, for decades, that's what they came up in, that's all they know.</p>
                        <p>38:41 Peter: It's penetrated popular culture in a lot of ways, the idea that we are a litigious society is basically, it borders on being common sense in the view of a lot of people, and the idea that there are like people in this country are willing to sue about anything, and the hot coffee case where the lady spilled McDonald's coffee on herself and was a laughing stock of talk show hosts. Only recently has the rhetorical tide turned back, where people were like, "Actually, that woman was severely burnt." It would surprise a lot of people to know that it's not just that those things are over-simplified or wrong, they are right-wing talking points that successfully made their way into living room conversation.</p>
                        <p>39:25 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's such a good point. And it goes back to what Michael said up top, which is, this is the system that we have here, we have corporate accountability built into a system of litigation where you can sue to hold people and companies accountable. That's not a bad thing.</p>
                        <p>39:42 Michael: Right, right, that's part of the deal here. You have laissez faire economics on the front end, where you have less regulations, but on the back end, you have to pay up if you fuck up. And the McDonald's case, I didn't learn this until law school, again, taken in by the right-wing talking points that I didn't know McDonalds was purposely making the coffee insanely hot that they knew was dangerous and certainly not drinkable, because they had research saying, "Well, look, people buy it at the drive-through and they don't drink it for 10 minutes, so we need it so fucking hot, that 10 minutes later when they get to destination, it's still warm and the right drinking." So yeah, she fucking burned her skin off because they were purposely making a dangerous product.</p>
                        <p>40:26 Rhiannon: Exactly, and this wasn't ever public either, and I don't remember if this is 100% accurate, but the way they calculated damages in that case was taking the profit that McDonald's makes off of just coffee sales for one day. So just a millions of dollars total award amount seemed so crazy, but it was actually incredibly reasonable for that corporation.</p>
                        <p>40:53 Peter: Right. What this conservative movement led to, is an ideological framework that I think would sound crazy to the average person, but just about any practicing lawyer can tell you is true. Conservatives genuinely believe that the legal system is unfair, not to minorities or the poor, but to corporations and this is because corporations find themselves in litigation frequently, and litigation is very expensive. Corporations are full of guys in boardrooms who are looking at the books and they have this big fucking book of legal costs, and they're just like, "God damn, this is too much." So they lobby to keep those costs down, and the amount of times I've heard of people that work at or for businesses in the law, say that their real problem is frivolous lawsuits.</p>
                        <p>41:46 Peter: It's unbelievable, they really, truly believe it. And obviously, this ignores the reality that the legal system's reliance on money to drive litigation benefits corporations, of course, for the very simple reason that they have a lot of it, and they are absolutely crushing very meritorious claims like this one. We've got a case here, where 20 years later, the plaintiffs are trying to recover punitive damages and the Court is still fucking with it, and Exxon is still trying to do their best to fight at every single turn, and winning, because they're rich, because their interests align with the powerful people who make the decisions. This decision comes from that ideological foundation, corporations believe that their legal costs are generally excessive, so they fight them at every stage, all the way up to the Supreme Court, and they often win, because as we are wont to say on this podcast, the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>42:52 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>42:53 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>42:56 Peter: Next week, we are talking about qualified immunity, the doctrine that protects police officers and other government officials from civil liability when they are sued by people who they smack in the head with batons and so forth.</p>
                        <p>43:13 Michael: Yeah, good stuff.</p>
                        <p>43:16 Rhiannon: I don't even...</p>
                        <p>43:17 Michael: Normal policing business. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:21 Peter: Follow us on Twitter @fivefourpod, retweet our episodes, tell your friends about us, tell your parents about us, I think they'd like us.</p>

                        <p>00:07 Peter: Welcome to a bonus episode of 5-4. It's an emergency, guys. The Supreme Court just held that Title VII, the law that prohibits discrimination in employment, protects against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In other words, it's now officially illegal nationwide to discriminate against gay and trans people in employment. We thought this warranted a bonus episode. We had an episode coming out today on unrelated issues, we're pushing that back, fuck it, fuck that episode. Not important.</p>
                        <p>00:47 Rhiannon: We do what we want.</p>
                        <p>00:48 Peter: That's right. You can listen to it tomorrow, and then you should listen to another episode of ours, maybe an older one, the following day. I am Peter, Twitter's The Law Boy. I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:03 Rhiannon: Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:04 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:05 Michael: Hey, everybody. This would be a good place to insert an air horn noise or something, by the way, I just want this to feel very celebratory.</p>
                        <p>01:15 Peter: Yeah, so this is a weird bonus episode because it's good news.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Michael: Yeah. That's right.</p>
                        <p>01:19 Rhiannon: Yeah, we don't know what to do.</p>
                        <p>01:20 Peter: This is unequivocally good news, and we're not gonna pretend that it's not. I will say that it would be nice to exist in a world where a decision affirming the most obvious and basic rights of our citizens was not viewed as a towering achievement of the court.</p>
                        <p>01:34 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>01:34 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:36 Peter: But here we are. It is. One important thing to note here is that just about everyone thought this was gonna go the other way. It felt like a loss. It's interesting and good to see both Neil Gorsuch and John Roberts join the good guys. Welcome to the resistance, Neil and John. We love you, and we stand by your side.</p>
                        <p>01:56 Rhiannon: I guess we'll take your fucking crumbs.</p>
                        <p>02:00 Michael: Yeah. Speaking of crumbs, it's like, I think a good way to contextualize this decision at the top, again, it is unreservedly great. But, there was a poll last year from a reputable pollster, Quinnipiac, about whether or not employers should be able to fire people because they're gay and...</p>
                        <p>02:17 Rhiannon: Right, what did the good American people say?</p>
                        <p>02:19 Michael: 92% of the American public thought employers should not be able to do that. 98% of Democrats, 94% of Independents, and 84% of Republicans. This is about as close to a consensus opinion as you can get, and it garnered six out of nine votes.</p>
                        <p>02:37 Rhiannon: On the Supreme Court. Right?</p>
                        <p>02:41 Michael: And that felt like a huge fucking upset, 'cause if the liberals weren't on this, you would have thought it would be 5-4 max.</p>
                        <p>02:46 Peter: Yeah. There was some real discussion about whether Roberts would join the liberals on this, and it seemed like a real possibility, but getting Gorsuch and Roberts? What a win! Thank you to the Supreme Court, we're sorry about the podcast, we shouldn't have cast so many aspursions.</p>
                        <p>03:02 Rhiannon: John Roberts, sorry I said I would kick your ass.</p>
                        <p>03:06 Michael: Welcome to 2012. We're glad you are slowly catching up with the cultural milieu.</p>
                        <p>03:16 Peter: What we wanna do with this episode is explain the decision, talk about Justice Sam Alito's absolutely insane dissent for a little bit and talk about the next fronts in this war, in the war for LGBT rights in employment, but again, for now, thank you to the Supreme Court. You are our magnificent and benevolent rulers, and we bow down to your unmitigated authority.</p>
                        <p>03:43 Rhiannon: Except when you listen to our episode tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>03:46 Peter: Yeah. Alright, so the decision, Neil Gorsuch writes for the majority, the 6-3 majority, as we mentioned, joined by the liberals and John Roberts, and Neil is gonna have to pay reparations to the Federal Society after this one.</p>
                        <p>04:01 Michael: Yeah, they are...</p>
                        <p>04:01 Rhiannon: They are so mad.</p>
                        <p>04:04 Peter: Take that!</p>
                        <p>04:06 Rhiannon: They are so mad.</p>
                        <p>04:06 Peter: Conservatives on Twitter are furious, and they're not gonna be okay with Neil until they watch him do a race violence of some kind.</p>
                        <p>04:16 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah. Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:18 Peter: They need to watch him physically injure a non-white person before they're gonna be okay with him moving forward.</p>
                        <p>04:25 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:25 Peter: So, Rhi, give us some background here, what's going on with this case?</p>
                        <p>04:28 Rhiannon: Yeah, just really quick, this case, Bostock versus Clayton County, Georgia, it's actually a consolidation of three different cases that kind of came up through the federal court system at about the same time. Gerald Bostock was a long-time court employee in Clayton County, Georgia, and he was fired from his job after he joined a recreational gay softball league. Clayton County, Georgia told him that that was a behavior unbecoming of an employee, and he was fired.</p>
                        <p>04:58 Peter: Either play full speed baseball, or get out of my business, sir.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:02 Michael: It's just worth noting that this guy was an exemplary employee, right? I don't even know how you win awards as a court employee, but he did, apparently.</p>
                        <p>05:12 Rhiannon: Yeah, worked there well over a decade, I wanna say like 18 or 19 years at this point. Had a stellar job record like Michael said. The second case, Donald Zarda, he was fired from his job at a New York skydiving business called Altitude Express after they learned that he was gay, and finally, the third plaintiff, Aimee Stephens, she was terminated from her job at Harris Funeral Homes in Michigan, after she told her boss that she was gonna take vacation time during which she would undergo gender-affirming surgery. So, these three cases, like I said, they all happen sort of 2010 to 2013, and they start making their way through the court system. Eventually, they are consolidated into this one case at the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>05:57 Peter: So, the basic reasoning of the majority here is simple and compelling. Title VII is a law that bars discrimination in employment on the basis of sex. The majority says, "Look, when you discriminate against someone for being gay, you're discriminating against them based on their sex, you're expressly saying that you have problems with a man being with another guy, but you wouldn't mind if it was a woman." That's sex discrimination. The same logic applies to transgender people. So the fact that Title VII does not explicitly say that you can't discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity is irrelevant.</p>
                        <p>06:35 Michael: Right. And what Gorsuch writes, which is I think maybe the best line in the opinion, he says, "The statute's message for our cases is equally simple and momentous, an individual's homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions." It's just nice to see. It's just an unmitigated no qualifiers necessary victory for gay and trans rights.</p>
                        <p>07:02 Peter: Right, right. Another quote from the decision, I wanna highlight, "It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex." And Gorsuch highlights, I think, a very simple poignant hypothetical. "If there are two employees who are both attracted to men, and the only difference between them is that one is a man and one is a woman, and the man's fired, but the woman's not, the difference is sex," right? That's discrimination on the basis of sex. And that's expressly prohibited by Title VII.</p>
                        <p>07:36 Rhiannon: Yeah, I just wanna make a quick note too that academics have been talking about this principle in discrimination law for a few years, this idea of anti-stereotyping principle, that the basis of anti-discrimination law is that you're putting unfair stereotypes on people, like race discrimination is wrong because you're stereotyping somebody and drawing conclusions about, say, what they can do at work or whatever based on their race. The same thing with sex discrimination. I'm just pointing that out because it is interesting to me to see over the course of years the academic scholarship about this kind of stuff, and then to see it adopted by a conservative to make a majority here is really interesting. So turning to the dissent, the basic position of the dissenters is that when the law was passed in the 1960s, no one thought that they were passing a law protecting gay or trans people from discrimination, but what Gorsuch says in the majority is, "Look, that's irrelevant because this is discrimination based on sex, and that's what the statute protects against."</p>
                        <p>08:44 Peter: You have this sort of obvious point, the textualist point, if you will, which is that the statute prohibits discrimination based on sex. And this is a subset of that. This is a type of discrimination based on sex, but there's also a unanimous case from 1998 called Oncale v. Sundowner Systems. And in that case, a guy was being harassed by his co-workers, they were saying homophobic things about him, he claimed that he was not actually gay, but the court held that that's irrelevant. Title VII protected against this type of harassment because it was based on his sex. They were harassing him based on characteristics that would be in their view acceptable for a woman, but not for a man. So the same idea is being applied here 22 years later, and the big news, the big news about this case is the Sam Alito dissent, which is in total over 100 pages long.</p>
                        <p>09:42 Rhiannon: He's so fucking mad.</p>
                        <p>09:44 Michael: It's insane.</p>
                        <p>09:45 Rhiannon: He's so upset.</p>
                        <p>09:45 Peter: A huge chunk of that is dedicated to appendices, which are...</p>
                        <p>09:49 Michael: Multiple.</p>
                        <p>09:50 Peter: That's a very weird thing to have in a dissent, and as with any Alito opinion, you know you're in for a nice little trip to dipshit city. He starts it off with this, this is a quote, "There is only one word for what the court has done today, legislation."</p>
                        <p>10:10 Rhiannon: Shut the fuck up,  fool. I fucking hate him.</p>
                        <p>10:13 Peter: Okay, dude. Okay. The decision is literally interpreting the law by its words, while Alito was the one trying to read extra context into those words, Only someone like Alito could think that this is a strong rebuttal, right, someone who's so blind to his biases that he leads off with a critique that is probably much better levied at his own argument, than the majority's argument. Right? His own argument does a lot more policy-based arguing than the majority's. So for him to say that the majority is the one legislating from the bench, it borders on projection. The bulk of his argument is really one point, discrimination based on sex is not the same thing as discrimination based on sexual orientation, it's just not. He's throwing his hands in the air, you can sense his exasperation at having to confront the only very slightly nuanced argument that while these types of discrimination are not exactly the same thing, one is a subset of the other.</p>
                        <p>11:13 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>11:13 Peter: Sexual orientation discrimination or gender identity discrimination is simply a type of sex discrimination. He basically ignores that idea, sort of refusing to confront it directly, Kavanaugh also files a dissent where he refuses to confront it directly. And instead he says, "Look, no one at the time of Title VII being passed in the 1960s would have thought that they were protecting sexual orientation or gender identity." And it's like, I guess that's true to a degree, but it's not relevant because the clear language of the law protects against discrimination on the basis of sex, and that's what this is. If there are two otherwise identical employees, both attracted to men, and the only difference is that one is himself a man, then firing one, but not the other, is discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>
                        <p>12:02 Peter: That is a very simple common sense point that the dissent cannot reason its way around. Gorsuch also points out, many people at the time did think this covered sexual orientation. Lawsuits were filed to that end, and law review articles were published to that end. And laws protecting people on the basis of race were passed in the 1800s. Our conception of what exactly race is has changed over the years. At the time, phrenologists who believed that racial differences could be explained by a skull shape were like a legitimate school of thought, but we don't defer to phrenology when we're interpreting the 14th Amendment, and we shouldn't let ourselves be boxed in because some legislators in the '60s might not have understood the full implications of protecting discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>
                        <p>12:54 Peter: And more holistically, the big problem for conservatives here is that they're generally all about the statutory text, and the text here says you can't discriminate based on sex. They can't really work with that, so they have to start talking about what the legislators in the 1960s intended when passing the law. But inquiring into legislative intent is something that conservatives claim they hate to do, so to watch them lean way into it is very deeply satisfying to me.</p>
                        <p>13:24 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>13:25 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>13:25 Peter: It's hard to explain, but I have now spent a solid decade plus of my life just absorbing their bullshit about how legislative intent is like just the worst thing that you can possibly do with respect to statutory interpretation, and here they are, just claiming it as if it were a perfectly acceptable way to approach this.</p>
                        <p>13:45 Michael: Yeah, and a lot of their complaints, especially Scalia, but academics as well, it's not just like a usefulness of legislative intent, it's a formalistic one, that say, "Look, Congress didn't pass its intentions, and the president didn't sign their intentions into law. They passed a law, the law is words on paper. The president signed the law. That's what we interpret. We interpret the text. That's all were constitutionally permitted to consider."</p>
                        <p>14:16 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:16 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:17 Michael: But here, as Gorsuch is saying, it's like, "The text is the text, man. That's what they passed, that's what we have to work with." And it's driving fucking Alito off the wall. He's so upset.</p>
                        <p>14:28 Peter: Yeah, and Gorsuch does call him out in what's clearly like a little war of the conservatives where he's like, "We're actually not permitted to rely on the intent at all." And it's clearly aimed right at Alito's head. Alito doesn't really address it in any substantial way.</p>
                        <p>14:45 Michael: And Alito is like... He's so off the charts angry. There's a point deep into his 100-page opinion where he's exhausted with yelling at the majority, and he's just like, "Look, there are amicus briefs, and there were arguments raised by the parties that the court didn't adopt, and I'm just gonna fucking... I'm gonna go off on those too." Here's 15-20 pages to say why those arguments suck and why they're wrong too, and you're all fucking wrong.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:15 Michael: Just like ranty, angry. It's so ridiculous. For the sake of completeness, he says.</p>
                        <p>15:21 Peter: Right. Right, right. So yeah, we wanna address some of the wilder portions of this dissent.</p>
                        <p>15:30 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>15:31 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>15:32 Peter: He has a laundry list of problems this causes that it's literally presented in list form. One of them is that trans people might leverage this opinion to get insurance coverage for transitional surgeries from their employers. Oh my God, it's a slippery slope.</p>
                        <p>15:50 Michael: Oh no.</p>
                        <p>15:50 Rhiannon: Oh no.</p>
                        <p>15:52 Peter: First, you don't let them get discriminated against, next thing you know, they're leveraging that to get gender-affirming surgeries. It takes him about 10 pages, a little more to start talking about pronouns. Great quote here.</p>
                        <p>16:03 Rhiannon: Oh my god.</p>
                        <p>16:03 Peter: "Under established English usage, singular personal pronouns are used to refer to someone in the third person, he, him and his for males, she, her, and hers for females. His point is that this might lead to lawsuits for the improper use of pronouns, and also he appears to have forgotten about the pronouns, they and them, those rarely used pronouns.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>16:35 Michael: And there's a passage that I think gives away the game a little bit, he presents it as just giving some color about what the times were like when this law was passed, but there's an air of wistfulness about it when he talks about how, at the time this law was passed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, whatever the DSM, being gay was considered a mental disorder, sexual deviancy.</p>
                        <p>17:00 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>17:02 Michael: The plain truth is that in 1974, homosexuality was thought to be a mental disorder, and homosexual conduct was regarded as morally culpable and worthy of punishment. That's not something you write if it's not something you fucking agree with.</p>
                        <p>17:18 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>17:19 Peter: I'm reminded of times in my childhood with my father when we would roam the neighborhood, looking for men wearing shorts that were too short and would hurl rocks at their heads. I wonder now if society would reject such a practice.</p>
                        <p>17:29 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>17:30 Rhiannon: I feel sad that we're losing our most cherished tradition.</p>
                        <p>17:34 Peter: The sense of brotherhood between two men who are violently attacking a gay man. Is that now lost to history?</p>
                        <p>17:48 Michael: And for good measure, he closes with some classic conservative boogeyman, of course, you can't talk about trans rights without talking about bathrooms and sports.</p>
                        <p>18:00 Rhiannon: Yes, right.</p>
                        <p>18:01 Peter: The argument is really just like the comment section of any Breitbart article where it's like, "Look, my daughter is playing basketball, she's in third grade. What if there's a trans woman who dunks on her by the time she's 10? It will be humiliating. I can't put Samantha through that."</p>
                        <p>18:22 Michael: Right. I mean, he goes in back to back sentences, concerned about somebody who's born biologically male transitioning to female and competing against, in the women's sports, and then turns around and is concerned about people who were born biologically female who are transitioning to male also competing in female sports because they have hormones. And it's like, "So what, you just think that people transitioning or who have transitioned just can't compete in sports?"</p>
                        <p>18:47 Peter: Right, I think the bottom line for him is this is gonna really upset the division of the sexes in the Hunger Games that he has planned for all of us...</p>
                        <p>18:58 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>19:00 Peter: Starting in 2025. So he attaches to his dissent, as we mentioned, some very lengthy appendices, very weird and very rare. I don't have a ton to say about it other than the very first item is the definition of the word sex in the 1953 edition of Webster's New English dictionary. That's before Merriam got involved. This is just Webster on his own.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:28 Peter: And it's just funny because he's not even doing the textual interpretation here, but somehow he's still doing the nerdy textualist thing of doing dictionary citations.</p>
                        <p>19:38 Rhiannon: Right, can you imagine clerking for this motherfucker? Like if you're a clerk for Alito, and you put this shit opinion together, and you fucking copied and pasted from Webster's dictionary? Fuck you too.</p>
                        <p>19:49 Peter: Well, first he has to check to make sure that your hymen is intact, and then...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:00 Michael: Reading Alito's opinion, something that I think comes through is the degree to which his ideology and so much of conservative and Republican ideology today is just sort of a bundle of resentments, like cultural resentments towards out groups, different groups, people that aren't you. And in this case, the out groups are like gay people and transgender people, and it's just they're not somebody... They're not groups of people that he's concerned with, and that's what permeates the opinion more than anything, and it's that same lack of concern that he will apply to other minorities when that's what's in front of them.</p>
                        <p>20:42 Rhiannon: Right. I think that's exactly right, and it shows how conservatives will use whatever the convenient framework, whatever the convenient...</p>
                        <p>20:50 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>20:50 Rhiannon: Analytical rule is to get to their desired outcome because what the ideology is about is about resenting out-groups and resenting change and resenting progress.</p>
                        <p>21:01 Peter: So Justice Kavanaugh files his own dissent, and I really don't understand why because it's substantively the same as Alito's, from what I could tell. The only thing I'll note about his dissent is that he describes the majority's interpretation of Title VII as new and novel, but like I mentioned, it's exactly in line with Oncale v. Sundowner Systems, a case from 22 years ago, and it's an interpretation that's been around for decades, unless you're just not paying attention.</p>
                        <p>21:28 Rhiannon: Yeah, absolutely. What Kavanaugh and Alito both want in their dissents is to paint this issue not as one of statutory interpretation, but of the Supreme Court being moved by social change, which... That's for a long time been the reactionary position on the Supreme Court and on the law broadly, that it's overly susceptible to the tides of social progress, and the only problem is that this is just not a case where that critique really applies. What this case is, is the court's recognition that if we are to read the literal meaning of the words in Title VII, its prohibition on sex discrimination implicitly forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and Alito and Kavanaugh think they're engaging in the culture war, but they're really completely shadowboxing.</p>
                        <p>22:17 Michael: Yeah. That's right.</p>
                        <p>22:19 Peter: We should talk as we wrap up about what this means for the future of this type of litigation, these type of claims. I think there's no way around the fact that this significantly empowers LGBT people to bring discrimination claims. I've seen some people online show concern that this is going to lead to employers using pre-textual reasons to discriminate against them, which is true, but it's also true of any discrimination claim.</p>
                        <p>22:44 Rhiannon: Yeah. Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>22:45 Peter: And the only thing that can really upset this sort of state of affairs is an end to at-will employment, which I don't think we're anywhere close to in the United States. So I think for now, the expansion of Title VII to include as many categories of people as possible is really one of our best hopes on that front.</p>
                        <p>23:05 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>23:07 Peter: In terms of what the battle looks like moving forward, I think it's RFRA, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which we mentioned in Hobby Lobby, our Hobby Lobby episode. RFRA is a statute that protects the religious expression of citizens and may override conflicting statutes. Therefore, a so-called religious company might claim that they need to be able to discriminate against gay people as a matter of religious expression, and the court hasn't confronted that specific issue yet. It feels to me like this is where the argument is going. Gorsuch carves it out. He basically says, "By the way, this doesn't really address the RFRA issue." Sort of leaving some room for some finagling. I guess if I had to be a doomsayer, and we are sort of doomsayers on this podcast, it feels like a good little Roberts two step. You give them the Title VII win, and then you completely hollow it out by creating a huge exception through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which basically allows any company to say, "Well, look, I know that you said we can't discriminate against LGBT people, but it's different because we're religious," and just see where that gets them, and to be clear, I don't think that there are any companies trying to do this on non-religious grounds. Religion is the reason you do it. Religion is the reason you discriminate against LGBT people.</p>
                        <p>24:24 Michael: Well, bigotry's the reason. Religion is the reference there.</p>
                        <p>24:28 Peter: Yeah, that's fair enough.</p>
                        <p>24:29 Rhiannon: Bringing it back to the people who were involved in these cases, wanna note before we leave that plaintiff Aimee Stephens actually passed away just over a month ago in hospice care, and so just wanna say thank you, Aimee. You deserved a much better world while you were here. It's a little bit better now because of you and hope you rest in peace.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>24:53 Peter: So we're dropping another episode tomorrow. Fuck it. We do whatever we want on this podcast, okay? You thought we were once a week. Sometimes we go two. It is now 7:30 PM. Our producer is gonna turn this around, then by morning, you'll be listening to it.</p>
                        <p>25:14 Michael: 5-4 is presented by Westwood One and Prologue Projects. This episode was produced by Katya Kumkova with editorial oversight by Leon Neyfakh and Andrew Parsons. Our artwork is by Teddy Blanks at CHIPS NY, and our theme song is by Spatial Relations.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: The second opinion addresses two cases, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc, Number 13-354 and Conestoga Wood Specialties...</p>
                        <p>00:13 Leon Neyfakh: Hey, everyone. This is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about religious freedom. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that for-profit corporations may be exempt from laws and regulations they object to on religious grounds.</p>
                        <p>00:35 [Archival]: The ruling came just a short time ago. The arts and crafts retail chain will not be forced to pay to cover certain forms of contraceptives for their employees.</p>
                        <p>00:43 [Archival]: Issues combining abortion, religious liberty, ObamaCare, corporate rights all into this one ruling. And today, we heard the ruling from the five conservative justices ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby.</p>
                        <p>00:56 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:06 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have undermined America's integrity like water seeping into our homes' foundation [laughter] I am Peter. Twitter is The Law Boy. I'm here with Rhiannon...</p>
                        <p>01:20 Rhiannon: What up. Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:21 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:22 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:24 Peter: Today, we're talking about Burwell v. Hobby Lobby stores, aka Hobby Lobby, as it is better known.</p>
                        <p>01:32 Rhiannon: Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby.</p>
                        <p>01:35 Peter: Alright, let's...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:37 Peter: Let's not lose control.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:40 Rhiannon: I told you guys this, right? That I cannot stop singing that in my head. It's a Hurricane Chris song about Halle Berry.</p>
                        <p>01:47 Michael: Oh yeah, you did.</p>
                        <p>01:48 Peter: Oh, you did. You told us that like months ago...</p>
                        <p>01:51 Michael: I was gonna say weeks ago. It's been a while.</p>
                        <p>01:55 Rhiannon: Okay. Go on.</p>
                        <p>01:56 Peter: In our Citizens United episode, we discuss the inherent absurdity of corporations having the right to political speech. Hobby Lobby takes that issue, digs a little deeper and asks us, "Can a for-profit corporation have a religion? Can a company that sells arts and craft supplies sincerely believe that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ prohibits ladies from using contraception?" And the answer is yes.</p>
                        <p>02:21 Rhiannon: Of course it is.</p>
                        <p>02:23 Peter: Of course it can.</p>
                        <p>02:25 Michael: What else could it be?</p>
                        <p>02:27 Peter: This actually isn't a First Amendment case. This is a case about two laws. The Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, requires employers to cover certain basic contraception in their employer-provided healthcare plans, but Hobby Lobby argues that this violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, better known as RFRA, which requires that laws accommodate the exercise of religious beliefs. They are religiously opposed to contraception, and so they claim they shouldn't have to provide it. The real bottom line of this case is that the court has endorsed a theory of corporations, whereby these legal entities, which are basically just stacks of paperwork, can have their own beliefs, and that has led us down this path of increasing absurdity where corporations now not only hold political positions, but also have thoughts about the afterlife.</p>
                        <p>03:21 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>03:22 Peter: And this is in our first case where the majority is written by Sam Alito, but it is the prototypical Alito case, just like Roberts is at his best when he's feigning even-handedness, and Thomas is at his best when he's questioning century-old lines of precedent, Alito is at his best writing middling, incoherent opinions in defense of the most abstruse components of the Christian faith.</p>
                        <p>03:49 Rhiannon: That's right. I think a good sign of how absolutely stupid Justice Alito is is that I constantly get him confused... I get three people confused for one person. It's Sam Alito, Ted Cruz...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:08 Rhiannon: And the Attorney General under George W. Bush, what was his name?</p>
                        <p>04:13 Michael: Alberto Gonzales.</p>
                        <p>04:15 Rhiannon: Alberto Gonzales! I can't fucking tell those three people apart, and that's, I think, all you need to know about Justice Alito.</p>
                        <p>04:22 Michael: Honestly, they are intellectually indistinguishable, as far as I can tell.</p>
                        <p>04:27 Rhiannon: Right! That's what I mean! It's all the same... All the same bullshit.</p>
                        <p>04:32 Peter: Right. So I think we have to go through some of the history here of how the Religious Freedom Restoration Act came to be. So, Rhiannon, tell us about what the early 90s were like.</p>
                        <p>04:44 Rhiannon: Yeah. Okay. Alright, so just talking about RFRA, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, just wanna say up top, I don't think I read Hobby Lobby in law school, and it feels like a really complicated case. And I realized when prepping for this episode that it's because I don't really understand RFRA, because it's fucking stupid. I hate it. I don't understand it. It's really dumb. But you guys helped me, I appreciate that.</p>
                        <p>05:13 Michael: You're welcome.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:15 Rhiannon: Okay. So, basically the constitution, right, we have it, it protects the free exercise of religion.</p>
                        <p>05:22 Peter: Alright, we're doing great.</p>
                        <p>05:23 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:23 Rhiannon: Cool. That's in The First Amendment, or whatever. You can look it up, bitches.</p>
                        <p>05:28 Michael: So far, so good.</p>
                        <p>05:29 Rhiannon: Yeah. Okay, but in the late 80s, the Supreme Court started to sort of clarify that laws that only incidentally burden or infringe on religious activity, those laws don't violate The First Amendment or the Constitution, as long as those laws are generally applicable to all citizens. So, for example, there was a case where the State of Oregon denied unemployment benefits to a person who was fired for using peyote, which was an illegal substance used in that person's religious ceremonies. And the Supreme Court in that case said, in fact, it was Justice Scalia, writing for the majority... The Supreme Court said, "This law doesn't violate the free exercise clause of The First Amendment," and it would kind of be crazy if we said it did, because we can't just allow every individual to use religion as an excuse to get around following laws that are neutral and generally applicable to everybody. The law, in that case, the Supreme Court said it's not aimed at religious activity, it's just a law banning an illegal substance for everybody. And Scalia quoted some old language about not allowing each person's religious beliefs to be superior to the law of the land, and this idea that we can't let each man become a law unto himself.</p>
                        <p>06:45 Peter: I think it was very much common sense at the time, that the purpose of The First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause was to prevent Congress from giving preferential treatment to one religion or another, or discriminating against one religion over another, rather than to be some sort of blanket protection upon religious practice.</p>
                        <p>07:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, I think that's right. But after that opinion is issued, lots of people are super big mad. So a bunch of groups get together, including the ACLU, the National Association of Evangelicals, which I think there's a whole podcast episode, maybe not this podcast, that's like a critique of the ACLU, and what it means if the ACLU is partnering with the National Association of Evangelicals, but whatever.</p>
                        <p>07:33 Peter: It was a different time.</p>
                        <p>07:35 Rhiannon: Liberals, am I right? Okay, anyways. So, a bunch of groups get together, they're screaming about religious freedom, saying the government shouldn't be able to substantially burden an individual's free exercise of their faith in this way. And so, as a direct response, Congress passes RFRA in 1993. So what RFRA says is that the government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if the government demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. In other words, if someone's exercise of religion is substantially burdened by a law, the government has to show that it has a really good reason for that law and that it used the least burdensome method it possibly could. So, for example, there was a case that came up under RFRA called Gonzales versus O Centro, and in that case, the Supreme Court said that members of a church could not be prosecuted after the Feds seized a sacramental tea that contained a Schedule I illegal substance. And in that case, the court said that the government didn't have a compelling interest, they hadn't shown a good enough reason for banning that specific drug, and so it failed under RFRA.</p>
                        <p>08:53 Peter: These are my kinds of religions, by the way...</p>
                        <p>08:55 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>08:55 Peter: Sacramental tea with Schedule I drugs in it. I can get behind this.</p>
                        <p>09:00 Michael: Yeah, I'm finding religion as this podcast goes along.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>09:06 Michael: I just wanna note really quickly that there's some debate in this case between the majority and the dissent, and I think Ginsburg and dissent gets the better of it, which is that this law, the way we're describing it might sound very sort of expansive, but it's about establishing what the status quo was before this peyote case. There was a line of cases that had used, basically, this test in the legislative history, and the language of the law itself references those cases, and it's supposed to be like a pretty low key, we're just going back to how things were, the same protections as they are, but as we'll discuss, the majority instead uses that language to fucking drive a truck through this tiny little pinhole exception. So...</p>
                        <p>09:53 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's a good point. Yup. So we get RFRA in 1993, and then, like Peter said up top, the Affordable Care Act is passed in 2010. And one result of ObamaCare is that all 20 contraceptive methods approved by the FDA are now fully covered by most employer-based healthcare plans. Now, Hobby Lobby, how do they get involved? Hobby Lobby is, of course, big arts and crafts store, they have hundreds of locations across the country, and they employ almost 30,000 people. Their founder...</p>
                        <p>10:27 Peter: And they have a great name.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:31 Peter: What do we do? We're like hobby stuff. And it's... You know when you enter a building, that room's called the lobby, let's put those two together. That's our store. Bang. You're a billionaire.</p>
                        <p>10:45 Rhiannon: Boom.</p>
                        <p>10:46 Michael: I thought they were like...</p>
                        <p>10:47 Rhiannon: That's all it takes in America, baby.</p>
                        <p>10:48 Michael: I thought they were like, they lobby...</p>
                        <p>10:49 Peter: Lobby for hobbies?</p>
                        <p>10:51 Michael: For hobbies.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:52 Michael: It's the Hobby Lobby.</p>
                        <p>10:54 Peter: I'll tell you what...</p>
                        <p>10:56 Michael: Everybody should get a hobby.</p>
                        <p>10:57 Peter: That makes more sense, and yet I think it's less likely.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:02 Michael: It's definitely the big foyer name.</p>
                        <p>11:05 Rhiannon: Once we get into who these guys are, yeah, it's not that smart, not that bright. Okay. So their founder is CEO, David Green. He fancies himself a devoted Evangelical Christian. Hobby Lobby's website says that they are, quote, "Honoring the Lord in all we do by operating the company in a manner consistent with biblical principles." I don't know, it might be just Texas, but growing up, this language is particularly triggering to me. I don't know about you guys. Got some trauma there.</p>
                        <p>11:41 Peter: I just love it that any shitty company... These people just fucking mass purchase pipe cleaner and then resell it to elementary school students, and they're like, "And we're doing it for Jesus! [laughter] Put that on the website!"</p>
                        <p>11:57 Rhiannon: Yeah. So, after ObamaCare has passed, Hobby Lobby files this lawsuit, and specifically, they're objecting to the provision that coverage for contraception includes the morning-after pill and IUDs. They say, in a statement, that, quote, "The Green family's religious beliefs forbid them from participating in, providing access to, paying for, training others to engage in, or otherwise supporting abortion-causing drugs and devices." We'll just set that aside. That's fine. No comment necessary right now.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:37 Peter: Abortion-causing drugs.</p>
                        <p>12:39 Rhiannon: Right, it's...</p>
                        <p>12:40 Peter: Sorry, I know you wanted to set it aside, but it's just worth saying twice.</p>
                        <p>12:43 Rhiannon: No, no, yeah. It's that absurd. Yeah. An important side note, I think about what happens when religious fundamentalists get rich and all the more reason to object to like whatever supposed moral or religious high ground they're trying to take. In this case, Hobby Lobby has had some other legal trouble in the past decade or so, and this other trouble is related to smuggling ancient artifacts out of Iraq and spending millions of dollars on the international artifact black market.</p>
                        <p>13:15 Michael: It's so insane. It's so nuts.</p>
                        <p>13:18 Rhiannon: It's wild how stupid they are and yet how rich.</p>
                        <p>13:22 Peter: They have a museum, right? Like a Bible museum.</p>
                        <p>13:24 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>13:24 Peter: And they're just... They're funneling the artifacts into there.</p>
                        <p>13:28 Rhiannon: Yup. Yup. Yes. So, in 2010, the company gets the attention of federal law enforcement officials because they spent $1.6 million on Iraqi artifacts from dealers in the United Arab Emirates, and even though lawyers and artifact experts are voicing strong concerns, Hobby Lobby goes forward with it anyways. And in 2017, after ICE does an investigation and seizes a bunch of their shit, Hobby Lobby agrees to return more than 5500 artifacts and pay a fine of $3 million.</p>
                        <p>14:04 Michael: Can I cut in really quick?</p>
                        <p>14:05 Rhiannon: Please.</p>
                        <p>14:06 Michael: The fact that it's coming from dealers in the UAE, it's just not like a random note. The UAE is like a fucking money laundering hotspot. There are all these general trading companies that are just fronts for the Iranian National Guard, or the government of Iran, or various terrorist organizations, etcetera, etcetera. And they are max three degrees of separation from like Al-Qaeda.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>14:34 Peter: Yes, 100%.</p>
                        <p>14:34 Michael: They're like directly terrorists through...</p>
                        <p>14:36 Rhiannon: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>14:36 Michael: Like terrorist organizations, money launderers in Dubai. That's what this is.</p>
                        <p>14:42 Peter: Yeah. And another side note, I know times are tough, so if you got something that looks like maybe a biblical artifact and you wanna hawk that to someone for a quick buck, call up Hobby Lobby.</p>
                        <p>14:53 Rhiannon: Hobby Lobby's looking. [chuckle] For sure they're interested.</p>
                        <p>14:53 Peter: Walk right up to the receptionist. [laughter] She'll give you a fucking briefcase.</p>
                        <p>14:57 Rhiannon: She'll give you $500,000, sight unseen. Yeah. Okay. So, simultaneously, while the ICE investigation is going on, reports start popping up that the artifacts at the Museum of the Bible, which Peter mentioned, it's this museum that the Green family founded and runs, so reports start popping up that artifacts there are stolen or they're just completely fake. A couple of months ago, actually, it's revealed that all 16 fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls that are on display at the Museum of the Bible...</p>
                        <p>15:30 Peter: They weren't real?</p>
                        <p>15:32 Rhiannon: They're all counterfeit.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:33 Michael: What?</p>
                        <p>15:33 Peter: Fuck.</p>
                        <p>15:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, they're just made of modern ink on leather.</p>
                        <p>15:39 Peter: Did part of our background research into this find out what admission into the museum is? What does that cost?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:44 Rhiannon: That's a really good question.</p>
                        <p>15:44 Michael: I just wanna know if there's some line like, and it's not even a convincing fake, like it's got... Real amateur.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:52 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah. Egyptology experts also alleged that 11 ancient Bible fragments purchased by the Green family were purchased illegally and smuggled into the United States. And so Steve Green, David Green's son, he's the board chairman of the museum, he announced this year that the museum will be returning more than 11,000 artifacts to Egypt and Iraq. And here's this...</p>
                        <p>16:16 Peter: 11,000.</p>
                        <p>16:18 Rhiannon: 11,000. Yes. This expert in ancient artifacts at Manchester University, he said recently that the Green family, quote, "Poured millions on the legal and illegal antiquities market without having a clue about the history, the material features, cultural value, fragilities and problems of these objects."</p>
                        <p>16:39 Peter: He also said, "I don't understand. Is it a lobby where hobbies occur?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>16:46 Peter: All of this to say is, we're gonna walk through this and be talking about like these people's religious beliefs and sort of assuming that they have some level of sincerity to them, or whatever, but these people are deeply, to their core, some of the dumbest people on the planet. It's important to keep it in mind.</p>
                        <p>17:08 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>17:08 Rhiannon: That's right. Too dumb, too rich.</p>
                        <p>17:08 Peter: That's right. So, as we've mentioned, the claim here is that the requirement of the ACA that employers provide insurance for contraception is a violation of RFRA, and one important aspect of this is that RFRA doesn't forbid laws from imposing on people's religious beliefs. As Rhi mentioned, what it does is subject those laws to strict scrutiny, meaning they must be serving a compelling purpose and must be the least restrictive means of achieving that purpose. And we've talked about strict scrutiny before. And just like in those cases here, you don't really need to know the details. The real point is that the ACA has an exception for religious institutions, such as churches and other religious non-profits, and they don't have to provide coverage for contraception under the ACA. And what the court says here is Hobby Lobby should be able to opt out too, 'cause they're a religious company. And similar to Citizens United, our second episode, the fundamental problem here, in my view, is this: Ruling that corporate entities somehow hold religious beliefs or the same religious beliefs as the people who run them allows corporations to have it both ways. First, they get to take advantage of the corporate form by creating a corporation that they can hide behind to limit their liability in the event they get sued or go bankrupt or whatever...</p>
                        <p>18:33 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:33 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:34 Peter: So they're benefiting, in that case, from the separation of them as individuals and the corporation as an entity, but then, when it suits them, that separateness goes away, and suddenly their personal beliefs about religion are shared by the corporation itself. And, again, as we discussed in the Citizens United episode, the entire purpose of the corporation as a concept is to separate, for legal purposes, the owners and the entity. So this is flipping that on its head.</p>
                        <p>19:02 Michael: Right, and rather than recognize and trying to work around the absurdity of all this, the majority actually leans into it. They say, "Look, it's unfair that we're forcing people to choose between their religious beliefs and forming a corporation." But that's not unfair. That's the natural result of being able to insulate yourself from liability, by operating through a non-sentient entity. That's the definition of fairness.</p>
                        <p>19:30 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:31 Peter: Yeah, it's a trade-off, right? That's the whole point of it.</p>
                        <p>19:34 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:35 Peter: And it brings up a sort of interesting side point, which is that if Hobby Lobby's owners were really dedicated to their religion, they could employ all of their employees directly, right? You don't need to form a corporation at all. Nothing is stopping them from just striking up contracts between them personally and their employees, which would give them a much stronger religious objection here, because there wouldn't be a corporate entity in the way. But of course they don't do that. They wouldn't allow themselves to be exposed to that level of liability, right? That's why they formed a corporation, they want to take advantage of the corporate form. It's a trade-off that they chose to make, and what Alito is doing here is saying that they shouldn't even have to make that trade-off.</p>
                        <p>20:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, I have a question. Is the Green family... Are they billionaires for real?</p>
                        <p>20:17 Peter: I think in the aggregate, they are, but hold on, let me look them up, David Green.</p>
                        <p>20:21 Michael: The majority opinion seems to suggest it.</p>
                        <p>20:23 Peter: David Green is worth $7 billion.</p>
                        <p>20:26 Michael: Yeah, seven billion.</p>
                        <p>20:27 Rhiannon: From my research, it's Hobby Lobby. He's the son of a pastor, they were not rich. He's self-made with Hobby Lobby.</p>
                        <p>20:35 Michael: I don't think we've really mentioned it in here, but the majority spends two to three pages just talking about the owners and the families of these companies, which is just such schmaltzy bullshit.</p>
                        <p>20:46 Rhiannon: It's gross. Yeah, it's fucking disgusting.</p>
                        <p>20:49 Michael: Just like, oh, how they came from nothing and its family-run...</p>
                        <p>20:50 Rhiannon: Like fawning.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Michael: The son is the CEO and the other son is the Vice CEO, and blah blah blah. It's like when the law is shit, they will lead with facts that they think shade the opinion in a way that frames it favorably for them, but there's almost no discussion at all of like women, the benefits of contraception for them, the burdens of not getting it through their employer insurance will be... That's completely omitted. Instead, all the facts are about these families and their sincerely-held beliefs, and all that.</p>
                        <p>21:22 Rhiannon: So, yeah, a big part of what the court really leans on here is that everyone admits that the law covers religious, non-profit corporations. So Justice Alito says then it must cover for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby also.</p>
                        <p>21:39 Michael: That makes sense.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>21:43 Peter: I mean, look, pretending that religious non-profits, and when I say religious non-profits, I mean actual churches, that's what they tend to be, are comparable to Hobby Lobby here is insane. The court says, "Well, look, religious non-profits are still corporations and it applies to them, so it must apply to Hobby Lobby too." And first of all, you don't need to see that ground. I think there's a real argument that any type of corporation should be forbidden from claiming that it has religious status, and that possibly religious organizations should have a different type of entity altogether. But the difference is that religious non-profits are created for the literal purpose of expressing their religion, that's the whole point of making one, that's why they do it. Whereas, with for-profit corporations, the expression of religion is incidental, and that's a line worth drawing, I think. It's not abstract. It's not confusing. It's a clear difference between these types of corporate entities.</p>
                        <p>22:39 Michael: Wait, then what... Sorry. If religion is incidental, then what is the animating purpose of a for-profit corporation?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:49 Peter: Alito mentions that companies like Hobby Lobby mention in their paperwork that part of their mission is to like...</p>
                        <p>22:57 Michael: Make money for Jesus.</p>
                        <p>23:00 Peter: Spread the gospel of Jesus, and it's like... But again, that seems like maybe a sideshow, where it's just like you could start a corporation and say that you... Yeah, what's my mission? It's profit and making beautiful music. That's what I do. And then, now all of a sudden, the court has to respect that, as if that's your primary purpose.</p>
                        <p>23:22 Michael: Look, man, David Green is worth $7 billion. I don't think spreading that money to religious organizations could be plausibly said to be a substantial motivation, if he's holding on to seven billion on his own.</p>
                        <p>23:38 Peter: If you've got seven billion, you're like, "I'm doing this for Jesus, baby."</p>
                        <p>23:42 Michael: Buying an island in the Caribbean for Jesus.</p>
                        <p>23:46 Rhiannon: And Ginsburg... Ruth Bader Ginsburg writes a dissent, and in that dissent, she basically mentions that neither The First Amendment case law, which is the foundation here, nor RFRA itself, make it clear that a for-profit corporation would be protected, which is essentially to say that the idea that the law would cover these corporations, that's totally made up by the court, in this case.</p>
                        <p>24:13 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:14 Peter: Right. And so, one note here that we wanna quickly mention is that the court says that, "Look, this only applies to closely-held corporations," which are corporations that are not publicly-traded. Closely-held corporations choose who they can sell stock too, and so the court is sort of implying here that they should be given more leeway about their religion, but absolutely nothing in the court's reasoning would stop them from extending the rule to public companies. Alito explicitly says that RFRA covers for-profit corporations, and he doesn't provide any reasoning that would rule out publicly-traded corporations. And I only bring this up to note that the reason that it's limited to closely-held corporations, and you'll often hear professors and scholars talk about this case as if it is limited to closely-held corporations, the only reason they do that is to obscure the actual breadth of the ruling and pretend that it's bound by some limiting principle, when in reality, it's not.</p>
                        <p>25:07 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:08 Michael: Right. And at one point, Alito waves off these concerns and he says, "Look, publicly-traded companies would have difficulty bringing RFRA claims, because," and I quote, "The idea that unrelated shareholders, including institutional investors with their own set of stakeholders, would agree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems improbable." Now, if that language sounds persuasive and familiar, it might be because you remember us saying that in Citizens United, about the idea that publicly-traded corporations could have a shared political belief. But that was the reasoning that that entire case fucking rested on. That was the entire basis of that case, was precisely that. And so...</p>
                        <p>25:53 Peter: And Kennedy, in that case, explicitly was like, "Hey, look, if you don't like what your corporation stands for, you can sell your stock."</p>
                        <p>26:00 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>26:01 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>26:02 Michael: And I'm not saying, "Oh, they were full of shit then, but Alito is sincere now." They're full of shit in both instances. They don't care. It's not about whether this is right or wrong, and this time, they're owning up to the truth. It's whatever rhetorically serves their ideological purpose is the position they'll adopt, and it doesn't matter what lies beneath that at all.</p>
                        <p>26:26 Rhiannon: Full of shit, 24/7.</p>
                        <p>26:27 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>26:28 Peter: Yeah, absolutely. Alright. And now, we get to the meat of this, because even if you accept that Hobby Lobby is a religious corporate entity, protected by RFRA, the question is whether the requirement that they provide contraceptive insurance to their employees is a, quote, "Substantial burden on their exercise of religion."</p>
                        <p>26:52 Rhiannon: Right, and when talking about the burden, the court talks about the fines under the law if they continue to violate it, which are, in fact, substantial, so they're facing... I think it's $100 a day, per person, is the fine that's built into the law. But that's not what the analysis should be. The analysis should be whether complying with the law burdens Hobby Lobby, and the court really doesn't address that at all, which is completely nuts because it's the central question of the entire case.</p>
                        <p>27:22 Peter: Yeah, when I read it, I almost said I was misunderstanding the analysis. It's like, "Why are we talking about the fines if they don't comply?" The question is compliance, and what the burden imposed by compliance is, but they dodge it for a reason. So, Hobby Lobby says that they're opposed to contraception. Okay. The law doesn't require that they use it, it doesn't require that they provide it, it doesn't require that they purchase it. What it requires is that they provide funds into a healthcare plan, that, among many, many other things, covers contraception. That's not a substantial burden on their exercise of religion. There are at least three independent parties, the insurers, the employees and the physicians, standing between Hobby Lobby and the actual use of contraception. If that's a substantial burden on Hobby Lobby's exercise of religion, then the word substantial is meaningless, I think. How much more attenuated could their connection to the actual use of contraception really be here? Does anyone actually believe that providing employees with insurance equates to a moral endorsement of whatever they choose to use it for?</p>
                        <p>28:34 Rhiannon: Right. Right. And this is basically... It's just Hobby Lobby saying that it burdens their religion to know that their employees are using their wages from Hobby Lobby, for things Hobby Lobby disagrees with. And there's a real looming threat here that employers could say, "Look, it's infringing our religious expression when our employees use their wages for reproductive health services." And that might seem far-fetched, but there's really very little distance between that logic and the logic of the decision here. The absurdity of the opinion, in this part of the opinion, is really highlighted if you just thought about a corporation whose owners are Muslim, doing the same thing, what the outrage would be, what the reaction would be. And you kind of see that this is really about religious supremacy, this is really about Christian supremacy, right?</p>
                        <p>29:27 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:27 Peter: Absolutely. Look, if everyone in the country freaked out when they tried to build a mosque within a mile of Ground Zero.</p>
                        <p>29:34 Michael: Right, they said on Ground Zero, but it was blocks and blocks away.</p>
                        <p>29:38 Peter: It was in New York City [laughter] If you imagine that there were Muslim owners of this company or a similar company that said they didn't wanna pay... Rhi, I was posing this to you. I was like, "What if these people were Muslim?" And you were like, "Well, they don't oppose contraception."</p>
                        <p>29:54 Rhiannon: Yeah, not at all. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:57 Peter: It's a better religion. What can we say? [laughter] But they oppose life insurance, and you can see the same thing coming up, and there's no fucking way it gets five votes on a Supreme Court, no fucking way.</p>
                        <p>30:08 Rhiannon: Absolutely not.</p>
                        <p>30:09 Peter: In our Trump v. Hawaii episode, we talked about how dismissive the court was of Trump's obvious discriminatory animus toward Muslims. And that's why it's almost disingenuous or misleading to talk about freedom of religion under the Constitution, as if it's like this universal concept. Here, the court is treating something almost imperceptible, as if it is an unacceptable burden on the religion of Hobby Lobby. And that's because we're not just talking about religion, we're talking about the court's favorite religion. And every Conservative on this court is a practicing Christian, they're all Catholics, except for Gorsuch, who is an Episcopalian. Same fucking thing, I'm gonna say it.</p>
                        <p>30:56 Rhiannon: Yeah, diet Catholic.</p>
                        <p>30:58 Peter: Same fucking thing.</p>
                        <p>31:00 Michael: I have no idea.</p>
                        <p>31:01 Peter: Well, to be clear, he was raised Catholic and is now an Episcopalian. I will say, in Gorsuch's defense, I came across some articles saying that the pastor, or whatever it is at the Episcopalian church he was at, was too liberal, that was an issue for Conservatives during his confirmation. Look, if you don't think that some fucking freak like Alito is biased towards his own religion, you're out of your minds. His opinions drip with it. He has openly spoken to religious legal groups about his desire to expand the definition of religious freedom, and all of his opinions need to be read with that in mind.</p>
                        <p>31:39 Michael: Right, there's an interesting thing sometimes I think about, which is why certain Justices get certain opinions, and the way they're assigned is, if the Chief Justice is the majority, he picks who writes it, and if he's not, then the most senior judge, who's been on the court the longest, chooses who writes it. And here, it was actually... Everybody thought Roberts had this opinion. There were only two left in the term, when this was coming down. It came down on the last day. It was like Alito needed one, and then it was kind of like anybody could take it, and everybody was like, "That's a big fucking high-profile case, this is Roberts all the way." And he gave it to fucking Alito. It's like, "Why? Why does the intellectual lightweight of the court, the weakest writer in the Conservatives, why is he getting this high-profile case?" And maybe it's that this is an ideological goal, but I kind of think the answer is just that, look, they know this is shit. They know that they have to rest this entire opinion on some technical bullshit, and hide from inconvenient facts, and hide from inconvenient law, and Alito is the... He's the fucking hatchet man.</p>
                        <p>32:49 Michael: He's the right wing hack who will come do the dirty work of writing the crap opinion, where they're just making shit up and talking about legislative purpose, which the Conservatives usually hate, and talking about policy considerations, which the Conservatives usually hate. And just doing the shit that Roberts and Scalia and all them feel like they're above, which is the more blatant, overt, partisan decisions.</p>
                        <p>33:17 Rhiannon: Yeah. Michael, please use the past tense when you're discussing Scalia...</p>
                        <p>33:23 Michael: That's right. That's right.</p>
                        <p>33:25 Rhiannon: 'Cause he's fucking dead.</p>
                        <p>33:28 Peter: Deceased. Parenthesis, deceased.</p>
                        <p>33:32 Michael: In other way, in addition to what we've discussed, that Alito makes a mess of this shit, is that the supposed burden on Hobby Lobby needs to be weighed against the burden on the employee to want access to contraception, and that's just like even the court concedes at that one point in the opinion, but they barely address it.</p>
                        <p>33:54 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:54 Michael: You use a few little rhetorical tricks to do this. One thing is that the court doesn't actually decide what the exemption here that Hobby Lobby is asking for will look like. It just remands to the lower courts to sort of figure out the details. But that means that the burdens this will create on Hobby Lobby's employees and the other plaintiffs' employees, we can't say with specificity what those are, because one plaintiff suggested that, "Look, if our employees buy contraception with their own money and get a tax credit, that's fine." But that burden would be having to pay out-of-pocket upfront cost, which is a serious obstacle, like an IUD costs like a month of minimum wage. Another proposed solution involved employees having to learn that they could get this free contraceptive coverage on their own and go talk to the insurer on their own and be like the total instigator. And these are the things that will essentially make it almost certain that a substantial number of the employees simply just would not get coverage that they otherwise would be entitled to, right?</p>
                        <p>35:02 Rhiannon: Absolutely, yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:03 Michael: And the court just sort of dodges discussing that at all. And it's not just the burdens that they dodge, they also dodge the benefits that contraception provides women, which is, like we mentioned briefly that, under RFRA, the government has these laws that impinge on the exercise of religion. They need to justify it with a compelling interest. And what the court says here is, "Look, we'll just assume, for the sake of argument, that guaranteeing access to contraception is a compelling interest." But what that lets them do is just avoid talking about the way contraception reduces unwanted pregnancies, the fact that it can treat all sorts of other medical conditions, the fact that there's dangerous pregnancies that's very important for the health of women, that it's been shown to improve the socioeconomic status of women.</p>
                        <p>35:52 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:53 Peter: And it leaves the door open in the future, right?</p>
                        <p>35:55 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:55 Peter: So they say like, "Look, we're gonna assume that the provision of contraception is a compelling government interest," and then move on from there. But what that does is allow them, in the future, to say that it's not a compelling government interest. They can say, "Look, yeah, in the Hobby Lobby case, we assumed it was true, but here we have to examine it, and it turns out it's not."</p>
                        <p>36:14 Michael: Right. And at the end of the day, what this does, by sort of aligning both the way this burdens women and the ways in which contraception benefits women, this opinion, which is about women's access to contraception, omits consideration of women entirely.</p>
                        <p>36:30 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>36:31 Michael: It's just profoundly sexist. It's hard to overstate.</p>
                        <p>36:34 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:35 Peter: It really is, yeah. And that, I think, goes to the real objective of Hobby Lobby, the company here, and the reactionary movement, which is not to exercise its religion freely, but to ensure that access to contraception is as onerous for women as possible.</p>
                        <p>36:52 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>36:52 Peter: And if you think that's an exaggeration of their goals here, know this, the solution that the courts came up with, ultimately, here, was to grant for-profit companies like Hobby Lobby essentially the same exemption that applied to non-profit religious organizations. They would fill out a form, saying they had an objection to providing contraceptive insurance, and the employees would then have to work directly with their insurers if they wanted contraceptive insurance, right?</p>
                        <p>37:20 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:20 Peter: It seems like that might be a compromise of sorts, but Conservative companies have challenged that, saying, "Even that is a burden on their religious exercise because they claim it makes them complicit in the provision of insurance." They tell the government that they are opting out, and that sets in motion a chain of events that ultimately leads to people getting contraception. That issue is now before the Supreme Court again, and it goes to show what these people are after. They aren't looking for compromise. They aren't looking for accommodation. They are looking to impose their psychotic culture war bullshit on everyone else.</p>
                        <p>38:02 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:03 Rhiannon: Yeah, it goes back to exactly what I said before, which is that Hobby Lobby, what they would like to be able to say is we don't want our employees spending their wages that they earned at our company on things we object to. And again, if a Muslim owner was saying like, I don't know, "I don't want my employees spending a lot of money on food because it's Ramadan." It's absolutely insane. It's ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>38:28 Michael: Right. It's wild because it's like... It's not saying you want an exemption from the law. It's like saying the law doesn't apply to us.</p>
                        <p>38:35 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:35 Michael: We shouldn't have to notify you that we're not complying with the law, because we just... We're just not gonna obey the law.</p>
                        <p>38:40 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>38:41 Michael: That's not for us.</p>
                        <p>38:42 Peter: Right, it's just placing Hobby Lobby's religion, as they describe it, above the rights of everyone else, regardless of what those rights look like substantively.</p>
                        <p>38:54 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>38:54 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:54 Peter: You might be listening to this and be a little bit confused because, in the early to mid-2000s, the political right had sort of centralized around religion, right? In the Bush years, Evangelical Christianity felt like it was the driving force behind American Conservatism, and now it feels that the right has become completely untethered from it. And that might feel to you as if those are just different ideologies, or something, but it's important to remember that religion is not their ideology, fascism is. Fascism is about control centered in a small group, and religion is just leverage to these people. And that's not to say that there aren't people, probably like Sam Alito, who are religious ideologues, religious zealots, but the movement is not driven by zealotry, right? Religion is just a symbol, that they are good and right, and that is a guiding light for them to allow themselves to suppress their opposition by whatever means necessary.</p>
                        <p>40:09 Michael: Their goals and their mission are righteous, right? They have God and the flag behind them, and so it doesn't matter if they're the minority. It doesn't matter if what they're doing is anti-democratic, authoritarian, because they've got God on their side.</p>
                        <p>40:27 Rhiannon: And the means justify the ends. Look at this case, what is the result? The result is that women who work for Hobby Lobby don't get their contraceptive access and reproductive rights supported, and that's...</p>
                        <p>40:42 Peter: That's the ends.</p>
                        <p>40:43 Rhiannon: The point. [laughter] That's the point.</p>
                        <p>40:45 Peter: It's an important point because when you talk about the ends justifying the means, you might think that the ends are religious freedom and the means are the suppression of contraception, but it's the other way around.</p>
                        <p>41:00 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>41:03 Peter: So we've talked about the burden on women who need contraception a bit, and I think that speaks for itself in a lot of ways, but as we wrap up, I wanna make a broader point about the relationship between employers and employees, because the average person's life is controlled by their employer in countless ways. They control a significant chunk of your waking hours, they can tell you what to wear and how to carry yourself. In many states, they control your personal affiliations, your political affiliations. And for some reason, in this country, if you want a decent healthcare plan, you have to do it through your employer. Huge numbers of Americans work for large corporations, considerably more than work for small businesses, and that leaves vast swathes of Americans at the mercy of a very small number of very wealthy people. And to put that in perspective, less than 1% of businesses employ over half of the private sector workforce, so when you hear the court weighing the religious rights of employers against the reproductive rights of employees, you need to keep in mind that they're weighing the religious rights of a handful of obscenely wealthy employers against the reproductive rights of millions. And the court...</p>
                        <p>42:23 Michael: Sorry, I thought you were at the end of the sentence there.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>42:27 Peter: I know, I was but...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:30 Michael: I'm sorry, 'cause...</p>
                        <p>42:32 Rhiannon: What were you gonna say?</p>
                        <p>42:33 Michael: You seem like you're on a roll, but I didn't realize.</p>
                        <p>42:36 Peter: I felt like I was on a roll, to be honest.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:41 Michael: I was gonna say obscurely wealthy Republican donors.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:44 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>42:44 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>42:46 Peter: The nature of the relationship between employers and employees is such that one literally controls the livelihood of the other, but Conservatives have made it a priority to fight for the rights of employers, and they've done it by pretending that this imbalance of power doesn't exist. The result is a world where some dipshit CEO, who is clearly out of his fucking mind, buying thousands of fake artifacts the world over, can dictate the access that thousands and thousands of people have to contraception. So remember that the next time you hear someone say that this case is about religious freedom, it's not. It's about another one of the ways in which wealthy and powerful people control how the rest of us live.</p>
                        <p>43:35 Rhiannon: Fuck out of here.</p>
                        <p>43:36 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>43:44 Peter: Next week is Hernandez v. Mesa, a case about whether or not it's cool for a border patrol agent to shoot a Mexican child from across the border.</p>
                        <p>43:55 Rhiannon: It's a rough one. Go ahead and schedule your therapy appointment for Tuesday afternoon.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>44:02 Peter: And we've got our first guest, University of Texas, Professor Stephen Vladeck. One little note about him, he argued the case. Okay? We're getting heavy hitters.</p>

                        <p>00:03 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh from Fiasco and Slow Burn. On this week's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are going back nearly 100 years to Buck v. Bell, the case in which the Supreme Court found that forced sterilization of the mentally ill was constitutional, as long as it was done for the protection and health of the state.</p>
                        <p>00:24 [Archival]: Thirty-three states had a eugenics program in the early 1900s, most ended after World War II. However, North Carolina's program ran until 1974.</p>
                        <p>00:34 Leon: The ruling, which assumed a connection between mental illness and criminality, has never been overturned.</p>
                        <p>00:41 [Archival]: Immigrant women coming across the border were simply sterilized against their will, often without their knowledge, thousands of them.</p>
                        <p>00:51 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:01 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have burrowed into America's chest cavity, like that little alien in the 1979 movie, Alien.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:16 Michael: The Xenomorph.</p>
                        <p>01:16 Peter: Sure, you fucking nerd.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:21 Rhiannon: I hate both of you, yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:23 Peter: I am Peter, Twitter is @The_Law_Boy. I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Rhiannon: Hello.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Peter: And today's case is Buck v. Bell, a case from 1927. And I know we usually cover more recent cases, but sometimes it's important to look back. You need to watch Citizen Kane before you can really understand Avengers Infinity War, y'know... You have to really dig into the classics. And this is a classic written by maybe the most influential Supreme Court Justice of all time, Oliver Wendell Holmes. This is a case about whether states can constitutionally engage in eugenics by sterilizing people they deem mentally unfit. This case, I think, gets a little less attention than like, Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson, but it is widely considered one of the cruelest Supreme Court decisions of all time. A showcase, not just for the callousness of the Court, but its lack of concern for the facts, the many ways in which it was and is intertwined with the most reprehensible aspects of elite American institutions, and it's also a precursor to modern cases, where the courts have endorsed the basic notion that disabled people are not inherently deserving of the rights granted to the rest of us.</p>
                        <p>02:55 Peter: So again, Oliver Wendell Holmes, maybe the single most famous lawyer in American history. He was a Supreme Court Justice from 1902 to 1932, and he was known for his sort of concise, common sense approach to the law. He was by the standards of his time fairly progressive, but don't let that fool you, because this was at a time where you could get a PhD in the shape of the Chinese skull.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:24 Peter: So despite that reputation, the decision here, not the most progressive thing I've ever read, let's put it that way.</p>
                        <p>03:35 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:35 Michael: So Rhiannon, talk to us about the background. Let's talk eugenics.</p>
                        <p>03:40 Rhiannon: Let's talk eugenics, folks. Yeah, so eugenics as a belief system or just this area of pseudo-scientific study, became a thing back in the 1880s, and it really gained popularity, especially in the United States, in the early 1900s. And when we say eugenics, we're talking about this idea that humanity can improve the genetic quality of a human population by excluding groups that are judged to be inferior...</p>
                        <p>04:09 Michael: Excluding from reproduction.</p>
                        <p>04:12 Rhiannon: Right, right. From, right... Excluding from the genetic pool, yeah. Yes.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:17 Michael: Right. Yes.</p>
                        <p>04:17 Rhiannon: Yes. And so I don't think it will come as a major surprise to anybody that this idea was all the rage in the United States among white wealthy elites, and it's gotta be said that it was a popular trend in the progressive movement. So for example, at the first International Congress of Eugenics in 1912, which was held in London, 42 of 58 research papers presented were authored by American researchers, so white wealthy Americans are all about eugenics at this time. Now, in 1910...</p>
                        <p>04:53 Michael: Not anymore. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:55 Rhiannon: No, no, no, no, surely not. Yeah, don't worry. [chuckle] In 1910, the Carnegie Institute established the Eugenics Record Office, which served as a center for eugenics and human hereditary research and propaganda. Basically, it was this great, big, beautiful think tank that was advocating for not letting "undesirable" people procreate. And the ERO, this Eugenics Records Office, developed a model sterilization statute, promoting this idea that states should adopt sterilization laws, and since they had it reviewed by legal experts and politicians, they were saying, this law is actually... It's constitutionally sound. It won't be struck down, so all of you guys go for it, adopt these laws and be white supremacists.</p>
                        <p>05:43 Michael: It's like the model penal code for bigots.</p>
                        <p>05:45 Rhiannon: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>05:48 Peter: Well, the model penal code is the model penal code for bigots.</p>
                        <p>05:50 Michael: The model penal code.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:54 Michael: They're all bigots.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:54 Michael: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>05:56 Rhiannon: Correct. And so the state of Virginia or the Commonwealth of Virginia, excuse me, passes...</p>
                        <p>06:00 Peter: Please do not embarrass us, Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:01 Peter: We're holding ourselves out here as experts. Do not call the Commonwealth of Virginia a state.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:12 Rhiannon: I apologize. So Virginia passes its sterilization law based largely on this model language from the Eugenics Record Office, and the result is the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924. Basically, the text of that law says that whenever the superintendents of these state hospitals and institutions for the mentally unfit, whenever those superintendents "shall be of opinion that it is for the best interest of the patients and of society that an inmate of the institution under their care should be sexually sterilized, such superintendent is hereby authorized to perform or cause to be performed by some capable physicians or surgeon, the operation of sterilization on any such patient confined in such institution who is afflicted with hereditary forms of insanity that are recurrent, idiocy, imbecility, feeble-mindedness or epilepsy."</p>
                        <p>07:11 Peter: Or epilepsy.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:13 Rhiannon: Right, or epilepsy, or this other medical condition. We'll just throw that in there.</p>
                        <p>07:19 Michael: Why not?</p>
                        <p>07:20 Peter: I just wanna say it's funny as hell to me, especially because this sort of stuff is done with such confidence by these people, but all of their medical diagnoses are just vaguely identifying people who they think are stupid and then giving that a label and pretending that it's a real medical condition. So you'd bring your child to the doctor and be like, "You know, doctor, he's not good at math." And the doctor would like run some tests and come back and be like, "Ma'am, I'm sorry to tell you this, but your child is a moron."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:54 Peter: And they were like, "Oh, shit." What's wrong with Timmy? Well, yeah, he's a moron.</p>
                        <p>08:00 Rhiannon: There's no cure.</p>
                        <p>08:01 Peter: All of the medical diagnoses are now just insults because they're just completely distant from any actual issue. At issue in this case, is whether someone is an imbecile.</p>
                        <p>08:14 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:16 Peter: A absolutely meaningless term, and I just fucking love the idea that people were walking around with these as actual medical diagnoses like 100 years ago.</p>
                        <p>08:23 Michael: Right, can you imagine like a DSM back then that has a different criteria for imbecile and feeble-minded, like a dedicated doctor being like, "This is a tough one to disambiguate. They might be feeble-minded but I'm leaning imbecile."</p>
                        <p>08:39 Peter: Yeah, "We thought Johnny was an imbecile, it turns out he's just an idiot."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:46 Michael: Thank God.</p>
                        <p>08:46 Peter: Thank God.</p>
                        <p>08:50 Rhiannon: Included in the text of the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924 is this built-in justification that forced sterilization of the "feeble-minded," that this is for the greater good of society, and they put this in the text of the law. They say, "Whereas many defective persons are basically being supported at state institutions, many defective persons who, if now discharged or paroled, would likely become by the propagation of their kind a menace to society, but who if incapable of procreating might properly and safely be discharged or paroled and become self-supporting with benefit to both themselves and to society, whereas human experience has demonstrated that heredity plays an important part in the transmission of sanity, idiocy, imbecility, epilepsy and crime."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:48 Peter: By the way, I love that they've brought epilepsy into this.</p>
                        <p>09:51 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>09:52 Michael: Like epilepsy is... It's ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>09:54 Peter: There's literally five or six just completely fictitious ailments and then they're like, "And epilepsy," which apparently they were on the head, they were nailing it with that one. But also I feel like the idea that epileptics need to be like bred out of society...</p>
                        <p>10:07 Michael: Sterilized.</p>
                        <p>10:11 Peter: Seems a little bit strong.</p>
                        <p>10:11 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, but when you take a step back and look at it, it kind of makes sense that the nation's top legal experts, researchers, scientists and doctors thought this, because at the time, they think a woman having her period every month is a debilitating medical issue for which she needs to take heroin or whatever. It's par for the course, I guess.</p>
                        <p>10:31 Peter: Yeah, well.</p>
                        <p>10:32 Michael: And it sounds pretty cool to me.</p>
                        <p>10:33 Peter: Yeah, I don't...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:37 Michael: I've never had menstrual cramps, but heroin sounds a lot better than Midol.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:40 Peter: Sorry you guys were oppressed by the free drugs you got.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:47 Rhiannon: Okay. And an important side note, the same year that this Sterilization Act is passed in Virginia, the Virginia legislator also passes the Racial Integrity Act, which banned interracial marriage and was famously later struck down in Loving v. Virginia. So sterilization, eugenics and racism. It's not like a very far connecting line.</p>
                        <p>11:11 Peter: No.</p>
                        <p>11:13 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:13 Peter: No. A lot of people are gonna be judgmental about this stuff and say that these states were going nuts, but you gotta keep in mind, this is before the Nazis showed us that this was bad. The Nazis took all of this stuff to its natural conclusion, and people were like, oh, they're like, I see where this is headed now, yeah, we gotta stop. We gotta stop.</p>
                        <p>11:37 Michael: The "are we the baddies?" meme, but it's like America is asking the Nazis that. It's like, "Yeah, you are."</p>
                        <p>11:44 Peter: By the way, it's important to note, though, Adolf Hitler looked towards a lot of this research and a lot of these laws in designing the apparatus, the eugenics system that they had in Nazi, Germany.</p>
                        <p>12:00 Rhiannon: Absolutely. Obviously, the Carnegie Institute is involved here. Henry Ford is like a famous eugenicist and racist. The Rockefellers are putting out this kind of "research" at the time. This was really popular among wealthy people who had a platform to be disseminating this stuff. Okay, so Virginia gets this sterilization law on the books and they are basically immediately ready to implement it and fight over it and fight for it. So this guy, Albert Sidney Priddy, at the time, in 1924, he is the superintendent of the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and the Feeble-minded.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:37 Rhiannon: It's no five-star hotel stay, I can tell you that.</p>
                        <p>12:40 Peter: I want to apologize for constantly laughing at this stuff, but it's so fucking ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>12:45 Rhiannon: It's absurd.</p>
                        <p>12:45 Michael: It is. It's absurd.</p>
                        <p>12:47 Rhiannon: Exactly. It's so cruel that it's absurd. And so Albert Sidney Priddy, the superintendent, he files a petition to the directors of this institution to compel the sterilization of a patient named Carrie Buck. Carrie is an 18-year-old patient at the institution, and it's reported that she has a mental age of 9 years old. In the petition where he's providing justification for why she should be sterilized, Priddy says that Buck is a threat to society, and he says that Carrie's mother had a mental age of 8 in addition to reportedly having a history of prostitution, immorality and parenting three illegitimate children. And so though Carrie had been adopted by another family and attended school until sixth grade, Priddy further noted in this report that she eventually just became "incorrigible" and at the age of 17, she gave birth to an illegitimate child. So at that point, her adopted family said they're incapable of caring for Carrie, and they had her committed to the State Colony, this institution.</p>
                        <p>13:53 Peter: Look, they gave it their best for three, four years, but at the end of the day, she had some pre-marital sex and you gotta give them to the State Colony for Epileptics and Idiots.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:06 Rhiannon: And so they basically informed Carrie that she is going to undergo this sterilization procedure and she challenges it in court. Now, the named parties, obviously Carrie Buck versus Bell. Bell is the doctor, the surgeon who will perform the sterilization surgery, so that's how we get the case name Buck v. Bell.</p>
                        <p>14:27 Michael: Can I ask a question quick? I didn't see this in my background research, I don't know if any of you guys saw it, how this case came to be, was she like the impetus or was there people looking for plaintiffs on this or what, do we know?</p>
                        <p>14:40 Rhiannon: It's not clear, but the case itself is collusive. They're doing it on purpose to bring the case so that it goes through the courts so that it will be upheld.</p>
                        <p>14:50 Michael: Oh, okay. I was just thinking along the lines of somebody getting a lawyer and challenging this procedure doesn't really fit a 9-year-old's mental capabilities. But that makes sense.</p>
                        <p>15:01 Rhiannon: The whole thing is rigged. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:04 Peter: So let's talk about the law a little bit, and this law is challenged under the 14th Amendment's due process and equal protection provisions, which say that the states shall not "deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of the laws." And so the question is whether forced sterilization imposes on the bodily integrity of these women in violation of their entitlement to due process of law and/or equal protection under the 14th Amendment. And the Court holds that it is not a violation of the 14th Amendment, finding that all three generations of Buck women were "feeble-minded" and "promiscuous," and that the state had a legitimate interest in their sterilization.</p>
                        <p>16:02 Peter: And the Court starts out by stating the reasons for the law, saying that the sterilization of mental defectives is for the benefit of the patient and society generally, and that the sterilization allows mental asylums and similar institutions to discharge those patients without concern that they might reproduce.</p>
                        <p>16:25 Michael: Awful. It's so awful.</p>
                        <p>16:28 Peter: And the court notes, "Experience has shown that heredity plays an important part in the transmission of insanity, imbecility, etcetera." I love the etcetera there. You know, you know, these guys...</p>
                        <p>16:44 Rhiannon: But note, that's a direct lifting from the Virginia statute that's at issue, right? They just... They adopt it.</p>
                        <p>16:51 Peter: It's a very weird thing to say, "experience has shown" when we're talking about a scientific question.</p>
                        <p>16:56 Michael: There's another etcetera that I really liked when he's describing the law and he says, "Look, the health of the patient and the welfare of society may be promoted in certain cases by the sterilization of mental defectives under careful safeguard, etcetera." Like whatever.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:17 Michael: Whatever that entails.</p>
                        <p>17:21 Peter: A couple things. One is that this opinion is like three pages long, and the dissent is silent. It's just someone saying they dissent. And then also you have this like etcetera thing. Being a Supreme Court Justice back then was the shit. You didn't have to do anything. He's like, "Yeah, you know, insanity, imbecility, etcetera. I'm gonna throw in an etcetera in here."</p>
                        <p>17:41 Michael: I don't know what copies you read, but the PDF I found included both briefs, which brought it to a grand total of eight pages.</p>
                        <p>17:53 Rhiannon: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>17:53 Peter: That's right. I found that one too.</p>
                        <p>17:56 Michael: The briefs were about two pages each, worth the read. Very interesting.</p>
                        <p>18:01 Peter: One key theme here is like the sheer confidence the Court has in what is now clearly completely outmoded science. And that combines with this sort of underlying moral assumption that the life of a disabled person is both a burden on society and less important than that of a non-disabled person. And the Court explains that the superintendents of the institutions like the State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-minded must before sterilizing anyone petition their board, there would be evidence presented and the person could appeal the decision to sterilize them to the County Circuit Court. And so Holmes is trying to say like, "Look, obviously procedurally, this is airtight."</p>
                        <p>18:52 Peter: We're all good. Don't even worry about it. And he says that the benefit to society justifies the sterilization here, and it's worth noting that Holmes doesn't really provide any actual reasoning. Part of this is like a relic of court decisions from the time which were... They're shorter, they're more conclusory. But in any event, he genuinely gives zero thought in the opinion to what the burden imposed on these women actually is, and 'cause there's no discussion about the importance of the ability to procreate if you want to or to try. Nothing is articulated about what they're actually being subjected to. Instead, he frames it in terms of sacrifice, saying that the general welfare often calls upon citizens to sacrifice their lives and well-being, which I guess is true in the general sense, but I mean, first of all, could be used to justify literally anything.</p>
                        <p>19:49 Peter: And this is 1927, we're about a decade out from World War I, and it seems clear that he's gesturing towards that sort of sentiment accompanied by war and the massive human toll that faces. But he's not talking about the domination of Europe by Austrians or whatever. He's telling some lady, "You can't have your dumb kids, your kids are gonna be too stupid, lady. Let me tell you about sacrifice." [laughter] And Holmes ends this opinion with what might be the most offensive few sentences in Supreme Court history.</p>
                        <p>20:30 Michael: It's awful.</p>
                        <p>20:32 Rhiannon: This is rough.</p>
                        <p>20:34 Peter: This is a quote. "We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the state for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes. Three generations of imbeciles is enough." End of the opinion.</p>
                        <p>21:21 Rhiannon: Ouch.</p>
                        <p>21:23 Peter: Three generations of imbeciles is enough.</p>
                        <p>21:25 Rhiannon: I don't feel good. Do you guys feel good?</p>
                        <p>21:27 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>21:27 Peter: No. Obviously, that is transparently horrific. It is ridiculous, and I don't think there's much more to say about it. There is a fact, though, that we should discuss, and that is that underlying all of this reasoning, the Court is accepting without question that these people are in fact mentally deficient somehow. And on that front, I have bad news. Most likely, they were not. And in fact, the story, as we understand it, appears to be fairly horrific.</p>
                        <p>22:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right. It's like multiple layers of being horrific. So first, let's just start with the law and the court case itself. By all accounts, the case, bringing the legal challenge was actually a purposeful act of collusion. The state of Virginia wanted a sterilization law and they wanted it to pass legal challenge, so as superintendent of one of these state institutions, that guy, Priddy, was looking for a patient to do forced sterilization on and have it be challenged in court. John Bell was the surgeon who performed the surgery on Carrie Buck, and he wrote in his surgical report in October 1927, "This is the first case operated on under the sterilization law, and the case was carried through the courts of the state and the United States Supreme Court to test the constitutionality of the Virginia act." So this was brought on purpose, and Carrie Buck was the random unconsenting party that this legal challenge was brought on.</p>
                        <p>23:11 Rhiannon: Secondly, there is a lot of doubt that Carrie Buck was at all intellectually disabled to begin with. Not only do reports from researchers and people who knew her indicate that she was by all accounts of average intelligence. One of the main arguments used to establish her disability was her supposed promiscuity and that she got pregnant at the age of 17. Well, it turns out, actually, that Carrie Buck was raped by a member of the family that adopted her, and that rape resulted in her pregnancy. And it's been reported that the family who adopted her, they actually had her committed to the state institution on purpose to save their reputation.</p>
                        <p>23:54 Peter: And this is what we in the law call a big oopsie-daisy.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>24:03 Peter: You commit someone to a horrific institution to cover up a rape, some fucking Shutter Island-style asylum, and then it turns out they're not disabled at all, but you sterilize them. Big apologies from the legal community, really dropped the ball on this one.</p>
                        <p>24:22 Rhiannon: Awful. Right, and regarding this "three generations of imbeciles" that Justice Holmes referred to, actually not a lot is known about Carrie's mother, Emma Buck, except that she was poor, she was abandoned by her husband early in marriage after being accused of immorality, prostitution and having syphilis. She was also committed to the same institution, this Virginia State Colony for the Feeble-minded, and then there's Carrie's daughter, who was named Vivian. And like her mom, Vivian was also of reportedly average intelligence. She attended school for a few years where she received average or even above average grades. She died at the age of 8 due to complications from measles. But again, the cruelty of this "the three generations of imbeciles," there aren't even facts that support that realistically.</p>
                        <p>25:13 Peter: Also, a society that is condemning people it deems stupid to institutions and sterilization, but can't cure the fucking measles.</p>
                        <p>25:25 Michael: I also have my doubts about promiscuity being one of the criteria here. Whether or not she was raped, I think that goes to just...</p>
                        <p>25:36 Peter: Yeah. If I had to guess, they're just... It's literally a series of checkboxes when they're compelling someone live in one of these institutions and they're just looking for things like, "Oh, she's promiscuous," right?</p>
                        <p>25:50 Rhiannon: Right, right. And then finally, just to highlight how rampant this eugenics stuff was, as soon as the states got the green light from the Supreme Court on sterilization statutes like this, the State of Virginia was so giddy for this family to not be able to reproduce that Carrie Buck's sister, Doris Buck, was also forcibly sterilized. She actually wasn't told that that procedure was being done to her, it happened completely without her consent during what she was told was a surgery for appendicitis. She never knew why she couldn't conceive until she learned the real reason why in 1980, lived her whole life not knowing that this had happened to her.</p>
                        <p>26:31 Michael: Fuck. Jesus.</p>
                        <p>26:35 Peter: So I wanna talk a bit about eugenics and these elite academic institutions that were pushing it. In the early 1900s, the idea of forced sterilization to eliminate heritable disorders was popular in mainstream academia. Oliver Wendell Holmes authored this opinion. He has close ties to Harvard, he went there. His father was dean of the medical school and Harvard was pushing these theories very aggressively. A huge percentage of the scholarship about eugenics and promoting eugenics came out of Harvard. And all of this is to say that powerful institutions in this country work in close concert. Elite universities and instruments of government power, like the Court, are often composed of the same people from the same socioeconomic classes, and so you often see them serving the same interests, and the overlap of dubious academic work with the courts isn't like some ancient thing. Just to give a slightly more recent example, in the '80s, the field of law and economics gained steam in academia, in legal academia, designed to more aggressively map economic theory onto the practice of law, very, very popular at that time, still maintains some popularity today. The one thing you need to know about law and economics is that if someone is an expert in neither law nor economics, that does not rule you out from being a professor of law and economics.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:12 Rhiannon: Right, right. That's all you need to know.</p>
                        <p>28:13 Peter: It's a bullshit little field that just combines the most fraudulent aspects of economic theory with the law.</p>
                        <p>28:21 Rhiannon: Most notably at the University of Chicago, right? Law school?</p>
                        <p>28:24 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:25 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>28:25 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's their big...</p>
                        <p>28:27 Michael: The center of the intellectual movement there.</p>
                        <p>28:29 Peter: And just a quick note before we move on, Rhiannon referenced this earlier. We often deal with reactionary politics on this podcast and, obviously, I think we all believe that eugenics is fundamentally reactionary, but it needs to be noted that it was closely tied to the progressive movement at the turn of the 20th century. I bring this up mostly because if you're progressive or otherwise on the left, I think it's important to acknowledge that the movement got caught up in this dangerous thinking at one point. And being intellectually honest about that sort of shit is part of what separates us from the right, because Planned Parenthood has admitted to their founder, Margaret Sanger, believed in eugenics and they've denounced those beliefs. But the American conservative movement, rather than admitting to their past failures, maintains an entire cottage industry dedicated to rewriting history to make believe that they aren't the villains the entire fucking time. So you have these fucking weirdo freaks, like Dinesh D'Souza, who do nothing but churn out books saying that "Oh, the KKK were liberals actually." And like Nazis, national socialism, socialism's in the name.</p>
                        <p>29:44 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>29:45 Michael: They're right there.</p>
                        <p>29:47 Peter: Shit like that. Then that passes for actual scholarship and intellectual honesty on the right and it's important to just look back and reflect on your movement's errors and not be one of these fucking morons. They go through all these links to say, "Back in the 1870s, the KKK were all Democrats." But the simple question would be, "What party do you think the modern KKK identifies with?"</p>
                        <p>30:14 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>30:15 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:15 Peter: Another thing I wanna point out is Buck v. Bell hasn't been overturned.</p>
                        <p>30:21 Rhiannon: Still on the books.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>30:22 Michael: Nope. It's law.</p>
                        <p>30:23 Peter: And that's not to say that it's consistently relied upon by the Court or anything, it's not the point we wanna make entirely. A huge component of our legal system is its reliance on the body of common law, meaning the law that comes from judicial decisions. And that reliance is predicated on the idea that that body of law is the manifestation of reasonable and reliable legal principles that have been passed down over time. But the reality is that the common law is littered with outdated relics of reasoning and science and history, like this case, and that is what our law is built on. The law is predicated on the assumption that our predecessors were eminently wise but, of course, they had all the same flaws of judges today. They were uninformed, biased, hubristic, and it's crucial for the legal profession to operate as if those flaws are present and not as if the passage of time has bestowed a sort of untouchability on the past.</p>
                        <p>31:26 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:26 Peter: The way that precedent works is that courts are made to rely on existing rules rather than question their wisdom or utility. Obviously, the primary purpose of this is to promote consistency in the law. But not only does it lead to the entrenchment of some horrible ideas, it's inherently conservative.</p>
                        <p>31:45 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>31:45 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:46 Peter: This plainly outrageous case law can't be easily disregarded, because judges are told to respect precedent and instead, it needs to be rooted out steadily over the course of many years, to the point where it's still on the books today.</p>
                        <p>32:03 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:04 Michael: Right. All that being said, it is actually true, though, that as recently as 2001, a federal appeals court and the Eighth Circuit cited Buck v. Bell approvingly in holding that involuntary sterilization of the mentally handicapped could be constitutional with the right procedural protections, which is pretty indistinguishable from Buck v. Bell itself.</p>
                        <p>32:30 Rhiannon: Things are not good. Things are not good.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:34 Rhiannon: I'm just putting up the alarm.</p>
                        <p>32:38 Peter: Look, that was... You said 2001, was it pre-9/11?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:45 Michael: Yeah, exactly. Things really changed. Yeah, we have to reckon with the idea that eugenics have never really left us. Like this era was plainly horrible, and I don't wanna say everything is the same or whatever, but states, I think in that era sterilized 65,000 "disabled people" and you might think, well, when I say the eugenics era, this case is a century old, so that means forever ago, but like North Carolina was operating its program until 1974.</p>
                        <p>33:18 Rhiannon: Wow.</p>
                        <p>33:18 Michael: And of course, Rhiannon gestured to this earlier, but in the South, everywhere really, there is racial and class components to this. In the South, for example, it's tended to fall most heavily on the Black community, which interestingly enough, in its short two pages, the plaintiff's brief sort of anticipated that. So it's not like people didn't know that that might be the case. In Buck v Bell, they're saying, "Look, this could be turned to sterilize Black and poor people." And there you go.</p>
                        <p>33:52 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, and we also still to this day have this idea that somehow genetically inferior people are the ones who are more likely to commit crime. And there's a way that White supremacy connects genetic inferiority to criminal behavior to justify, still to this day, this kind of eugenics-adjacent stuff in the criminal punishment system. So for example, in 2009, a woman in West Virginia was required to get her tubes tied at the age of 21 years old, as part of the requirements of her probation deal. The offense for which she was going on probation? Marijuana possession.</p>
                        <p>34:30 Michael: Jesus!</p>
                        <p>34:32 Peter: Do you know who the judge was in that case and what their address was?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:37 Rhiannon: I do not, I do not, actually.</p>
                        <p>34:40 Peter: Just asking, just wondering. Thinking out loud.</p>
                        <p>34:43 Rhiannon: Okay, sure, yeah. [chuckle] In 2017, really recently, a Tennessee judge issued a standing order that offered inmates a 30-day reduction in their sentence if they underwent some sort of long-term or permanent birth control procedure. So that's if men got vasectomies or if women got a four-year birth control implant. And this idea, they make it legal by keeping it voluntary. It's not forced on anybody, but of course, this is super coercive if you're sitting in jail and you can't get out. And we don't have to think long about who this disparately impacts. A policy like this is never going to touch a rich person, because a rich person is never going to be in the position where they can't get out of jail at the time that they wanna get out, where their lack of resources is the thing that's keeping them locked up and repeating into the system. And obviously, this is gonna impact people of color more who are pulled into the criminal punishment system at higher rates than everybody else.</p>
                        <p>35:44 Michael: Also pretty fucked up. You only get a 30-day reduction? What the fuck?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>35:52 Michael: Come on, man.</p>
                        <p>35:54 Peter: You can't give them three months?</p>
                        <p>35:54 Michael: I would expect something substantial. Fucking 30 days? And what the fuck!</p>
                        <p>36:01 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's a really fucked up point because it shows how little they think about a person's right to reproduce.</p>
                        <p>36:10 Peter: Right. And do you... You said it was a Tennessee judge. Do you know that judge's address?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:17 Rhiannon: No, I failed to write that down in my outline today.</p>
                        <p>36:23 Peter: Okay. Well, our promise to our listeners is if we figure it out, we will let you know.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:27 Rhiannon: Another horrible example, just in 2013, the Center for Investigative Reporting found that at least 148 female inmates in California had received tubal ligations without their consent between 2006 and 2010. And just one year later, the Associated Press reported on at least four instances of prosecutors in Tennessee including birth control requirements in plea deals. So we're not that far away from this eugenics stuff still being part of the criminal justice system for sure.</p>
                        <p>37:06 Michael: Right, and the birth control, it's interesting. There's a real intersection of reproductive rights and disability rights where the eugenics stuff still comes up a lot. And so there's the Eighth Circuit case I mentioned earlier, which was... That was about a woman with developmental disabilities and she had to agree to sterilization in order to regain custody of her child who had already been born, obviously, and who'd been taken from her.</p>
                        <p>37:36 Peter: Okay, you can have them, but you only get one.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:39 Michael: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>37:40 Rhiannon: It's wild.</p>
                        <p>37:42 Michael: It's so fucked.</p>
                        <p>37:43 Rhiannon: That's just awful.</p>
                        <p>37:45 Michael: When pod favorite Brett Kavanaugh was still a judge on the DC Circuit, he wrote an opinion upholding a law that denied people with developmental disabilities the right to make their own medical decisions, which sounds like not great, but not really eugenics necessarily, until you realize that two of the plaintiffs in that case had been forced to have abortions under the law.</p>
                        <p>38:11 Peter: That's how we get conservatives to support abortion. Forcing poor people to have them, and all of a sudden, they're like, "Actually, I get it."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>38:22 Michael: The National Council of Disability published something in 2012 that found that 11 states still had laws on the books authorizing involuntary sterilization for people with hereditary forms of "idiocy, imbecility" or other similar sorts of offensively and outmodedly-named conditions.</p>
                        <p>38:45 Peter: Libertarians.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>38:49 Rhiannon: I wish.</p>
                        <p>38:52 Michael: And even when people with disabilities are allowed to have kids, they have their kids taken from them by protective services and shit like that, and there's a whole culture now of sort of parents agreeing to sterilizing their kids while they're still young if they have disabilities. So eugenics is still with us, unfortunately, and in precisely the way that Bell conceives of it. And you can see it with COVID too, right?</p>
                        <p>39:25 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:26 Michael: It's sort of like resonating. It's hard not to think of COVID when hospitals are talking about people with disabilities not necessarily being able to get ventilators, if they have to ration. And you might think, "Well, look, if they have asthma, that's understandable." But fucking Alabama had a law up until April 2020, their Crisis Standards of Care, that allowed...</p>
                        <p>39:52 Peter: Hold on, hold on, I'm checking my calendar here. Okay.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>39:54 Michael: Yeah, April 2020, that was the last month. That allowed for the denial or cessation of ventilator services for people with mental disabilities. It's not even like a number of years, like life expectancy. It's just literally like, "Well, fucking dumb people, they don't really deserve as good or as long a life as smart people." Right?</p>
                        <p>40:21 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>40:22 Michael: And they only changed that because the federal government stepped in. And then the last thing is like with COVID is like the sacrifice we talked about. When the opinion in Buck v. Bell talks about sacrifice, that doesn't sound too dissimilar from a lot of right-wingers right now talking about COVID, whether it's like, "Well, look, we gotta re-open the economy, and if some people die, well, like, I gotta get my fucking Triple Dipper at Chili's."</p>
                        <p>40:48 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>40:49 Rhiannon: Those Southwestern egg rolls hit different.</p>
                        <p>40:52 Michael: Yeah, that's right. That's in my order. [laughter] You better believe it. The other thing that sounds like remarkably familiar, is when Holmes talks about not having to deal with their children being criminals, which is literally an argument in Freakonomics, that a bunch of pseudo-intellectual types thought was like so persuasive, that the legalization of abortion led to a down tick in crime 20 years later, because all of a sudden all these undesirables were not having kids, which is... It's just straight eugenics is what that is. And bullshit pseudo-science, or not even that.</p>
                        <p>41:32 Peter: Right. All of this to say that Buck v. Bell is not exactly a relic of the past. This case is unique only in how concisely and obviously it brutalizes these women, but there is a tradition in American legislation of laws that take for granted that there are genetically superior and genetically inferior classes of people, and courts have failed to address them as the obvious violations of constitutional rights and human dignity that they are.</p>
                        <p>42:04 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah. What comes to mind when I think about this case and how eugenics kind of have made their way, especially into our criminal system, I think a lot about right-wing narratives about supposed personal responsibility and morality, and how those ideas really purposely ignore the relationship between what is personal and individual and the system, what is systemic. And that's because people on the right don't want to account for a system that would meet everyone's needs, right? They want there to be a separation between what the system provides for all of us and the horrible things that happen to people in their lives, and so it's this making it about a very individual, individualized reading of how a person's life plays out rather than being about poor people or minorities needing access to resources to live good lives.</p>
                        <p>42:58 Peter: The idea that you can stomp out crime by sterilizing criminals is fundamentally at odds with every expert on crime's understanding of how it originates and manifests. That sort of thinking is endemic to the conservative movement and to conservative ideology. There is a specific intent on their part to take systemic problems and atomize them down to a personal level, so that the systemic issues do not need to be addressed, and instead individual people can be blamed. And you can see that in things like unemployment. If you don't have a job, conservatives would say, it's your fault. Right? How do they explain unemployment going up by tens of millions of people when COVID happens? They don't have a coherent solution for problems like that, because their entire ideology is predicated around taking systemic issues and blaming people who are functionally victims of those issues for them.</p>
                        <p>44:10 Rhiannon: Exactly. Right.</p>
                        <p>44:12 Michael: Right. Their solution is open it back up.</p>
                        <p>44:15 Peter: Right. The solution is...</p>
                        <p>44:17 Michael: And when people don't...</p>
                        <p>44:17 Peter: The solution is, "Fuck you."</p>
                        <p>44:19 Michael: But people don't go out... Yeah, it's "Fuck you." As a small business owner, I only own the three used car dealerships, I wanna make my fucking employees come in and if they get sick, whatever, fuck it. They don't deserve unemployment benefits. And if nobody shows up, well, we should get the National Guard to march them. I'll tell you, the National Guard does not need to march me down to Chili's. [laughter] I miss it.</p>
                        <p>44:50 Peter: And look, this type of thinking is why we can't end this episode saying, "Thank God, society has moved on and the reasoning in Buck v. Bell is something you would never hear of now." Because we're all sitting in our apartments waiting for a fucking disease to burn through the population, so that we can all go start commuting to work again.</p>

                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: Well her argument next to number 84-6075, Ricky Wayne Tison and Raymond Curtis Tison v Arizona.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:11 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh, host of Fiasco and co-creator of Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4 Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about the concept of felony murder, which allows prosecutors to bring murder charges if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, even if the defendant doesn't kill anyone.</p>
                        <p>00:30 [Archival]: If you are engaged in a felony and someone is killed, it can be a co-defendant, it can be a suspect, it can be a witness, it can be someone else, you are still culpable for that murder, that homicide, that unlawful killing.</p>
                        <p>00:44 Leon Neyfakh: In 1987, felony murder came up before the Supreme Court in the context of capital punishment in a case called Tison v Arizona. The court held that two brothers, who did not commit or even plan a murder, could nonetheless be sentenced to death. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:09 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that hover over America like vultures over a dying man in the desert.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:23 Rhiannon: Perfect.</p>
                        <p>01:23 Peter: I am Peter, Twitter's @thelawboy, I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Michael: Hey everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:29 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Rhiannon: Hi everyone.</p>
                        <p>01:31 Peter: And today we are talking about Tison v. Arizona. This is a case about the death penalty, but more specifically and more importantly, it's a case about the felony murder rule. Felony murder is a rule whereby a person can be charged with murder if they commit a felony and someone else dies during the commission of that felony, even if they didn't actually kill them. So if person A steals a car, person B witnesses it and dies from a heart attack, person A could be charged with murdering them, and in some states, potentially sentenced to death. And the question here is whether sentencing someone to death under this rule violates the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The Eighth Amendment has long been a battlefield, mostly because the term cruel and unusual punishment doesn't have any clear meaning, and conservatives have had interesting approaches to this. Originalists, and we're not dealing with an originalist interpretation here today, but originalists, like Scalia, have interpreted it to mean what would have been cruel and unusual at the time of the constitution's passing.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>02:50 Rhiannon: God.</p>
                        <p>02:50 Peter: And, you know...</p>
                        <p>02:51 Michael: Bring back the iron cross or whatever, right?</p>
                        <p>02:53 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:53 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:55 Peter: And other conservatives have just taken all these other sort of wishy-washy approaches that we'll get into that sort of are designed to protect reactionary laws and reactionary institutions. So Rhi, wanna give us some background here?</p>
                        <p>03:12 Rhiannon: Sure thing.</p>
                        <p>03:14 Peter: Cause it's a juicy one.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>03:16 Rhiannon: Yeah, it definitely is. Just starting off with a little bit of legal background before, so obviously there's a long and fucked up history of the death penalty in general being litigated at the Supreme Court. And in fact, this isn't the only case where felony murder was at issue. So in 1982, actually just four years before this case, Tison goes up to the Supreme Court. The justice is held in Enmund v Florida that the death penalty can't be imposed on someone who did not kill, attempt to kill, or intend to kill another person. So that was in the case of a getaway driver, somebody was just in a car while other people went and robbed somebody, somebody died in the commission of the robbery and the getaway driver, the Supreme Court said, "That's not a murder that warrants eligibility for the death penalty." Now, the court that decides Enmund, those justices, it's basically the same court that, in 1986, Tison v Arizona comes to. Now, there is one difference in that Justice Scalia is now on the court, but it's basically... They traded out a conservative for a conservative, right? But all that said, the three justices who dissented in Enmund, which is to say these three justices would have wanted somebody who "participated" in a murder by just being a getaway driver, they would have wanted that person to be executed. Those three justices are now in the majority here.</p>
                        <p>04:43 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:44 Rhiannon: So the point of my saying this is that, at the time this comes to the Supreme Court, the rule is that you cannot be executed if you did not intentionally kill anyone. And this comes out of principles of proportionality, which is the general idea that the punishment should fit the crime, and an idea that you should only be eligible for the death penalty if you are "the worst of the worst," meaning you've committed the worst crime, murder, but committed it in the worst way, something that's especially heinous or cruel, etcetera. So moving into the factual background of this case. Just to set it up, when we're talking about why the result comes down differently here, just a few years after the Enmund case, up top got a say, this isn't just a getaway driver case, okay. This case comes out of a prison break. So a man named Gary Tison is incarcerated in Arizona, and he, along with his wife and three sons, make plans to break him out of prison. Along with his cellmate. So in July 1978, his three sons, Donald, Ricky and Raymond enter the State Prison where Gary is, and they bring with them a cooler, a large ice chest, filled with guns.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:00 Rhiannon: This is the late '70s, I guess you can take coolers with guns into prisons at the time.</p>
                        <p>06:06 Peter: No one's checking the cooler.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>06:08 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>06:08 Michael: The late 1970s were apparently completely indistinguishable from the 1870s, 1770s. It's just like the fucking wild west.</p>
                        <p>06:17 Rhiannon: Exactly. Yup.</p>
                        <p>06:18 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>06:18 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>06:18 Peter: In our DC v Heller case we talked about bank robberies in the '30s, how like... They were just an epidemic, right, everyone's getting away with it, and apparently it was like that with prison breaks until like 1985.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>06:30 Rhiannon: Right, right. So they have their cooler filled with guns, the Tison brothers arm their dad and the cellmate, and the whole group basically locks up the prison guards in a closet and they make a run for it. No shots are fired at the prison, no one is killed there, but their getaway plan basically blows up a few days later. That's where things get really messy. After a couple of days, they get a flat tire out in the desert and they flag down a passing motorist with the intent of stealing their car. The car that stops to help them has a family of four in it, it's a husband, a wife, their young daughter and their very young niece. After kidnapping the four people and taking them out into the desert, Gary Tison, so the dad, and his cellmate, so the two men that just escaped from prison, murder the family by gun shot.</p>
                        <p>07:21 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:22 Rhiannon: Now, the three brothers, Donald, Ricky, and Raymond Tison, they are present and they witness the murders, but they do not kill the family. They don't fire any shots.</p>
                        <p>07:31 Michael: Right. They were like getting a jug of water for them or something right?</p>
                        <p>07:34 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:34 Peter: Yeah, they were... They represented that they were getting water for the family, so pretty clear that they, at the very least, did not think that the family was going to be murdered.</p>
                        <p>07:43 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:43 Rhiannon: Right, yes. Now eventually this group is apprehended by police and there's a shoot out at that time. One of the sons, Donald, is killed at the shoot out. Gary Tison, the dad, he escapes into the desert and he eventually dies of exposure... And is exposure a real thing? Do we just say that because it's the '70s or whatever?</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>08:01 Michael: No, it's a real thing.</p>
                        <p>08:03 Peter: It's a real thing.</p>
                        <p>08:05 Michael: It's like the thing... The elements.</p>
                        <p>08:06 Rhiannon: All right. Well, I have a JD not an MD, excuse me.</p>
                        <p>08:08 Peter: Yeah, the elements, it's like... You can't...</p>
                        <p>08:09 Michael: Yeah, it's like, the desert... It's really hot during the day, and then really cold at night. Either of those are hard on the body.</p>
                        <p>08:17 Rhiannon: Okay Mr. Meteorologist.</p>
                        <p>08:18 Peter: I think that... I see what you're saying though, 'cause it's not like a specific thing, and I... My guess...</p>
                        <p>08:23 Michael: It's not like consumption. No. If that's what you're saying.</p>
                        <p>08:25 Rhiannon: That's what I was thinking of, consumption.</p>
                        <p>08:28 Michael: It's not like that, no. No. You can definitely still die of exposure.</p>
                        <p>08:34 Rhiannon: Okay. So Gary Tison dies of exposure in the middle of the desert. Gary's cellmate then, and the two remaining sons, Ricky and Raymond, are arrested. Now, the two brothers are charged under Arizona's felony murder rule, which provides that a killing that occurs during perpetuation of a robbery or a kidnapping is capital murder. So you're eligible for the death penalty for that. The State of Arizona also has an accomplice liability provision that states that each participant in a kidnapping or robbery is legally responsible for the acts of his accomplices. So in the end, this isn't just a getaway driver case, right? All of the people involved here have a higher degree of participation in the alleged offenses than sort of just waiting in a car for somebody, right? The fact of the murder are horrific, but also important to remember, I think that some of the worst rules that we get in criminal law, some of the worst trends in punishment that we have in the United States, come out of cases like this where the particular instance is particularly hard to defend.</p>
                        <p>09:43 Michael: There's like a saying for that in law, right? Like hard cases make bad law, right. If you try to make the law fit the most extreme cases, you're gonna end up with a shitty rule overall.</p>
                        <p>09:53 Rhiannon: Exactly, but I think that's all the more reason to have clear bright line standards...</p>
                        <p>09:57 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>09:58 Rhiannon: And a Supreme Court that's not so deferential to Law and Order legislators, to a public that's influenced by sensationalist media, and that kind of thing.</p>
                        <p>10:08 Michael: Absolutely. Yeah, and on top of that, very early, I think one of the first two paragraphs of the opinion, Sandra Day O'Connor, it mentions that a lot of the information they have comes from a plea allocution from the brothers.</p>
                        <p>10:21 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:22 Michael: But the plea ultimately was thrown out. And as it turns out, the brothers were willing to plea to basically life without parole, but they weren't willing to implicate their mother. And the state wanted them to implicate the mom.</p>
                        <p>10:35 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:36 Michael: Apparently she helped in the planning and procurement of the weapons and maybe at one point was supposed to find them a plane to get to Mexico.</p>
                        <p>10:44 Rhiannon: What a badass.</p>
                        <p>10:45 Peter: I'm sure she would've pulled that off.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:47 Michael: Yeah, yeah. She ultimately was tried and convicted and sentenced to I think a year of prison for her role in this, and then was released on parole I think in less than a year.</p>
                        <p>11:00 Peter: More sexism against men, but go on.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>11:02 Michael: Right, there you go.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:02 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:04 Michael: But so, the whole reason this entire case exists is literally leverage against the mom. The only reason the Supreme Court case exists, this entire body of law, is because Arizona wanted to put this woman away for longer who had nothing to do with anything after, at most, the purchase of the weapons, right?</p>
                        <p>11:25 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:26 Michael: She wasn't intimately involved in any of this, least of all the murders, but they wanted to put her in jail for a long time, and the kids wouldn't cooperate with that. They were willing to go to prison for life, but they weren't willing to put their mom away as well. And the only reason the State is seeking the death penalty here is because it's all they have above what the brothers were already willing to accept. And so here we are, litigating what's the most outside extreme case where you can put someone to death.</p>
                        <p>11:57 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:57 Rhiannon: That's a really good point.</p>
                        <p>11:58 Michael: So to give some color about the defendants here, they're 19 and 20 at the time of the crimes. Their dad is a career criminal, he was in prison for killing a prison guard in a previous prison escape attempt, which at least [chuckle] some people had speculated his wife aided and abetted in that, and slipping him a hand gun, although that is...</p>
                        <p>12:21 Rhiannon: The guy has an MO.</p>
                        <p>12:22 Michael: Right. So he's in and out of prison multiple times, the wife is very devoted to him and very religious, apparently.</p>
                        <p>12:31 Peter: I gotta say, this makes the cooler thing even crazier because this guy already broke out, killed a fucking guard, and they're like, "I guess it's just Coca-Cola in that cooler."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:45 Peter: Just a colorful anecdote about this family here. When the kids were visiting...</p>
                        <p>12:51 Rhiannon: No, let Michael do it.</p>
                        <p>12:53 Peter: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fair.</p>
                        <p>12:53 Michael: This is an important fact that I brought to this case, so. Dorothy did regularly visit her husband in prison with her children every Sunday in order to maintain not only her relationship with her husband but also the children, those two ideas were sometimes in tension because she wants the kids there, like getting to know their dad and knowing sort of an idealized version of the dad where she told them he was innocent and he's a good guy and all this too, but she also wanted to maintain their relationship, which meant that she would perform sexual favors for him. While the kids held up a newspaper so that they wouldn't have to watch their mom going down on the dad right in the middle of the prison yard, a privilege she was granted because he was apparently quite liked by the guards in the prison, some of them.</p>
                        <p>13:48 Peter: And I have to say, so those kids grew up to commit this crime, and I feel like if you had to hold a newspaper up while your mom sucked your dad's dick as a child, you're allowed to commit a couple of murders.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:06 Michael: They didn't even do that. So I think they came out all right, personally.</p>
                        <p>14:13 Peter: So to reiterate a little bit, the felony murder rule says that if person A is committing a felony and person B dies as a result, person A can be charged with their murder even if they didn't intend to kill them. And the question is not whether this rule is constitutional, but whether is sentencing someone to death under this rule is constitutional. And Rhiannon mentioned the Enmund case, where the court had previously held that you couldn't execute someone without them having an intent to kill, and despite that precedent, the court in this case holds that the Tison brothers can be executed because although they didn't plan to kill or participate in the killing, they could have anticipated the use of lethal force. And there are a few items to discuss here, but I think we need to talk initially about the absurdity of the felony murder rule itself.</p>
                        <p>15:10 Peter: The felony murder rule flips the core principles of criminal law on their head. Maybe the most foundational element of criminal law is that you prosecute criminals based on their intent, that's the difference between, for example, classic first degree and second degree murder, whether the murder is premeditated, the law is making a judgment about the morality and dangerous-ness of the person based on what they were intending to do. Felony murder does away with that entirely saying that even if you had no intent to kill someone, you can still be charged with murder because you were already being a very bad boy, and it's taking something that is literally not murder and saying, "No, we're gonna call it murder though."</p>
                        <p>15:54 Rhiannon: Yeah, right, exactly. And typically, in criminal law, you need two things to have what is legally a crime. You need mens rea, which means a state of mind and actus reus, which is the act of committing the crime. And the idea is that you don't just prosecute someone for a crime if they only thought about a crime but didn't commit it, and by the same token, you prosecute crimes more harshly if someone planned it, really meant it, that kind of thing as opposed to not meaning it and just doing something negligently or recklessly. And so here in the case of the Tison brothers, you have neither one in this case. They didn't intend for anybody to die, they didn't intend to murder anybody, and they also didn't commit the act of murdering someone.</p>
                        <p>16:37 Michael: Right, and I think there's a good comparison here, which is drunk driving, which is something where you don't intend to kill someone, maybe you understand there's a risk that once you're drunk and you get behind the wheel that you're less inhibited and you might loose control and you might hit someone and that's pretty accepted, but you're not going out thinking, "Well, now that I've tied one on, I'm gonna go fucking run someone down in my car." But you actually do the act, right, you drive the car, you hit someone, and you kill someone, and that's not considered an intentional homicide. It's considered a reckless one, under law, it's like a manslaughter basically, and treated much less seriously than felony murder, even though in neither case do you have an intent to kill, and in only one case do you have the person being tried here actually committing the act that kills someone and that's the drunk driver and they're getting off with a few years in prison.</p>
                        <p>17:44 Peter: Yeah, and maybe we're getting a little ahead of ourselves here, but perhaps that discrepancy can be explained by the types of people that find themselves at the mercy of these laws. If you look at the people who are being targeted by the legislatures by felony murder laws, it's obviously people who are involved in crimes and maybe engaged in robberies, etcetera. Drunk driving, however much more likely to be perpetrated by a judge's child, if I had to guess or by...</p>
                        <p>18:11 Michael: Justice Kavanaugh himself.</p>
                        <p>18:13 Rhiannon: Or Georgia.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:18 Michael: I'm not saying he has. I don't know. It seems possible though. He's fucking driven drunk, let's be real.</p>
                        <p>18:27 Peter: Look, I don't want to sit here and say that Brett Kavanaugh is a serial drunk driver. I can't say whether every Friday he gets shit-faced and whips around his neighborhood just ramming over mail boxes and saying, "What are you gonna do? Sue me?" I don't know what he does on Fridays.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:54 Peter: To be clear about what we're saying about people like the Tison brothers, we're not saying that there should be zero liability for something like what they did. What they did was probably aiding and abetting murder, there's a good chance. They could be charged with that. They could be charged with any of the other unbelievably numerous crimes that they committed in the process of breaking their father out of prison and jacking a car.</p>
                        <p>19:20 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:21 Peter: So, we're not suggesting that they could avoid responsibility for their actions here, we're simply saying what I think is obvious, which is they didn't commit murder. They didn't intend to kill anyone, they didn't try to kill anyone, and they didn't actually kill anyone.</p>
                        <p>19:35 Rhiannon: Right, exactly. And in Enmund, the case that came before this one, the recognition that you don't get the death penalty without intending to kill someone, that's trying to put this important proportionality principle into practice, meaning that if there's lower culpability in death, that means you should not be eligible to receive the death penalty because it's not the worst kind of murder that can happen.</p>
                        <p>20:04 Peter: Right. So the question here again, is whether this violates the Eighth Amendment and its prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. And what the court does, cruel and unusual is such a vague term that the court has tried to use it, but it's basically a different standard and thought about whether it's proportional to the crime.</p>
                        <p>20:26 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:26 Peter: And so, this inquiry is where conservatives tend to go off the rails. And in determining what is cruel and unusual or what's proportional to the crime, one of the main inquiries that they do is trying to figure out whether society finds this acceptable. That's how you know if something's cruel and unusual, and O'Connor basically surveys the state laws to see how many states allow for the execution of someone for similar felony murders. She says that a bit under half of the states would allow for execution in these more severe felony murder cases, and only 11 states that otherwise execute criminals would forbid it.</p>
                        <p>21:09 Peter: And she essentially says that, that that suggests that it's not cruel and unusual, because it shows that there are a bunch of states that would do this, and that shows that the society accepts the death penalty in the situation. And this is a very common conservative tactic in these cases where they look at the state laws and say, "Well look, lots of states do it, and if it's widely used, it can't be cruel and unusual punishment." And this argument is absurd. First of all, it's an abdication of the court's role here. The court serves as a check on the states, and its role is to determine whether the state here is violating the Constitution. So why is it functionally deferring to the states on the question of whether something is cruel and unusual punishment. Second, whether something is constitutional, can't really be a matter of how popular it is. I'm sorry.</p>
                        <p>22:00 Rhiannon: Exactly, right, right.</p>
                        <p>22:02 Peter: It just can't. And how can it be that whether a punishment is proportionate to the crime is somehow dependent upon what other states are doing, or what anyone anywhere else is doing? If you're getting drawn and cornered for stealing a DVD, does it matter that someone else is experiencing the same thing one state over?</p>
                        <p>22:25 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:25 Peter: Fuck no, of course not. We've talked before about how reactionaries weaponize history, and this is another example. They are using the past to rationalize and vindicate the injustices of the present. Yes, many states allow for execution for felony murder, but that can't possibly answer the question of whether the punishment fits the crime. And the dissent points out a couple of key things. First, the majority ignores that many states have abolished the death penalty entirely.</p>
                        <p>22:55 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:56 Peter: Second, as the dissent points out, the proper question isn't, which states allow for the death penalty in these circumstances? The proper question is whether those states actually impose it. And between 1954 and 1982, there were 362 felony murder cases, only six executions, all of which took place in 1955. So at this point, there hadn't been an execution of a felony murderer in decades. So even by the standards the court claims to adhere to, the court's wrong. Execution for felony murder is exceedingly rare and antiquated at this point in time.</p>
                        <p>23:34 Michael: And that's felony murder, period, right?</p>
                        <p>23:37 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:37 Michael: This case is doing all these fine distinctions about types of felony murder and your proximity to the physical location of the murder and all this shit, and this is just like felony murder, overall.</p>
                        <p>23:51 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, any of them, yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:54 Michael: Any of them. It's worth highlighting that they're trying to really fucking slice and dice this as narrow as possible to come up with an excuse to kill these kids.</p>
                        <p>24:04 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:04 Peter: Right. So, related to the dissentt's point, even if you're trying to measure what society deems acceptable, this is a haphazard way to do it. There are a thousand different metrics you could utilize to figure this out. It's not just which states do it. It's also not just how often it's imposed, but let's say how often prosecutors bring it? What polling shows? What experts on criminal law say? On and on and on, right? The conservative approach here is acting as if there is some sort of objective answer to the question of, does society find this acceptable? And of course, there's not. That's not a question that can be objectively answered.</p>
                        <p>24:43 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>24:44 Peter: Okay, so next, O'Connor turns to the fact that this is, as we mentioned, seemingly cutting against how criminal law treats the question of a criminal's intent. If the person doesn't intend to kill, how can they be prosecuted, let alone executed from murder? And she goes on like a morality rant about how indifference to human life is arguably just as bad as wanting someone to die.</p>
                        <p>25:12 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:14 Peter: And I gotta say, no. [laughter] It's freaking not the same. A little thought experiment here. You have to enter one of two rooms. One has a person who wants to kill you and plans to do it when you enter the room. The other has someone who is indifferent to whether or not you die.</p>
                        <p>25:34 Rhiannon: Okay.</p>
                        <p>25:35 Peter: In my mind, this is not a hard decision. [laughter] You've probably been in a room with someone who's indifferent to whether or not you die. I think we probably all have.</p>
                        <p>25:48 Rhiannon: I'm on a podcast with a couple of people right now.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:51 Michael: I was gonna say, Peter. I've been in the recording studio with Peter and that guy doesn't care about anyone.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:00 Peter: Look, I don't know, 'cause I haven't done the research on what do we do to our listeners.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:10 Peter: Look, anyone who pretends this is a hard decision is a fucking moron. Not caring about death or human suffering is obviously like the sign of a sociopath. But clearly, actively wanting it is clearly worse. What else can you say about it? It's apparent on its face and to just sort of like fucking positive, as if it's like this fascinating thought experiment that no one can possibly answer. It's just such bullshit.</p>
                        <p>26:39 Rhiannon: Yeah, clearly, indifference to somebody dying is not as bad as actively wanting somebody to die. And for death penalty jurisprudence, you can't just start muddying the waters like O'Connor is doing in this opinion. In order to reduce arbitrariness and discrimination in the death penalty, the Supreme Court has required, there'd be aggravating circumstances that make a murder particularly bad. Plus, the Supreme Court requires employing this proportionality doctrine, all in order to say that this class of people, these kinds of murders, they should not be death penalty eligible. And so, you don't have a non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory death penalty framework without clear standards. So you can't just start injecting into that framework, stuff like, "Maybe indifference is kind of like intentionality. Don't you think?" That doesn't work.</p>
                        <p>27:33 Michael: Right. And there's a little bit of a rhetorical sleight of hand here, because the majority opinion, they point to someone who tortures someone without intending to kill them, and then the person dies, or someone who opens fire into a crowded bar, not intending to kill someone, but obviously, very well, could or does kill someone, and those are kind of classic depraved heart murders. And the idea is if you have such a reckless indifference to other people's lives, that your actions cause someone else's death that even if you didn't intend it, that can still be murder.</p>
                        <p>28:09 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:09 Michael: But the important thing is that your actions...</p>
                        <p>28:12 Rhiannon: It's the act.</p>
                        <p>28:13 Michael: Still directly cause someone's death.</p>
                        <p>28:16 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>28:17 Michael: And Brennan in dissent calls this out, he's like, "Look, you don't have either here. You don't have the intent to kill, but you also don't have the act of killing someone, which is what's required in depraved heart murders." So this is just defining murder down to the point where it's indistinguishable from other crimes.</p>
                        <p>28:37 Peter: And almost imposing a sort of bystander liability.</p>
                        <p>28:41 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>28:42 Peter: The only thing that you could do in the Tison brothers shoes is try to actively stop a murder, which it's pretty clear cut in criminal law, you don't have a real affirmative obligation to go out and stop crimes because they might happen or even if they're likely to happen.</p>
                        <p>28:57 Michael: Right. You can't be held criminally liable for failing to prevent someone else from committing a crime.</p>
                        <p>29:03 Peter: Right. So O'Connor wraps up by saying, Look, the Tisons had a "High level of participation in these crimes," but that sort of varies the key point, which is, that they didn't have a high level of participation in the actual murders.</p>
                        <p>29:20 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:21 Peter: The crimes that they participated in, are separate and they can be charged with them.</p>
                        <p>29:26 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:27 Peter: She also says, "We will not attempt to precisely delineate the particular types of conduct and states of mind, warranting imposition of the death penalty here." Except, she sort of did, right?</p>
                        <p>29:38 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>29:38 Peter: She went on about how you don't need explicit intent to kill, and I think what she really means is, when it comes to what crimes you can impose the death penalty for, "Let's not rule anything out. Let's keep everything on the table." The idea that anticipation that something might occur is the same morally or even logistically as wanting it to happen and willing it to happen is bullshit on its face. If you're going 10 over the speed limit, I think you understand that you are more likely to cause a car accident than if you were obeying it, but that's not the same thing as intentionally causing an accident.</p>
                        <p>30:17 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:17 Peter: No one would even pose it that that's a possibility. It's inherently ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>30:21 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's right. So turning to the dissent, the dissent here is written by Justice William Brennan, classic, strong, liberal Justice, and the dissent is pretty good. He starts off by noting that this doctrine is a relic from eras where every felony was punishable by death. It didn't have to be murder. And he also points out that in most American states and across Europe, you cannot punish felony murder by death. He also says, like we said earlier, that in Enmund versus Florida, back in 1982, the Supreme Court held that a person couldn't be executed absent the intent to kill. And if you read Enmund, it's hard to understand how you could possibly allow the sentence of death for the Tison brothers here, and Brennan says that this is inconsistent, and the court has invented a new rule here where you don't need the intent to kill as long as you were a major participant in a felony and acted with disregard for human life.</p>
                        <p>31:19 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:19 Rhiannon: And he also points out something important, which is that while Justice O'Connor takes for granted that the Tison brothers were indifferent to the lives of the victims, there is evidence that the brothers had gone, like we mentioned, to get the family water to drink when they were murdered by their dad, and they testified to being both unable to stop the murder and also regretful that the murders happened. Now that doesn't make the Tison brothers heroes, but it does cut against the court's conclusion that they were just indifferent about it all, they didn't care, and that's really an issue for a jury.</p>
                        <p>31:56 Michael: Yeah, this is like fact finding the court is engaged in, which is the last thing the Supreme Court's supposed to be doing.</p>
                        <p>32:02 Rhiannon: Yup.</p>
                        <p>32:02 Peter: Right. I think it's important to contextualize the felony murder rule in the context of a broader criminal justice system that is simultaneously arbitrary and merciless. There is a history of legislation where the goal is to do nothing but give increasingly severe sentences to decreasingly severe offenses and felony murder has a strong place in that tradition. But you also have mandatory minimum sentences, three strike laws, things like that. There's countless examples of these types of laws. If you ask a conservative why those laws exist, they might say, to deter crime or to punish criminals, but research really shows that it doesn't deter crime. Obviously, these laws are not driven by social science, right?</p>
                        <p>32:52 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:52 Peter: And I think the only way to really understand them is being driven by pure blood lust. It's the desire to believe that they are an entirely different class of human being than the people who commit these crimes and that the weight of the system should fall upon the people who do, because they could never contextualize themselves as ever being in this sort of position.</p>
                        <p>33:11 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>33:12 Peter: And Sandra Day O'Connor is not interested in proportionality here. The defendants here didn't kill anyone, didn't try to kill anyone, seemed to regret that people have died. So how can Sandra Day O'Connor and the other conservatives say that execution is proportionate to the crime here? I think there's only one explanation that makes sense. They have decided that whether or not they intended to kill is not relevant. What's relevant is that they think that these people are bad people, and they belong to a class of people whose lives these Justices are ironically enough completely indifferent to. They just have no regard for whether or not they live. And so, they dance through a bunch of fucking hoops to find themselves in a situation where they can tell the state, "Yeah, you can kill these guys. Fuck 'em."</p>
                        <p>34:00 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:00 Michael: Yeah, I think it's like pure retributive justice here where they wanted to punish someone and the person most directly responsible died in the fucking desert. And so, they needed to punish someone else. So it's like, "Why not his fucking kids, they're right there," right?</p>
                        <p>34:16 Peter: Yes.</p>
                        <p>34:16 Michael: Right and the cellmate was executed, and eventually these kids, their death sentences were commuted.</p>
                        <p>34:25 Peter: Yeah, yeah, worth noting they don't die.</p>
                        <p>34:27 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>34:27 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:28 Peter: So look, the case here is about someone being executed for felony murder, but the real fundamental absurdity is someone being prosecuted at all for a murder that they did not in any real sense commit, and there are a bunch of examples of just how outlandish felony murder rules can get.</p>
                        <p>34:46 Rhiannon: It's an absurd rule, and in some states, you can fucking get executed for it.</p>
                        <p>34:51 Michael: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:52 Peter: The Tison case, you've got someone who is participating in a crime and obviously didn't participate in the murder itself, but they are creating a situation where there are life and death stakes, without a question.</p>
                        <p>35:05 Michael: It's not hard to understand the desire to see them punished heavily.</p>
                        <p>35:09 Peter: Yeah, but the felony murder rule itself gets applied to all sorts of situations where the death is so far detached from the actions of the felon that it becomes just hard to believe that this is actually a rule applied consistently across the American States.</p>
                        <p>35:27 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>35:28 Peter: And I think it would be useful to go through a few of those scenarios. And we wanna focus on a particular aspect of felony murder that has sort of started to crop up more and more, which is that cops will, in trying to stop a crime, kill someone, and then the perpetrator of the crime will get charged with that person's murder.</p>
                        <p>35:52 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:52 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:54 Rhiannon: So one example is a girl named Masonique Saunders in Ohio. She was arrested at the age of 16 for the death of her boyfriend Julius Tate. Now, Saunders and Tate had planned a robbery, and Tate ended up being shot by an undercover police officer, but the result was that Saunders was charged with that murder. Another case, another 16-year-old, actually, Blake Layman. He was prosecuted under the felony murder rule in Indiana after participating in a spur-of-the-moment group robbery. He and his friends in that case thought that their neighbor's house across the street was empty. They went in to grab a wallet and see if they could find anything else that they could steal and sell, but the neighbor ended up being home. The neighbor opened fire on the teenagers. Layman himself was shot. He survived. But his friend that was with him was shot and killed, and Layman got charged in the murder of his friend. He was sentenced to 55 years in prison under the felony murder rule in Indiana. And we should note that that sentence eventually got reduced and he was released.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:07 Rhiannon: Another 16-year-old in New York City this time, Marcell Dockery. He set fire to a mattress in his apartment in Brooklyn back in 2014, and an NYPD officer who responded to the fire later died of smoke inhalation.</p>
                        <p>37:25 Michael: Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>37:26 Rhiannon: Dockery is charged in murdering that police officer and was sentenced to 19 years in prison in 2017.</p>
                        <p>37:35 Peter: Obviously, that is horrific.</p>
                        <p>37:36 Michael: So fucking sneaky.</p>
                        <p>37:36 Rhiannon: It's fucking insane.</p>
                        <p>37:37 Peter: How fucking ass-backwards does a cop need to fall into his own death? [laughter] You're some shitty 16-year-old. This isn't like a fucking breaking and entering situation, right?</p>
                        <p>37:47 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>37:47 Peter: You're a 16-year-old lighting a mattress on fire. I can readily see myself doing this at 16.</p>
                        <p>37:55 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>37:57 Peter: 80% of the 16-year-old population, you see a mattress, you got matches or something, and you're gonna light that shit on fire. Some moron fucking cop manages to turn a mattress fire into his own death.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>38:11 Peter: And you get a fucking funeral with a 21 gun salute, the mayor tweets about your service, and the fucking kid gets charged with murder.</p>
                        <p>38:22 Rhiannon: It's fucking wild. Another one, last year, an NYPD detective was shot and killed by a fellow officer while responding to a robbery. Both men who committed the robbery, Christopher Ransom and Jagger Freeman were charged with the murder of that officer, even though it was another police officer who killed him. And by the way, Freeman, one of the participants in the robbery, his participation in the robbery was only as a look out, important to note that, also charged with murder.</p>
                        <p>38:54 Peter: It is so wild that cops have figured out that not only do you not get in trouble when you kill someone.</p>
                        <p>39:01 Michael: Other people do.</p>
                        <p>39:01 Peter: But you can get some other person charged with the murder, it's fucking crazy.</p>
                        <p>39:06 Rhiannon: Just to highlight the arbitrariness with once you are applying the felony murder rule, how it ends in different outcomes of case to case. So back in 2009, Robert Thompson was executed in Texas after being charged with felony murder. And what happened in his case was during a joint robbery of a convenience store, Thompson and his co-defendant Sammy Butler, they both fired shots at two employees, but it was actually Butler's bullet that ultimately killed one of the employees. Both shooters were eligible for the death penalty, but they had two separate trials and those came to two separate conclusions. Thompson is sentenced to death while Sammy Butler was not and...</p>
                        <p>39:49 Peter: The guy whose bullet actually killed him was not sentenced to death.</p>
                        <p>39:54 Rhiannon: Right. Right. Exactly. So just a highlight that when you're using arbitrary and vague rules and you don't have clear standards, this is exactly what it leads to.</p>
                        <p>40:01 Michael: Right, and Brennan kinda makes this point that's then the conclusion of his dissent, which is like, he doesn't think it's possible to create real bright line standards for the death penalty and that it's always gonna be arbitrary, and that's why the death penalty in general should be considered cruel and unusual and I think that's a pretty good example.</p>
                        <p>40:21 Peter: Right, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>40:22 Michael: But at the very least, in the felony murder context.</p>
                        <p>40:25 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>40:26 Peter: And a lot of these cases, we mentioned a lot of 16-year-olds here, there are a lot of situations where you have sort of these mass crimes where peer pressure is a huge part of it, and you have these kids getting drawn into a robbery or a fight, where someone dies and these kids who were just sort of pulled into it due to peer pressure, get charged with murder despite not being involved with it really at all, and if any part of you believes that our criminal justice system is targeting the rehabilitation of the people it prosecutes, you have to believe that people like that are the most likely to be rehabilitated, and the exact opposite approach is being taken by the system right now where they're getting charged with murder for what is basically a combination of two things, one, committing a crime and two, being in close proximity to a murder.</p>
                        <p>41:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, I think that's a really good point, Peter. And studies show that felony murder rules end up getting applied disproportionately to teenagers, and that's because of the things that we know about child psychology and development, that teenagers are more likely to be caught up in group crimes and group think that ends with unintended consequences.</p>
                        <p>41:42 Peter: And so, as we wrap up, I wanna bring up one thing, this is a death penalty case, and the question is whether the death penalty for felony murder is constitutional, but I think that there's a case to be made that felony murder as a concept is cruel and unusual punishment. It is prosecuting someone for a crime they did not commit, it is manufacturing a murder charge, it's saying that your proximity to a murder can result in you being charged with murder regardless of your intent. I think if there were a coherent Eighth Amendment, something that was really designed to target injustices in our criminal justice system, it's not crazy to think that it would forbid the rule all together, let alone the death penalty for it.</p>
                        <p>42:29 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's right. When I think about felony murder and particularly the states where it's possible to be executed for committing a felony murder, the big concern in my mind with the rule is that if we allow someone to be executed for felony murder, how much state violence logically can flow from that. And this is a point about the effects of the death penalty in general, not just felony murder, death penalty on sort of broader understandings of the relationship between state and individual, but if we accept that the state can murder someone who committed a felony without intending to kill somebody, we can accept much easier, the other ways that the state kills people, where we accept that a cop can shoot a black man in the street, and that's okay. And when the standards are unclear, when there aren't bright line rules for who gets put into death penalty eligibility, the standards end up being unclear elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>43:23 Peter: Right, it's a great point. And I think to take a step back and look at the way that conservatives view the Eighth Amendment and similar circumstances, conservatives claim that you can't have judges determining by themselves what is cruel and unusual punishment. It's too arbitrary, right? And what they do instead is replace it with a calculus that is designed to feel less arbitrary, but in fact is not. O'Connor does a survey of state laws as if that can quantifiably answer the question of whether society approves of this practice. This is one of the big themes of formalistic reasoning, pretending as if you are almost mathematically reaching objective outcomes, when in fact your reasoning is built on a foundation of completely arbitrary rules and metrics, and that's how courts take a question as simple as, should we execute people for murder if they haven't murdered anyone and distort into something needlessly unrecognizable.</p>
                        <p>44:21 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:22 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>44:26 Peter: Next week is Buck v. Bell.</p>
                        <p>44:29 Rhiannon: Hell yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:30 Peter: It is a case from the 1920s. We're going way back.</p>
                        <p>44:32 Rhiannon: Taking it way back.</p>
                        <p>44:34 Michael: Retro.</p>
                        <p>44:34 Peter: And it's about eugenics.</p>
                        <p>44:36 Rhiannon: 'Cause if you thought the Supreme Court only dabbled in racism, they also dabbled in all this shit too.</p>
                        <p>44:43 Peter: Yeah, and if you can imagine the modern court uninhibited by the last century of social progress.</p>
                        <p>44:54 Michael: A sneak preview of what the court will look like in 10 years if there are two or more conservatives.

                    <div>
                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We'll hear argument first this morning in case 11-1025 Clapper versus Amnesty International.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:08 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh, host of Fiasco and co-creator of Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about the 2013 ruling in Clapper v. Amnesty International. At issue is the federal government's ability to surveil communications between foreign suspects and their associates without showing probable cause. Supreme Court set up a Catch-22 by ruling that people who think they've been illegally surveilled, can't sue over it unless they can first prove that surveillance has taken place.</p>
                        <p>00:40 [Archival]: Don Verrilli, the Justice Department lawyer said it was a cascade of speculation when our clients said, "We think our data has been collected by the government."</p>
                        <p>00:50 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:00 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have latched on to American society like viruses onto a host cell. I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy, I'm here with Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:17 Rhiannon: Hi. Oh, I got introduced first.</p>
                        <p>01:19 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:21 Michael: Hey everybody.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:23 Peter: Yeah, I figured since me and Michael aren't sitting in the studio, you know what? I'll start mixing up the order in which I introduce you.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Peter: And I'm sure someone will run statistics on it, and it'll turn out I introduced Michael like 20% more often [chuckle] than Rhiannon and we'll get...</p>
                        <p>01:39 Rhiannon: And then we'll finally be canceled.</p>
                        <p>01:42 Peter: [chuckle] Finally.</p>
                        <p>01:45 Michael: At long last. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:47 Peter: So today we are talking about Clapper v. Amnesty International, a 2013 case about the NSA's mass surveillance of American citizens. And much has been written and said about how new technology and post-9/11 politics combined to create an environment where aggressive government surveillance programs could thrive. And what we wanna touch on today is one of the many ways in which this country's courts have failed to fulfill their role as a check against these programs. Surveillance by intelligence agencies is a tricky issue for courts in large part because those agencies operate very secretively. And this should, I think, in a rational world, result in courts being more aggressive in their demands that these agencies operate with some transparency. And the Roberts Court has taken the opposite approach, right? Offering deference to those agencies and allowing them to hide behind their own secrecy to avoid legal liability. This case holds that you can't challenge the NSA's surveillance program unless you have proof that you're under surveillance, a standard that is basically impossible to meet.</p>
                        <p>03:04 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>03:05 Peter: And the law in question is the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, that is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. And that Act authorizes the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a federal court dedicated to overseeing surveillance requests targeting foreign spies to authorize surveillance without a showing of probable cause. And so to be clear about the NSA's role versus, for example, the FBI. The NSA is the National Security Agency, and the NSA is a foreign-directed agency, meaning that they are targeting activities outside of the United States. And so these laws are allowing them to intercept the communications of foreigners, right? Or people outside the United States that might be acting against the United States. As a reminder, the Fourth Amendment protects against searches and seizures without probable cause.</p>
                        <p>04:05 Michael: Right. What this all means in plain language is this. The NSA is running surveillance on certain foreign citizens without probable cause, and that's legal, but those foreign citizens are the clients or contacts or sources of American organizations, journalists, and lawyers, including Amnesty International. So some of the communications the NSA is monitoring are between those foreign citizens and the American citizens, they have these sorts of professional relationships with. And the American citizens who are protected by the Fourth Amendment are saying, "Look, you're surveilling our communications with our clients without probable cause, and that's a violation of the Fourth Amendment."</p>
                        <p>04:56 Rhiannon: Yeah. I think the statutory background, like the reason why we have this law to begin with, is important because why we have this law is to establish some ground rules for when the government can spy on you in the first place, right? So this case, Clapper v. Amnesty International is about challenging some new provisions under FISA. Now, FISA was originally passed in 1978, and it established procedures for the surveillance and collection of foreign intelligence information between foreign powers and agents of foreign powers who were suspected of espionage or terrorism. So originally, back in the '70s, we get this law because after the Watergate scandal, it is revealed that the Nixon administration was using federal resources, including law enforcement agencies to spy on political and activist groups. So the law was created to provide judicial and congressional oversight of the government's covert surveillance activities of foreign entities and individuals in the US.</p>
                        <p>06:00 Rhiannon: But when the law was created, Congress worked with the Justice Department in kind of designing the law, and of course, the Justice Department insists that there's a necessary amount of secrecy that has to be maintained to protect national security. So the oversight mechanisms that are built into the law, those are still designed to be pretty secretive. One aspect of the kind of secret oversight mechanism is the creation of the FISA Court. So the FISA Court, it's also called FISC, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, it oversees the requests for surveillance warrants by the federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies that warrant to conduct surveillance. And the role of the court is to review the government's request for surveillance warrants and ensure that the warrant is sort of sufficiently particularized, meaning there's a specific target of the warrant and to make sure the government has minimization procedures in place that are designed to limit the scope of surveillance, so basically, the wrong people don't get accidentally surveilled.</p>
                        <p>07:05 Peter: Right. And this is basically parallel to how it's done domestically as well, but the sort of surveillance of foreign individuals and foreign entities is so specialized that there essentially needs to be a separate court for it.</p>
                        <p>07:19 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, but it's important to note how the FISA court actually operates though. It's really secretive. The court is made up of 11 judges, they're appointed by the Chief Justice, and they serve seven-year terms. Now, proceedings before the FISA court, they're ex parte, meaning it's one party in front of the judge, and proceedings are also non-adversarial. So the court is just hearing evidence presented only by the DOJ, there isn't another side kind of arguing the other side of an issue. And there's no provision in FISA in the Act for release of information from these court hearings. There's also no provision for releasing the record of information that was actually collected. And the court importantly meets in secret, and all they really do is approve or deny the request for warrants. Just to give an idea about how this actually works in practice, between 1979 and 2006, we're talking 26, 27 years, a total of 22,290 applications for warrants were made to the FISA court, and only five of those were rejected.</p>
                        <p>08:33 Michael: Wow.</p>
                        <p>08:34 Peter: And that is a whole court dedicated to that.</p>
                        <p>08:36 Rhiannon: [laughter] Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>08:37 Peter: Dedicated to rubber-stamping the fucking NSA's requests for surveillance. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:42 Michael: Are you so sure that that doesn't just speak to the rigor, thorough approach that our intelligence communities take to these applications?</p>
                        <p>08:53 Peter: Never thought of that, never thought of that. That's a good point.</p>
                        <p>08:54 Rhiannon: The NSA fills out those warrants just with incredible care and accuracy. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>09:03 Michael: They come correct when they go to FISC.</p>
                        <p>09:03 Rhiannon: [laughter] That's right.</p>
                        <p>09:05 Peter: Your honor, here's genetic proof that this guy is an Arab, your honor.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:13 Rhiannon: The NSA would be doing race science, like for sure. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>09:17 Peter: 100%.</p>
                        <p>09:18 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>09:19 Peter: 100%.</p>
                        <p>09:20 Rhiannon: So that's kind of just background how FISA and the FISC have worked since passage of the law in the late '70s. But what's at issue here is specifically like Peter said up top are amendments to FISA that were made in 2008. Now, after September 11th, the George W. Bush administration was revealed to have been conducting a massive secret warrantless wiretapping program in which private telecommunications companies like AT&T were shown to have likely been complicit, and so there was a push to expand the scope of FISA so that the government can basically keep on doing mass surveillance, but also bring it within the scope of the law, so it's like, "Don't worry, it's legal. We authorize this." And we don't know a lot about the specifics of that program, but basically, whistleblower evidence shows that perhaps millions of American's private communications were swept up in that surveillance.</p>
                        <p>10:19 Michael: Right. And the dysfunction of the "political branches" is not really the purview of our podcast, we only comment on that occasionally, but it is worth taking a moment to really savor how fucked up it is that up until the early 2000s, the FISC could basically authorize what were essentially warrants to surveil individuals communications abroad, right?</p>
                        <p>10:47 Rhiannon: Right, yes.</p>
                        <p>10:48 Michael: And then there was a big scandal about warrantless wiretapping scooping up American citizens communications and mass surveillance, and everybody agreed this was a problem, and the political response to that was to literally just empower the executive to continue doing it.</p>
                        <p>11:07 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:07 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:08 Michael: And so now it would no longer be scandalous because it's no longer illegal.</p>
                        <p>11:12 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:13 Rhiannon: So the 2008 Amendments to FISA establish basically a new source of authority for the government in collecting intelligence. First, the 2008 Amendments don't require the government to demonstrate probable cause that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. And secondly, the new part of FISA doesn't require the government to specify the nature and location of each of the particular facilities or places at which surveillance will occur. So if you're paying attention, the effect of those changes is that the government could basically conduct surveillance on a massive programmatic basis rather than on sort of individualized or particularized targets, and Americans communications are gonna get swept up in there too. And the special secret FISA Court has been given even less power to supervise the minimization procedures that the government was supposed to use.</p>
                        <p>12:11 Peter: Think about how fucking shady the NSA must have been in the early 2000s that we have a law where there were over 22,000 requests for surveillance, five are rejected, and they are trying to evade that standard, they're trying to dodge that like 0.00, whatever was that...</p>
                        <p>12:29 Rhiannon: They're like we need more. Right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>12:33 Michael: It's not enough.</p>
                        <p>12:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's fucking wild. So yeah, on the day these amendments are passed, which sort of broadens the authority and the scope of what the government is allowed to do, on the day those amendments are passed, the ACLU files this lawsuit, which becomes Clapper v. Amnesty International and the ACLU says basically like the 2008 Amendments to FISA are facially unconstitutional, and so there are several...</p>
                        <p>13:00 Peter: Under the Fourth Amendment, right?</p>
                        <p>13:00 Rhiannon: Under the Fourth Amendment, yes.</p>
                        <p>13:01 Peter: The idea is that surveillance, the capturing of the communications of American citizens, which is undoubtedly happening from time to time under this program is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. It's a search and it's done without probable cause.</p>
                        <p>13:17 Rhiannon: Yes, and so there are several plaintiffs here, they're all either lawyers or human rights advocates. There's a couple of labor organizations and also journalists, and they all say that they represent or they work with people who are the targets of US government surveillance and this new kind of really broad authorization to surveil their communications makes them, the plaintiffs, unable to do their jobs, like for example, obviously the case is named for one of the plaintiffs, Amnesty International, a massive human rights organization. Another one of the plaintiffs is Chris Hedges, he's a foreign correspondent for the New York Times, Naomi Klein, who's a columnist and author, and Sylvia Royce, for example, who was at the time representing detainees at Guantanamo.</p>
                        <p>14:05 Peter: Right. All heavy hitters, by the way. Chris Hedges, Naomi Klein. Cool as hell.</p>
                        <p>14:10 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>14:11 Peter: It's important to keep in mind here that on one side of this case is Amnesty International, a human rights organization, along with some journalists and lawyers, almost all of whom are doing important work. On the other side is the Director of National Intelligence, and in effect, the NSA itself, an organization whose primary responsibility is to monitor the wedding schedules of ostensible terrorists. And an organization which as Edwards Snowden revealed, is or has been engaged in wholesale monitoring of Americans' communications.</p>
                        <p>14:46 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>14:46 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>14:48 Peter: So Amnesty is saying that this law is unconstitutional because it effectively allows for the surveillance of citizens communications without probable cause, but the court doesn't address that issue because it first needs to address whether Amnesty and the other plaintiffs have standing. Standing, in short, is your legal right to sue. And it's based on whether you have been sufficiently harmed. So you can't, for example, just bring a legal claim purely on behalf of someone else. You can't say, "Look, Amazon violated my buddy's rights and I wanna sue." You have to show that you yourself have been harmed. It's a pretty standard principle in the law, although the boundaries of it are very vague, and so Amnesty and the other plaintiffs, they argue that they do have standing because they engage in substantial international communications, much of it's confidential. It's very likely that they're going to be surveilled under the program. The court says, "No, no, no. That's too speculative. You don't know that your communications are being intercepted and standing can't be based upon hypothetical harm."</p>
                        <p>16:03 Michael: Right. One issue in this case is just the lengths the court will go to to avoid hot button issues or here this issue in particular, which is why we're gonna end up talking about standing rather than the Fourth Amendment, because it's sort of what the court uses to throw this case out without having to rule on the merits at all.</p>
                        <p>16:30 Peter: Right, so Amnesty and the other petitioners, the other plaintiffs here, are basically saying, "Look, we communicate frequently with groups and individuals who are likely targets of this law, and because of that, we can reasonably expect that their communications are being intercepted." The court says, "No, no, no. That's just speculation." And so we're gonna get into how silly this is. It's so fucking wild. So the main thrust of the majority opinion is that in order to challenge the constitutionality of this law, you need to be almost certain that you're being monitored by the NSA, and the main response to that is, how the fuck are you supposed to know if you're being monitored by the NSA? How is it even remotely possible for your average citizen to find out that their communications are being monitored by the NSA? It's not possible. This is basically telling the NSA that if they do their dragnet surveillance secretly enough, there's really no legal recourse for someone who's being listened in on, right?</p>
                        <p>17:35 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah.</p>
                        <p>17:37 Michael: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>17:38 Peter: And maybe more pointedly, the court is claiming that Amnesty and the rest of the petitioners don't have standing, but what they're actually saying is that they don't know whether they have standing.</p>
                        <p>17:48 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:48 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:49 Michael: They might, in fact.</p>
                        <p>17:52 Peter: Only the NSA knows whether they have standing, which is sort of wild because the defendant in this lawsuit is the Director of National Intelligence. He's a party to this litigation, which means that whether or not the petitioners have standing is a question that can be answered by the other party to this case.</p>
                        <p>18:10 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>18:12 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:12 Peter: So there is a question being posed here, which is, "Why don't we just ask the NSA who is effectively a party to this case, whether or not they are monitoring the plaintiffs here? And wouldn't that solve the problem?"</p>
                        <p>18:26 Michael: And Sam Alito writing for the majority has an answer to your question, Peter.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:31 Michael: The answer might not be very persuasive, and that's because Sam Alito, I think rather than brain matter, I think his head is filled with like moldy cottage cheese.</p>
                        <p>18:41 Rhiannon: Giant dumbass.</p>
                        <p>18:43 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>18:44 Michael: That just like sort of drips out of his nose. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:45 Peter: And look, there's a three strikes you're out rule, so if we get a third Italian on the court and he's a shithead too, that's it, we're done with them. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:54 Rhiannon: No more Italians.</p>
                        <p>18:54 Michael: No more Italians. So he has two answers...</p>
                        <p>19:00 Rhiannon: One is that the technical standard is that it's the plaintiff's burden to show standing, which is just a legal way of saying, "Well, look, it's not the government's job," which strikes me as bullshit. I'm not saying that's not technically right, but you could have a whole academic argument about burden-shifting...</p>
                        <p>19:19 Peter: It's not about whether it's technically right, it's about whether this circumstance...</p>
                        <p>19:22 Michael: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>19:23 Peter: Commands a different standard. And of course it does. The fucking program is entirely secretive. Of course, you can't just say, "Well, it's your burden. So it's too bad."</p>
                        <p>19:31 Michael: Right, right. I think the government actually raised this objection. I don't think this was brought by the court, and there's a special type of bullshit for the government to be like, "I don't think you have standing" and then to be the person in charge of the information about whether or not that's true and to be like, "Well, look, we don't have to share that. Whether or not what we're alleging is correct or not, that's not really our job to answer that question."</p>
                        <p>19:54 Peter: It's fucking wild. Yeah, I mean, their whole argument is, "Look, they don't even know that they're being surveilled," and the retort in a reasonable world would be, "Well, are they?" and...</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>20:04 Rhiannon: Right. Because you know the answer... Yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:05 Peter: And they would have to answer but instead they're like, "Well, are they?" And the government's like, "That's their fucking problem, bro."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>20:12 Michael: Yeah, literally.</p>
                        <p>20:14 Rhiannon: Yeah, no, it's explicit. I watched the oral arguments, and Justice Breyer brings this up, there could be even like a secret review, an in-camera review, if the NSA is saying, these people are targets of surveillance or not, the court could review that and be able to make a determination, but the lawyer for the government is like... He says it in oral argument, he's like, "No, that information is confidential. Sorry."</p>
                        <p>20:38 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:38 Peter: Right. And Alito makes that point where he says like, "Well, look... " [chuckle] It's got so fucking obnoxious, he's like, "Well, look... " But actually, I'm too drunk for this. [laughter] Michael, do you want to do this bit?</p>
                        <p>20:50 Michael: Is this the terrorist?</p>
                        <p>20:51 Peter: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's the terrorist thing.</p>
                        <p>20:52 Michael: And so, Alito has two arguments. It's not just that the burden is on the plaintiffs, he also says, "Well, look, if we allow this sort of secret review by judges, terrorists might take advantage of this and file lawsuits to find out if they're the targets of government surveillance." And he thinks this is like some fucking argument ender and not like the stupidest shit ever put in the pages of the Supreme Court reporter. Like there are two different types of terrorists that I wanna think about, one is like fucking, like Osama bin Laden or someone, right? Openly face of the terrorist organization. Does that asshole really need to be filing a lawsuit in federal court?</p>
                        <p>21:41 Rhiannon: Yeah, he's gonna...</p>
                        <p>21:42 Peter: Right, to be like...</p>
                        <p>21:42 Michael: To find out whether he is the target of government surveillance? That's so insanely stupid that that's like a potential problem...</p>
                        <p>21:49 Peter: The idea that fucking terrorists are going to out themselves...</p>
                        <p>21:54 Michael: Right. That's the second...</p>
                        <p>21:55 Rhiannon: Or that they don't know that they're being surveilled. They're terrorists. They're working in this context.</p>
                        <p>22:00 Michael: The only terrorists for whom this might be strategically useful information, are the ones who are secretive and don't want their identities known. Maybe it would be good to know if the government knows that they're associated with Al-Qaeda or something, but if so they're not gonna fucking file a lawsuit announcing themselves. Like yes, if you're a journalist who interviews sources, you might be like, "Look, I think my communications might be caught." But fucking some mechanic in Staten Island isn't gonna be like, "Hey, my communications might get swept up in this with Al-Qaeda so let's find out if I have standing to sue." If you didn't before like you're fucking now for sure. The government will have you on their list immediately afterwards, it's like I can't...</p>
                        <p>22:54 Peter: It's so fucking stupid.</p>
                        <p>22:56 Michael: It's so stupid.</p>
                        <p>22:57 Rhiannon: It's really dumb.</p>
                        <p>22:57 Peter: Completely detached from reality. So look, the concern with this whole approach, the approach where you need to be aware of whether or not you're being surveilled by the NSA, when no human being can actually figure that out, is pretty obvious, right? It makes the NSA immune to legal challenge under the law. And clearly no one's gonna know whether they're being surveilled by the NSA, so the counter-argument that the NSA provides and that this court mindlessly accepts is this. They say, "Look, we promise that if we decide to use the information that we gather under this law against someone in a criminal proceeding, we will disclose it to that person and then they can sue." And this is insane for two reasons. First, it means that in order to sue, you must be prosecuted under the law. That essentially means that the NSA can put anyone under surveillance under the statute and they can't sue unless the NSA prosecutes them for it. That means that there is functionally no constitutional limit on how much they can monitor you as long as they don't bring charges.</p>
                        <p>24:10 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>24:12 Peter: We talked in our Terry v. Ohio episode about how you can only bring Fourth Amendment claims in the stop and frisk context after you've been caught with a weapon or drugs. There's no remedy if the cop just stops and frisks you and has temporarily robbed you of your freedom and this is conceptually similar. The court is saying that you can only sue once they find something on you and bring charges against you. If you're just being monitored day in, day out, maybe years on end, you can't do anything. There's no constitutional remedy for that.</p>
                        <p>24:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, and there's a way that the conservative Justices are treating this to take the court's concern away from that really big idea. So Ruth Bader Ginsburg during the oral argument, she brings up this point exactly. She says there's no way that anyone would ever know if they have standing because they never know for certain if they've suffered that injury. The NSA is never going to tell them you're being surveilled, and Justice Scalia has a really, really dumbass response where he's just like, "There are tons of laws. Don't we have a bunch of statutes like this where we don't know who the injured party of people would be? And that just means that this isn't the place of the court to step in, that's not how the law was written. It's not for the court to monitor." And it's just like, "What's the fucking point of the Supreme Court, dude, if not to answer these questions. The conservative argument here is taking the court out of dealing with this at all.</p>
                        <p>25:48 Michael: Right. And it's like, "I don't care how the law was written, I know how the fucking Fourth Amendment is written." Right?</p>
                        <p>25:53 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly. Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:55 Michael: And I think you have a pretty strong role under the Fourth Amendment in reviewing these laws.</p>
                        <p>26:00 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>26:00 Michael: God, fuck that guy.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:02 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>26:02 Peter: RIP. So again, the NSA is saying that they will reveal to the people that they're prosecuting, that they've been prosecuted under this statute, which will allow them to challenge the statute, and that does away with the idea that they are immune to suit. And this trust that the NSA is telling the truth when they say that they will tell the people they prosecute, that they're doing so under this law and...</p>
                        <p>26:31 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:31 Peter: Perhaps trusting one of the most secretive agencies in the Federal government, which has consistently acted as if it were above the law within the past 10, 15 years, right?</p>
                        <p>26:40 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:41 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>26:42 Peter: Is not the smartest move. And if you think I'm being dumb or a conspiratorial, you're a fucking sucker because they were lying.</p>
                        <p>26:49 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>26:50 Rhiannon: Yes. Right.</p>
                        <p>26:51 Peter: Despite making explicit assurances to the Supreme Court in this case that defendants would receive notice of surveillance, federal prosecutors have consistently refused to make such disclosures over the past several years.</p>
                        <p>27:04 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:04 Michael: Yeah, it was enough of an issue that Eric Holder had to... In 2014, I think, issue a directive being like, "No, you really have to do it, guys."</p>
                        <p>27:13 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>27:14 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:16 Michael: And there finally was this guy who got his notification that he had intelligence being used against him that was collected pursuant to these amendments. His case went all the ways through trial, he got found guilty, he challenged the constitutionality of the statute, and just now in 2020, it's being briefed for oral argument in the 10th Circuit, which means maybe, maybe by 2021 or 2022, this issue will be back before the Supreme Court, a decade later.</p>
                        <p>27:51 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>27:51 Michael: That they dodged handling this issue, and that's a decade where the NSA could do whatever the fuck they wanted.</p>
                        <p>27:57 Peter: And yeah, and Michael, remind us, what was that guy charged with again?</p>
                        <p>28:00 Michael: So Jamshid Muhtorov was found guilty of providing $300 and other support to the Islamic Jihad Union, a militant Islamic group, opposed to secular rule in Uzbekistan.</p>
                        <p>28:11 Peter: $300. Like an Amazon giftcard. Fucking...</p>
                        <p>28:15 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:15 Michael: He's slightly more generous than like a bougie wedding guest.</p>
                        <p>28:19 Peter: Right. Just like Venmoing ISIS $50.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:25 Michael: And he got 11 years for that, but six years, time served, most of that time spent during trial while they were fighting a lot in part over the constitutional issues about the use of FISA derived surveillance against him in court. So he is still in jail for another few years, don't worry, there are no more dozens of dollars going into esoteric terrorist organizations in Uzbekistan. We are all safe.</p>
                        <p>28:54 Peter: So we're talking about the untrustworthiness of the NSA. They lied to the Supreme Court here in this case, and if you're not a fucking moron, you would have known as a Supreme Court justice that the NSA was maybe not being super honest in this case. Edward Snowden, the whistle-blower gave us a glimpse into their tactics, including surveillance that involved the scanning of all communications entering or exiting the United States en masse and without a warrant. Despite the fact that these laws are supposed to target non-citizens abroad, there is very good evidence that the NSA has targeted US citizens explicitly and more holistically, the NSA, together with the CIA, comprise this vast secretive component of the National Security complex that has consistently throughout history been not just unwilling to provide information about what they do, but outright dishonest with the American government and dishonest with the American people, and whenever we do find out what they're doing, it's always some fucking horrific, amoral shit, and their defense is just some variation of like the Jack Nicholson, you need me on that wall speech in A Few Good Men, right?</p>
                        <p>30:15 Rhiannon: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>30:15 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:16 Peter: They believe they're defending America, but not American ideals and not American people, more just like America as some amorphous abstraction, some undefinable concept, and they view American principles and American people as like an obstacle in the way of them as they try to achieve their goals. And so maybe in light of what is best described as a lengthy history of ungodly abuses, maybe the court shouldn't act, like we need to be deferring to what these agencies say, maybe the court should be acting as if they are more likely than the average party to be lying to them at any given time.</p>
                        <p>30:56 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, and maybe we should have a court that's more aggressive about looking at this stuff than less so. The other thing here, and this is an issue that's highlighted by the dissent, is that whether or not the NSA is monitoring these plaintiffs is not actually speculative. The majority wants to say that the plaintiffs are just speculating about it. They don't know for sure, but it's not speculative. Several plaintiffs are lawyers for various people who were the subject of terrorism charges, either in the past or ongoing. They have clients who were detained at Guantanamo, etcetera, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is of course the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.</p>
                        <p>31:37 Peter: Right, right. So fucking Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is like public enemy number one, is in question here, and what Breyer in dissent, what he says is that the government has the "motive" and the "capacity" to be monitoring these types of individual. But what he would say if he wasn't so fucking dull is that it's ludicrous to think that the American government is not monitoring the communications of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Of course, they fucking are, right?</p>
                        <p>32:08 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>32:09 Michael: It's not fucking speculative whether the moon is gonna come out tomorrow night, right?</p>
                        <p>32:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:13 Michael: We fucking know how this shit works. We're not idiots.</p>
                        <p>32:17 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:18 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:18 Michael: Well, Alito is.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:20 Peter: Right. Imagine if it became public information that the government was not monitoring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's communications. Imagine like your boss comes in and you're like, "You guys are up on KSM, right? You guys have a wire on him." and you're like, "Oh my God. Jesus."</p>
                        <p>32:35 Rhiannon: "Oh fuck. We were supposed to do that."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:39 Rhiannon: So, yeah, like Breyer says, I mean, he does... He recognizes in his dissenting opinion that the entire point of this law is collecting Americans international communications, that's the point. And so by doing so, the government is literally doing the job that it gave itself...</p>
                        <p>33:00 Michael: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>33:01 Rhiannon: So, that's really the heart of the matter. The government is acting in this way, even though the government is trying to really obfuscate that issue. The NSA argues, and obviously the conservative Justices agree that the statute... This doesn't regulate lawyers. What the law does is it confers authority on the government to do certain things, and there needs to be a clear application of that authority for anybody to have standing to sue. That's obviously splitting hairs. The rebuttal, which is argued by the plaintiffs, is that the substantial risk, or actually the near certainty of future injury, is compelling the lawyers and the plaintiffs to act in a certain way, and the majority kind of just picks apart the semantics of this. Alito highlights journalist Chris Hedges affidavit, where he states, quote, "I have no choice but to assume that any of my international communications may be subject to government surveillance." And Alito says, "Look how speculative that is, he says he has no choice but to assume that his communications may be subject." But that is in fact what's happening and they have to comport their behavior to that incredibly realistic assumption. So, it's just stupid that there's no injury found.</p>
                        <p>34:14 Michael: Right. Alito followed that up by saying, "And you know what happens when you assume."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:19 Rhiannon: Right. Right. It's like...</p>
                        <p>34:21 Michael: You make an ass out of you...</p>
                        <p>34:23 Rhiannon: Gotcha.</p>
                        <p>34:24 Michael: And me.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:25 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:25 Michael: He attributed to Confucius.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:28 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:28 Michael: Incorrect.</p>
                        <p>34:29 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:31 Peter: So, I wanna take a step back here because a couple of things. First, this is a facial challenge to this statute, meaning that they're not challenging the government's application of this law to them. They're saying this is on its face unconstitutional because you're lowering the standard below probable cause, and probable cause is required by the fourth amendment. You barely need a plaintiff to decide whether that is true or not, and...</p>
                        <p>34:58 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Peter: It's essentially just a cumbersome technicality that there has to be a plaintiff in a lawsuit like this.</p>
                        <p>35:06 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:06 Peter: And the court could absolutely say, "Look, whether or not these plaintiffs are particularly implicated is sort of hard to discern, but this is clearly unconstitutional."</p>
                        <p>35:16 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:17 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:17 Peter: Nothing is stopping that. And the other part of that is that fucking obviously these people are implicated, obviously, the government...</p>
                        <p>35:24 Rhiannon: Yes. Right.</p>
                        <p>35:24 Peter: Is monitoring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and you should just be fucking deciding whether or not this law is constitutional. The only way to dodge this is to avoid both of those. You have to say, "Well, I don't know. Maybe they're monitoring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Maybe they're not." That's a fucking joke of a...</p>
                        <p>35:42 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:42 Peter: Fucking position to take, it's absurd.</p>
                        <p>35:43 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:44 Peter: And it's one of those things where, yes, standing is a real principle within the law, but it serves a purpose, and what purpose is it serving here other than to allow the court to dodge this fucking question, right? It's not saving anyone any money in litigation, which is really the purpose of standing, right?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:05 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:05 Peter: It's just a way for the court to dodge the fundamental question here, and the fundamental question here is whether this violates the Fourth Amendment, and the court doesn't address it. They say, "Well, don't have standing, so we don't need to." And we talked about, again, the fourth amendment in our Terry v. Ohio episode. It protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. So, let's talk about whether this might violate the Fourth Amendment, and the court doesn't talk about it, so this is just us, we're just vibing here. We're just talking. So, first, obviously, the court doesn't wanna deal with whether or not this violates the Fourth Amendment, right?</p>
                        <p>36:37 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:37 Peter: They don't want to confront whether or not this sprawling NSA surveillance complex might actually be a Fourth Amendment nightmare because...</p>
                        <p>36:47 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:47 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:47 Peter: Confronting that would be a huge political bureaucratic issue with massive implications that they don't want to tread into it.</p>
                        <p>36:57 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:58 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:58 Peter: And so they decided on standing, right? But to give you some context, the question of whether the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant in a wire tapping cases is more or less settled. It does.</p>
                        <p>37:07 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>37:08 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:08 Peter: The real question is whether it's still true where the target is foreign, and the American citizen who's protected by the Constitution is on the other side of the conversation, but they're not the target, right?</p>
                        <p>37:21 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:22 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:22 Peter: So, there are a lot of little angles here, but the bottom line to me is this. Doesn't matter if the target is foreign. If you're listening to a citizen's communication, that is clearly a search under the Fourth Amendment, and you need probable cause. Cops aren't allowed to make arrests without cause just because they're investigating a foreigner.</p>
                        <p>37:41 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:41 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:42 Peter: A cop can't walk up to you in New York City and search your fucking car or whatever and be like, "Sorry, we're investigating this terrorist in Saudi Arabia." And if the NSA says that, that makes their job too hard, I don't give a shit. Get a fucking warrant.</p>
                        <p>37:56 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:56 Peter: Sorry if the Constitution...</p>
                        <p>37:57 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:58 Peter: Got in the way of you drone striking a cafe in Yemen, 'cause some terrorist nephew goes there once a week or whatever the NSA is trying to do.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>38:10 Peter: The NSA is distinctly ghoulish and horrific, and their entire purpose is to monitor threats to the state, but that is so vague and lacking in detail that what they've actually morphed into is this massive, unfettered surveillance apparatus that is designed to target foreigners who ostensibly threaten America, but probably are much more innocence, on average, than the victims of, say, the police in America, because there are no constitutional boundaries when it comes to foreign citizens. That's why they can fucking drone strike weddings. That's why they can find a terrorist sitting at a...</p>
                        <p>39:03 Peter: In a restaurant in Bangladesh and just nuke the whole fucking place, killing 20 people and not have to worry about some constitutional challenge because the Constitution is to protect the rights of Americans, those people aren't Americans. The NSA doesn't fucking care about them, and of course, the court never reaches this issue because it decides the plaintiffs don't have standing, and I wanna talk about, as we wrap up, standing as like a general concept. Standing is supposed to be about whether someone suffered harm, you can only sue if you suffered a harm. But it is remarkable how often courts will toss a lawsuit for standing in situations where there's clearly some harm taking place, and what's happening I think as a result is that people are unable to sue for certain harms that are just a little too diffuse or hard to pinpoint, even if there's no real question in anyone's mind that there is a harm occurring.</p>
                        <p>40:02 Peter: So here you have the court shrugging, right? Even though obviously this is implicating the rights of American citizens, and they're saying, "Well, we don't know for certain, whether these plaintiffs here are being surveilled." And in other cases, you have something like pollution, where study after study shows that there's a real impact on all of our well-being, but it's often the case that no single person could sue because they can't prove with that much certainty that Exxon's emissions are impacting their health. So we all know that these sorts of emissions might be hurting us, but no individual person can trace it to themselves very directly.</p>
                        <p>40:39 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>40:40 Peter: So this doctrine gets weaponized by powerful interests who impose these very real burdens on the rest of us, and courts absolutely could, and occasionally do, allow these cases to proceed if they wanted, but standing is just one way to avoid it. And it's part of why it's so hard to challenge the less tangible and less identifiable harms caused by big corporations and the government because they're just so spread out.</p>
                        <p>41:07 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>41:07 Michael: Right. I like standing because it's an area where many of the law professors, and legal professionals that we insult a lot on this, agree with us and are legal realists and to all our law students, listeners out there, you'll find this professors who will talk about the importance of precedent and methods of constitutional interpretation, and all this shit that we say doesn't matter, when it comes to standing, they'll be like, "Look. The court, they really like... They fudge it on standing." They'll use standing to avoid questions they don't wanna answer. They will use standing as a proxy for the merits of the case, where they're sort of signaling how they would actually rule without having to come out and rule that way. Everybody, not everybody, but most, I think law professors are legal realists when it comes to standing, and the fact that they're not about everything else, well, maybe these people just aren't very good at applying pretty obvious principles more broadly, 'cause I think the lesson is that standing is not special and different from everything else.</p>
                        <p>42:14 Peter: No, right.</p>
                        <p>42:15 Michael: It's all like that. But...</p>
                        <p>42:17 Peter: Standing is one of the more obviously bullshit parts of the law.</p>
                        <p>42:21 Michael: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>42:22 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>42:23 Peter: And I want to wrap this up by making one point, which is, we've talked about the conservatives' deference to the government on national security issues before, and it doesn't get that much more egregious than this. And so the next time you hear some fucking schmuck say that true conservatism is about a small and limited government, you can maybe ask them why five of the most accomplished and sophisticated conservatives in the world allowed the largest mass surveillance apparatus in history to carry on completely unchecked.</p>
                        <p>42:54 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>42:56 Michael: Right.</p>

                        <p>00:03 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon Nayfakh, host of Fiasco and co-creator of Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about what the Supreme Court might look like if Joe Biden becomes President.</p>
                        <p>00:17 [Archival]: Mounting pressure for Joe Biden from his basement to take a page from President Trump's campaign playbook, progressives urging him to release his Supreme Court nominee shortlist.</p>
                        <p>00:27 Leon: Instead of analyzing a specific case from Supreme Court history, they're looking into the future and asking how much would the Court's ideological makeup really change under a Biden presidency?</p>
                        <p>00:39 [Archival - Biden]: Look, the Supreme Court, more than any other institution, should reflect what the country looks like.</p>
                        <p>00:43 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>00:54 Peter: Welcome to a very special episode of 5-4. We are not covering a case today, and this is the first in an ongoing series of non-case episodes. In the future, we might cover Supreme Court Justices, confirmation hearings, entire decades. And today, we're going to talk about what the Supreme Court would look like under Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee.</p>
                        <p>01:23 Rhiannon: Time out, Peter. Do you want to introduce us or...</p>
                        <p>01:27 Peter: Oh, yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Rhiannon: Peter's knocked out of the round.</p>
                        <p>01:31 Peter: I am out of sorts.</p>
                        <p>01:32 Rhiannon: Unmoored, yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:33 Peter: Alright. I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy, I'm here with Rhiannon...</p>
                        <p>01:39 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:39 Peter: And Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:41 Michael: Hi, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:42 Peter: And today, we are talking about what the Supreme Court would look like under Joe Biden. The Court has become a bit of a focal point on the left when discussing the election, in large part because Joe Biden is a particularly uninspiring candidate, and so people are just redirecting their attention to other branches of government.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:06 Peter: More specifically, Biden is a centrist whose policies are more conservative than many on the left would like, and there is discussion on the left about the merits of not voting for someone like Biden. There's some debate about just what the gap between a Biden Court and a Trump Court would look like, and we want to talk about that a little bit. It is our position that the reality of this is unavoidable. The difference between a Court under Trump and a Court under Biden is significant. We're not trying to make some sort of moral argument here for voting for Biden, we're absolutely not endorsing him.</p>
                        <p>02:44 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>02:44 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>02:46 Peter: There is meaningful discussion to be had on the left about whether and to what extent the willingness of progressives to vote for centrists has over time pushed American politics further right and made Democrats the ineffectual directionless party that they are now. There are credible sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden and we're not under any fucking circumstances going to tell someone that that can't be your line, because the Court's too important. These are all moral and political and strategic questions that we're not weighing in on at this point. But we've had some people hit us up, asking, for example, if there would be any real difference between Trump and Biden with respect to the Court, or if Biden might nominate a Neil Gorsuch type, actual question we received.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:39 Peter: Or whether there's any difference between a 7-2 majority and a 5-4 majority for the conservatives. And I'm sorry, but those questions are fucking ludicrous.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:52 Michael: They are.</p>
                        <p>03:55 Rhiannon: Yeah, and when I was thinking about why we want to do this special kind of episode, I go back to what we said in the first episode of this podcast about why we're here and why we want to do this. I think I said in that first episode that the Supreme Court is a body of nine political beings, they're not objective, they're not without bias, and then over the course of this podcast season or whatever, we cover the cases in which it's clear that ideology took part in the Supreme Court Justices' decision-making. And it's easy, I think, to throw your hands up and say, "We've lost this institution, the Supreme Court, it's inherently reactionary. It'll never represent or be responsive to the needs of the people."</p>
                        <p>04:38 Rhiannon: But I actually think what I want people to kind of take away from this, maybe, is that the right in this country made the Supreme Court this way. Like this was a coordinated political campaign, they've strongly maintained it now for a few decades, and it was conservatives in this country making the Supreme Court look like it does today, and do what it does today. And that's had a massive impact on electoral politics, on corporate political legal institutions and on the lives of all of us, of millions of people.</p>
                        <p>05:12 Rhiannon: And so I think that for me, I'm not at a place where I just accept the Supreme Court is this lost institution, but instead I'm thinking about how the left should be taking seriously the Supreme Court as a front in the political battle, just like the other branches of government are. And I made a point in the Shelby County episode, which I think was cut for time, but...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:38 Rhiannon: But I think that we on the left, sometimes we kind of circle the wagon and we brush off electoral politics as unimportant. But I think that when you see how the Supreme Court treats cases like Shelby County in cases about elections and voting, you can see that the conservative movement thinks that actually these things are extremely important. This is extremely important for the right, and they're fighting tooth and nail on it constantly, so what does that mean? I think it means that there's real power in it. I don't like Joe Biden, I don't like his policies, he is a man with like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich inside his head. But I think that what we'll talk about today is what he might do about the Supreme Court, and if that's just important information to a listener to take into account, I just think it's information that should be considered.</p>
                        <p>06:27 Michael: Right, and you know, we wouldn't have much of a show if the Supreme Court didn't matter, like these decisions are infuriating because they impact people's lives, they impact our country, they shape what is possible. It's a powerful institution, and you can't make progress unless you take control of it. And one of the ways the right wing has been able to control the Supreme Court and effectively use it as a lever of power is by treating it like it's on the ballot, every single election, and not just the Supreme Court, but all the federal courts, because they're lifetime positions. And so it is on the ballot every election, with all the caveats that Peter mentioned up top.</p>
                        <p>07:15 Rhiannon: And the peanut butter and jelly thing.</p>
                        <p>07:16 Michael: And the peanut butter and jelly... Don't want to forget about that. It's not just that the conservative movement treats courts like they're on the ballot, they have an entire institution, a separate political machine that they've built over the course of our entire lives for years back into the early '80s that does nothing but recruit, train and install party loyalists in important judicial positions. And we're going to talk a little bit about that, but it's important to note up top, not just that this exists and that there needs to be a left answer to that and there currently is not, but that should impact how you think about judicial nominations, because whatever Biden's drawbacks may be, he's not fucking pulling anybody from that political apparatus, which is where all the Republican judges come from, is from the Federalist Society and from that machine and they're fucking ghouls.</p>
                        <p>08:16 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>08:17 Peter: So I think the first thing we need to talk about is what the Court looks like now, and what it might realistically look like, or what kind of opportunities for change or areas for change there are going to be over the next few years, and what that really boils down to is who's going to die? Who's going to die?</p>
                        <p>08:37 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:38 Peter: And the natural first step here is RBG. Ginsburg is 87 years old, and I don't want to hear shit about her fucking workout routine, this woman is staring death in the eyes, okay.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:57 Peter: Every day she wakes up and the grim reaper is the first thing she sees.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:04 Peter: When she didn't retire in what, 2013, which would have been... She would have been fucking 80 years old and had a great opportunity to retire under a Democratic President, there was a spate of articles about her workout, there's a workout book, all these like things that seem to like lionize her physical fitness. If you have ever seen this woman, you immediately know that it's a lie, like she's working out, and if she stops, she will immediately die.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:35 Michael: It's like a shark that has to keep swimming or whatever...</p>
                        <p>09:37 Peter: Right. People are like, oh... People are like, "Oh, she can plank longer than you can," and first of all, she can't. I looked this up and she can plank for 30 seconds. And people are like, wow, that's incredible. If you're listening to this podcast and you don't have a very debilitating disability, give planking three tries and you'll get to 30 seconds.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:02 Peter: Second of all, I don't even know that she's using any core strength, I think it's maybe just like early onset rigor mortis.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:11 Rhiannon: I've told you guys that I watched, I went to the Supreme Court, I watched oral argument in Whole Woman's Health, so this would have been spring 2016, and it's an abortion case, everybody's like, "Woo, woo, woo, what's the notorious RBG, like we're going to finally see her in action." Bitch, you can't see her, because she's fucking crumbling in on herself.</p>
                        <p>10:31 Peter: She's got that hunch. She's got that hunch.</p>
                        <p>10:32 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>10:33 Rhiannon: She is so tiny, you cannot see her from the audience, and then when she speaks, it's like a 1000-year-old witch is speaking to you from above and her voice just sort of rains down on you and it's fucking terrifying. That's her power. She's a terrifying old woman right now.</p>
                        <p>10:50 Peter: Yeah, and I think all this to say, due respect to her jurisprudence, RBG is a lock to die in the next four years.</p>
                        <p>11:01 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>11:02 Peter: A guarantee. Everyone else is up in the air to some degree, but RBG, there's no standard deviation you need to worry about, she's dead.</p>
                        <p>11:11 Rhiannon: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>11:14 Peter: So you've got Justice Breyer, 81 years old.</p>
                        <p>11:19 Michael: Also a liberal.</p>
                        <p>11:20 Peter: Also a liberal.</p>
                        <p>11:21 Michael: Not our favorite, but a liberal.</p>
                        <p>11:23 Peter: Yeah, not the most reliable, especially in criminal cases, but a liberal, for sure, one of the four. Four years at 81, oof, that's quite a distance to... You don't want to have to look at four years or four-and-a-half years when you're 81 years old and think, I gotta survive that. And now we get to the young guns on the Supreme Court, and we've got some conservatives. Alito and Thomas are 70 and 71 respectively. Roberts and Sotomayor, both 65, Kagan's like 60. No need to even worry about her, same with Kavanaugh and Gorsuch are like in their early 50s, right.</p>
                        <p>12:07 Michael: Mm-hmm.</p>
                        <p>12:07 Peter: You can pretty much ignore them in terms of this election. The real risks are RBG and Breyer, and I think Thomas a little bit, right?</p>
                        <p>12:15 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>12:15 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>12:16 Peter: I think that Thomas, he's been on the Court for nearly 30 years now, he's only 71, but at the same time, he looks like shit. I think.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:29 Peter: He's one of those guys that just doesn't look like they're moving a lot. He's just kind of sitting there. His diet consists of overstock from Jenny Thomas's various multi-level marketing schemes. She's got essential oils blasting all over the house with diffusers, and he's just sucking that in every day.</p>
                        <p>12:50 Rhiannon: Not to mention his open disdain for the job, he doesn't want to do it.</p>
                        <p>12:54 Peter: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. He might prefer to die.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:57 Peter: And that's a factor. All that to say, it's not crazy to think that if Joe Biden got into office, that he could replace a conservative Justice.</p>
                        <p>13:09 Michael: I just want to say, I'm still holding out hope that we might have a well-timed Supreme Court COVID, like a Corona illness in January of next year.</p>
                        <p>13:20 Rhiannon: It could happen.</p>
                        <p>13:20 Michael: When there's a new winter flare-up...</p>
                        <p>13:22 Peter: Yeah, maybe the COVID tail smacks the Court. That'd be nice. FBI, ignore.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>13:32 Peter: I think the other side of the Thomas thing, and then getting to the point that Rhi made about how sick he is of the job, I think if Trump is re-elected, there's a very good shot that Thomas retires.</p>
                        <p>13:41 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>13:42 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>13:43 Peter: With the sort of belief that he'd be replaced by a conservative Justice who he largely agrees with. And we mentioned this up top, but the difference between a 5-4 Court and a 7-2 Court, if two liberals drop, is basically a difference between five to 10 years of conservative dominance and 25 to 30. It means never winning a marginal decision, it means never getting the occasional win because you get one conservative who switches sides, and it also means... And this is important that the median vote shifts to the right, so what are now 6-3, 7-2, even 8-1 votes might attract another couple of votes, and suddenly those minority Justices are either A, in the majority or B, in a position where they can pitch to the remaining Justices and maybe get a couple more and start taking some of these really wildly fringe conservative positions into a place where they're more viable.</p>
                        <p>14:41 Michael: Right, and the other thing is when you've got a 7-2 Court and, like Peter's saying, the median vote changes, that doesn't just happen in a vacuum, cases don't just appear before the Supreme Court, there are conservative advocacy groups that make a point of bringing certain cases to make certain legal arguments and to ultimately make big changes in the law. And if you have six or seven conservatives on the Court, that changes the types of challenges you're willing to make, the types of risks you're willing to take, you'll be bolder. They'll be more aggressive than they would when it's 5-4 and they risk losing. All it takes is one Justice to think that it's a bridge too far and it's years of work down the drain. So...</p>
                        <p>15:28 Rhiannon: That's a really good point.</p>
                        <p>15:30 Peter: Yeah, and on the reverse side of this, on the more optimistic side of this, really not crazy to think that like Biden wins, replaces two liberal Justices and maybe a conservative, and you see the first liberal majority in decades.</p>
                        <p>15:49 Michael: Since the '60s, basically, right?</p>
                        <p>15:51 Peter: Yeah, yeah. I don't think it's very likely. Thomas would basically have to die in his mid-70s, but it's interesting to think about, and it's also just depressing how close we got if Hillary Clinton hadn't run the fucking worst campaign of all time to a considerable liberal majority. But yeah, again, it really is there as a legitimate possibility over the course of the next five years. But we have to add a couple of wild cards to this. First, Mitch McConnell. And this is the big caveat. There is a real chance that if the GOP retains the Senate, McConnell is just like, "Fuck it," and they never allow another Democratic Supreme Court Justice as long as they can stop it.</p>
                        <p>16:35 Peter: I don't know how likely it is, there's a real political calculus there, but I think given how little blow back there was for them for Gorsuch, it seems like there's a really good chance that they just do this indefinitely. It's just a matter of what they view the consequences as being, there's no question that Mitch McConnell doesn't have some sort of moral objection to doing it, right. So I think that that's really on the table, and we need to put that asterisk up there up top, you can't just talk about Joe Biden appointing a Supreme Court nominee. There are other factors involved here. In the case, though, that McConnell holds the Court hostage and Biden doesn't get to make any appointments, that's probably still better longer term than just Trump making immediate appointments, right.</p>
                        <p>17:23 Peter: I mean, there's pretty much no question, I think the short-term implications might be minimal, but longer term, you open up a lot of possibilities, possibilities that the next election is won by a Democrat and they can't hold the courts hostage any longer. Things like that, that make it sort of a clearly better scenario than just Trump having the Court.</p>
                        <p>17:44 Michael: Right, when we say the Court's on the ballot, that also means that the fucking Senate race in Montana matters, right. Colorado matters and Maine and all those contested seats, they all matter for this as well.</p>
                        <p>17:58 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:00 Peter: And there's another caveat and another wild card, which is, does Joe Biden remember what the Supreme Court is?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:08 Peter: I feel like that's a big one.</p>
                        <p>18:09 Rhiannon: Open question.</p>
                        <p>18:11 Peter: And Joe, if you're listening... You're listening to a podcast, Joe. You are safe. You're going to be fine.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:22 Michael: Joe, if you're listening and you're confused about what you're hearing, this is God speaking to you. You need to eliminate the filibuster, expand the Supreme Court, and then nominate your good friends, the hosts of 5-4.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:41 Peter: Hell, no. I don't care if the fate of the country relies upon it, I don't want to have to do a job of any sort, I shouldn't have... It seemed like I was going to qualify that. Alright, so let's get into some details about who Joe might nominate. And the best way to look at that, I think, is by kind of working our way through his history. I think all of us were sort of surprised going through his history, how sort of effective he seems to have been against conservative Justices, in a lot of ways, at least. He was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for a big chunk of his tenure as Senator, and he was the Chair of it from '87 through '95. That committee holds hearings on and investigates nominations to the Supreme Court. And so I want to kinda run through his votes, and we should note here that Supreme Court nominations weren't really contentious at all until about the mid-80s, when they started being contentious, and then it sort of ratcheted up to the current day, where every single one is sort of a battle.</p>
                        <p>19:43 Peter: In '81, he voted yes on Sandra Day O'Connor, who I think it was a unanimous vote for yes. In '86 he voted no on Rehnquist as the Chief Justice. Rehnquist had originally been nominated to the Court in the early '70s, and was appointed as an Associate Justice, Reagan nominates him to be the Chief Justice. The reason that it was sort of contentious is that Rehnquist apparently tried to convince Justice Jackson in the early '50s to oppose Brown v. The Board of Education to side with the segregationists, and he claimed that it was just sort of an intellectual exercise when he was testifying to the Committee in what was almost certainly perjury. And that was one of the first modern era fights over a Supreme Court Justice. Biden opposes him in '86, votes yes for Scalia, a 98 to 0 vote in 1986, which, while a mistake in retrospect, it was uncontroversial in large part because it was considered a big deal to get an Italian-American on the Court. Not a joke, not a joke.</p>
                        <p>20:51 Peter: In '87, he opposes Robert Bork, maybe the nomination that led us to where we are in terms of how aggressive the fights can be over Supreme Court appointments.</p>
                        <p>21:03 Michael: Yeah, yeah, for our listeners who don't know, Robert Bork is just a fucking huge piece of shit, he's real garbage. In the mid-90s after his nomination had died and all that, he wrote a book called Slouching Towards Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline. That's the type of guy that they were trying to put on the fucking Supreme Court. He's also been very, very influential in anti-trust law, which is all about how we handle monopolies or prevent monopolies, and I don't know if anybody has taken a peek out their window and noticed what the weather is like in terms of American capitalism and monopolies, but I don't think his theories of law have panned out too well.</p>
                        <p>21:53 Michael: So it wasn't just that Biden voted no, he played an instrumental role in killing Bork's domination, he helped recruit a few Republicans to make the no vote bipartisan, and just publicly grilled Bork on the right to privacy, which obviously is what underlies women's right to choose, have an abortion. In Supreme Court history that right goes back to a case called Griswold v. Connecticut, which was about regulating contraception and preventing people from getting contraception, and it was about married families having autonomy in the privacy of their bedroom. And Biden just grills Bork on this, and if you watch it... If you don't really know what's going on, it can be a little confusing, but if you know even a little, it's pretty clear that Biden's just trying to get Bork to come out and say women shouldn't have these rights.</p>
                        <p>22:48 Michael: And Bork is just like fucking dodging him, saying like look, yeah, I've openly criticized Griswold and by extension Roe v. Wade, but I've criticized the reasoning the Court used to get to these decisions. I'm not saying that necessarily the right does or does not exist, and that some point Biden calls him on it. He's like, look, you've been a law professor for a long time. You've been talking about this for a long time. Are you really telling me you've seen nothing in the Constitution one way or another to make this call?</p>
                        <p>23:20 Joe Biden: You're one of the most well-read and scholarly people to come before this Committee in all your short life. Have you come up with any other way to protect a married couple under the Constitution against an action by a government telling them what they can or cannot do about birth control in their bedroom? Is there any constitutional right anywhere in the Constitution?</p>
                        <p>23:43 Robert Bork: I have never engaged in that exercise. I have passed on. What I was doing was criticizing a doctrine the Supreme Court was creating, which was capable of being applied in unknown ways in the future.</p>
                        <p>23:55 Michael: This basically like killed Bork's nomination, being sort of exposed and clearly obviously just trying to avoid saying what was blatantly true. It ended it, which is good, 'cause he got replaced with fucking Kennedy who, for all his faults, and we've talked about him being an idiot, is much better than Robert Bork, and especially on both abortion and on gay rights.</p>
                        <p>24:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, you don't get the gay marriage decision from Bork. You don't get Bork riding for the majority there.</p>
                        <p>24:26 Peter: Yeah, I mean, gay marriage is illegal in this country, in many states without this happening.</p>
                        <p>24:31 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:32 Peter: Alright, so Joe Biden votes no on Bork, he's instrumental in knocking Bork down. In Bork's place comes Anthony Kennedy, he votes yes on Kennedy, who was confirmed 97 to 0. He votes for Souter, Justice Souter, who ends up being a liberal, by the way, although he was a George Bush Senior nominee. Souter gets confirmed and then Clarence Thomas. Biden votes no on Thomas, but asterisk. He leads the hearings in his role as head of the Committee, and essentially just lets Republican Senators openly smear Anita Hill, who had accused, very credibly, in my view, Clarence Thomas of sexually harassing her at the EEOC. Biden voted no on Thomas, whatever. I think at the end of the day, his actions probably didn't have an effect on the outcome of Thomas's confirmation, just because things had sort of crystallized along party lines already at that point, but his actions at that hearing, nothing short of disgraceful, just a gross moral failure, really disgusting stuff.</p>
                        <p>25:43 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>25:46 Peter: So 2005, Biden votes no on Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
                        <p>25:52 Michael: Balls and strikes, Mr. Balls and Strikes.</p>
                        <p>25:54 Rhiannon: Yes, the umpire himself.</p>
                        <p>25:56 Peter: The umpire himself. The vote was 78-22, so there was some real Democratic opposition, but it wasn't a contentious one, I don't think anyone really thought that he would lose. Same year he votes no on Samuel Alito, the current sort of resident weirdo on the Court, I think.</p>
                        <p>26:14 Rhiannon: Resident dumbass.</p>
                        <p>26:17 Peter: After I think it's 2007, Biden's no longer a Senator, but he made statements opposing Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, and I think the bottom line here is you've got some real genuine dark spots in how we handle this stuff. His actual votes have been surprisingly strong, it's hard to imagine someone being much stronger, frankly. He's opposed just about every Republican nominee in the past 30 and change years, every Republican nominee since Souter. My guess is a big part of this is he's just sort of a party first guy.</p>
                        <p>26:49 Peter: I think he's also been a hard-liner on Roe v. Wade, frankly, I think that's a big part for him. And, of course, it's probably worth noting, Biden's in the White House when Obama nominates Sotomayor and Kagan. Kagan, very sharp, I think maybe the sharpest member of the Court.</p>
                        <p>27:08 Michael: Good writer.</p>
                        <p>27:08 Peter: Great writer. Reliable liberal left vote on the big issues, but she can be wishy-washy, strong tendencies towards formalistic reasoning, for sure. Sotomayor may be in pure jurisprudential terms the strongest Supreme Court Justice in history.</p>
                        <p>27:24 Michael: She's my favorite.</p>
                        <p>27:25 Rhiannon: Yeah, she's great.</p>
                        <p>27:27 Peter: And I think we can mostly ignore Merrick Garland in this conversation. He was a pathetic and embarrassing attempt by Obama to nominate someone who the Republicans would approve. But I do want to note that I am a little bit haunted by the prospect that Biden would nominate Garland to like fulfill Obama's legacy. He was once asked about it and said that he was open to it, probably a meaningless statement, someone's like, are you open to doing this? And he's like, yeah, sure. But yeah, if he did that, I cannot tell you how much it would just fucking flip my brain on its ass. I'm no longer doing the podcast, I'm going full Che Guevara if he does that shit.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:14 Michael: Yeah, the one thing that gives me some confidence is his pledge, right. He has publicly stated and reiterated that he would nominate the first black woman to sit on the Supreme Court, which I mean, it's a very Joe Biden thing to say, to make that sort of campaign pledge. But...</p>
                        <p>28:37 Peter: Like it's completely separate from ideology, right? You know what I'm going to do? You ever seen a black lady up there? Yeah, you're gonna.</p>
                        <p>28:42 Michael: Yeah, I don't know if you guys saw this, but Jonathan Turley, the biggest fucking hack law professor, wrote an article criticizing Biden about this pledge, calling it affirmative action and being like the Supreme Court...</p>
                        <p>28:56 Peter: Hell, yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:57 Rhiannon: Oh, my God.</p>
                        <p>28:58 Michael: Affirmative action, unconstitutional and blah blah blah, all this shit. And one of his arguments about why this is like a bad pledge is because there are not many black women judges, and so I think about how narrow the pool is he has to choose from.</p>
                        <p>29:13 Peter: How many beautiful and brilliant white men are you passing up on?</p>
                        <p>29:15 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:16 Peter: That's the real argument, right, Jonathan Turley, fucking full grown adult putting on floaties before he goes in a kiddie pool.</p>
                        <p>29:29 Michael: In any event, there's a clear favorite here, which is Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is an Obama nominee, she's 49, which makes her a great Supreme Court age, old enough to have history and experience, but young enough that she'll be on the Court for 30-plus years. She's in the DC District Court, which is not quite as prestigious as the DC Circuit Court, but still is right there at the heart of the most prestigious area of federal law.</p>
                        <p>30:01 Rhiannon: Definitely.</p>
                        <p>30:01 Michael: You know, she was fully vetted by the Obama administration already, she was only one of five people to interview for this spot that ultimately Merrick Garland got. She's really smart. She's like the classic Supreme Court pedigree, a Harvard Harvard grad, magna cum laude undergrad, cum laude at Harvard Law School, clerked for Breyer at the Supreme Court. Twice received unanimous Senate approval both for the Sentencing Commission and then for her District Court spot. And in something that would make the left a little happy, she has two years as a Federal Public Defender.</p>
                        <p>30:39 Rhiannon: Represent, hello.</p>
                        <p>30:42 Michael: To the extent there'd be any formal knock on her experience, it would be that she didn't have a appellate experience as a judge, but she did work in appellate work, both in private practice and as a federal defender, so...</p>
                        <p>30:54 Peter: Oh, so they're going to like find the worst person she defended as a public defender.</p>
                        <p>30:58 Rhiannon: Oh, right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>31:01 Michael: Oh, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>31:01 Peter: They're going to go nuts.</p>
                        <p>31:02 Michael: But this is someone that I think if Democrats have 50 votes in the Senate, they'll get 50 and the VP and it'll be fucking awesome. The idea of her as a Supreme Court Justice gives me a little hope for the future, the tiniest, tiniest little bit of hope, but there's a little bit.</p>
                        <p>31:19 Peter: Yeah, even like just fantasizing about this sort of stuff, where it's just like, maybe, you know. But again, she's gotta be top of the list if Biden's promising a black woman.</p>
                        <p>31:27 Rhiannon: For sure.</p>
                        <p>31:29 Michael: And he's already interviewed and fully vetted this person, like that's... It feels like she's gotta be there. There have been a number of names thrown about. Of them, the few that seem most plausible to me are Sherrilyn Ifill from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and this California Supreme Court Justice, Leondra Kruger, who's pretty young, but she clerked for Stevens at the Supreme Court in the past, and clearly she's at the highest court in one of the biggest states. It's something that we said that the promise is stupid, but looking at the available candidates is actually heartening.</p>
                        <p>32:06 Peter: Yeah, it's quite interesting and good that he said he would nominate a black woman, only because there are so few options realistically that we can actually look at them and evaluate them in advance.</p>
                        <p>32:19 Michael: Well, it would be cool.</p>
                        <p>32:21 Peter: It's a good-looking field, frankly. Yeah, of course, he'll probably just do fucking the Condoleezza Rice.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:32 Peter: So I think one general point to keep in mind is that, unlike in other policy areas, there isn't a large amount of distance between the left and more centrist Democrats on Supreme Court nominations, I think historically, and realistically looking forward. And that's not to say that there's no gap, but you have a fairly small pool of potential nominees to draw from, and a lot of center-left judges are falling on largely the correct side of things, even if you're farther left than them, and as a result, I don't think it's very realistic to expect that someone like Bernie Sanders would nominate a Justice substantially to the left of Sotomayor, for example. I don't think that a nominee like that really exists.</p>
                        <p>33:18 Peter: What he would likely do is avoid picking someone like Kagan, who's on the right side of things 98% of the time, but is again, just a little too formalistic, a little too friendly with certain establishment interests, but for the most part, the distance, this isn't something like healthcare policy, where the gap between the left and the center left is enormous, right? It's just a lot tighter for a lot of almost logistical reasons, I think. There isn't a real big left legal movement to draw from, and also it's... A lot of Supreme Court decisions are binary. Are you on this side, are you on that side? And a lot of the more center-left nominees are going to end up on the correct side, even if we think they could push it farther.</p>
                        <p>34:06 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And when we say that the Supreme Court is on the ballot realistically, we also mean that the lower courts are on the ballot too. The entire federal judiciary, so the system of federal appellate courts and district courts, and that's actually where the vast majority of law is made, right, so really consequential decisions that will shape millions of lives in the aggregate, those cases and that law is being created without any Supreme Court review. Just to get an idea, in federal district court, every year, there are about 300,000 cases.</p>
                        <p>34:44 Rhiannon: Now, if you go up to the federal circuit courts, the appellate courts, those have 50,000 cases, and in fact, Justice Sotomayor, when she was a federal circuit court judge, she says, famously, that the appellate courts, the federal circuit courts, that's where the law is really made in this country. So compare that, hundreds of thousands of cases at the district court level every year, 50,000 circuit court cases each year, compared with 70, just 70, Supreme Court opinions each year.</p>
                        <p>35:15 Michael: Literally dozens. Dozens of...</p>
                        <p>35:18 Rhiannon: Right, so a huge impact on the law and therefore on people and our daily lives are happening actually at the lower court level, so we kinda have to think about how that's working too.</p>
                        <p>35:29 Michael: Yeah, my personal experience, I only briefly worked for a judge for a few months, but I got to speak directly with them about the decision-making process, and I can say with confidence that they don't care about the possibility of being overturned or anything like that. Generally speaking, they'll try to follow the law, but they do what they think is right and fuck it, the vast majority of stuff that they do can't even be reviewed, or if it does, it's going to happen down the road when that ship has already sailed in a sense, right? And then, like Rhiannon said, on top of that, the next level up is where the big binding decisions get made anyway. That's where all the big picture law gets decided is at the circuit level.</p>
                        <p>36:16 Peter: And if you think that federal judges are constrained by the Supreme Court in some real way, maybe an instructive read would be that psychotic decision out of Kentucky concerning a stay-at-home order that may have restricted church attendance or church gatherings. A judge absolutely fucking went off about how an order saying that church gatherings that can only occur with people in their cars was a violation of the First Amendment, fucking quoting like the Bible and shit in his decision. True psycho shit, misrepresenting the facts in a way that is just so deep and complete that it's not even worth bothering with what he was saying, but these people wield real power, they feel righteous and they are absolutely willing to flex that muscle.</p>
                        <p>37:09 Rhiannon: Yes. That's absolutely right. Look, I live in Texas, my access to abortion care over the next 10 years, these choices about who is taking the bench in the Fifth Circuit, that kind of stuff, it matters a whole fucking lot. So talking about what President Trump, how he has influenced the federal bench so far, currently 25% of the judges active on the federal bench are Trump appointees, so the right Republicans are taking judges and judicial nominations very seriously. And it must be because it's fucking hugely important, and even before Trump, the numbers were clear on this.</p>
                        <p>37:51 Rhiannon: So in the final two years, for example, in the final two years of the Obama presidency, Republicans controlled the Senate and Obama successfully appointed only two federal appellate judges. One of those judges, Stoll, was confirmed to a really highly specialized court that only deals with patent law. By contrast, 10 such judges were confirmed during the same period in the George W. Bush presidency, even though that was during a period when Democrats controlled the Senate, So it's clear that the Republicans take this process really seriously and are going to be sort of staunchly fighting on it. Trump said on the campaign trail, he did an interview with Breitbart Radio, that all of his judicial nominations are going to be chosen by the Federalist Society, and so that brings us...</p>
                        <p>38:47 Peter: It's so fucking wild to see someone like Trump even talking about the Federal Society. How much fucking power do these people have that this guy, who obviously has no idea what they are or what they stand for, is out there, like, yeah, whatever they say, I'll do it.</p>
                        <p>39:00 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly, just giving them a blank check almost for packing the federal judiciary with their cronies, So that kind of brings me to thinking about two things. One is what does a really conservative federal bench look like at the lower courts, the district courts, and the appellate courts, and then also, who the fuck is the Federalist Society? So a couple of cases that have happened in the past year. Last year, the Fifth Circuit held that the police are immune from lawsuit when they pick up a mentally disabled homeless man who had recently been released from a state mental health facility, the police drove that man to the county line, so that he would be out of their jurisdiction, they dropped him off on the side of the highway at night time. That man was shortly thereafter hit by a motorist and killed, and in a split court decision, with the deciding vote cast by Judge Don Willett, a Trump appointee, they held that the police are not liable for their behavior.</p>
                        <p>40:05 Peter: He wrote that opinion with one eye on the fucking LSU game on TV, fucking freaks.</p>
                        <p>40:10 Rhiannon: And just last month, March 2020, in an Eleventh Circuit decision, another Trump judge, Kevin Newsom, he sides with the prison in a case of an incarcerated trans woman who challenged the prison's refusal to provide her with medically necessary gender-affirming healthcare. So these Trump nominees to the bench have a real effect on real people's lives and the law that affects all of us every single day. Now, where are these judges coming from? They're coming from the fucking Federalist Society. We've mentioned the Federalist Society before.</p>
                        <p>40:49 Peter: Yeah, I want to explain why we're going to dive in to the Federalist Society a bit more here, and it's because if Trump is re-elected, these are the people who have almost direct control over who gets nominated to federal court positions in this country. When you're talking about who controls the courts, right, obviously the President can nominate, and when you have a Republican in office, the standard move is to simply defer to the Federalist Society, and Trump's going to be even more deferential, and has been even more deferential than your average president, because he has zero interest in doing any evaluation himself, obviously.</p>
                        <p>41:28 Peter: So what we're talking about here is the other side, what the court will look like if Trump maintains control. I think that's important to get into, because when you're talking about someone like Biden, obviously you are talking about the lesser of two evils, but it is worth noting just how grossly evil the other side happens to be with respect to the courts.</p>
                        <p>41:54 Rhiannon: Yeah, if you went to law school or you're in law school, you know who the Federalist Society is, they have Chick-fil-A at their events on law school campuses.</p>
                        <p>42:04 Peter: Only because it's illegal to serve the flesh of minorities.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:12 Rhiannon: If you didn't go to law school, you're smarter than all of us, so good job. But the Federalist Society is like the College Republicans, but for lawyers, and the student chapters, they host meetings and debates on conservative legal issues. I checked the Federalist Society website today, and some of the banner headlines that are kind of like swiping through the top of the website, one of them is a historical perspective on state power and civil liberties during COVID, and another one, there was a...</p>
                        <p>42:47 Peter: Fucking losers.</p>
                        <p>42:49 Rhiannon: Yeah. And the other one was a policy paper titled Do Voter ID Requirements Safeguard the Election Process?</p>
                        <p>42:58 Michael: Of course they'll have voter ID.</p>
                        <p>43:00 Peter: These fucking kids wear suits to go vote.</p>
                        <p>43:03 Rhiannon: Yes, yes. That's right.</p>
                        <p>43:03 Peter: The worst type of person.</p>
                        <p>43:05 Rhiannon: Yeah, nationally, the Federalist Society enjoys really massive political influence because their membership is huge, and judges like to be members of totally heinous organizations that call themselves apolitical. All five conservative Justices on the Supreme Court right now are current or former members of the Federalist Society.</p>
                        <p>43:24 Peter: I mean, it's important to remember this isn't a student organization, this is a massive organization with deep roots in government power that has a student outreach branch. But the Republican presidents speak at their events. They are an institution designed from the bottom up to control an entire branch of government to the best of their ability.</p>
                        <p>43:48 Rhiannon: Absolutely, and they are intentional and strategic and they're resourceful, right, so a former Federalist Society Executive Vice President says he endorses the network theory of society, saying it's less about who gets... It's less about...</p>
                        <p>44:05 Peter: I don't know what it is yet, but I'm upset already.</p>
                        <p>44:07 Michael: I don't like it.</p>
                        <p>44:09 Rhiannon: It sounds fucking awful. It's less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating, self-sustaining and self-driving. They not only network in their events with judges, they network like horny adolescents online, but they also have what's been called a supply and demand relationship between the judges and the network. So the Federalist Society has recognized early on, and before I think the Democratic Party or any sort of left reaction could build strength, they recognized early on that judges, conservative judges, are going to need scholarship and arguments that extend Federalist Society principles into new areas.</p>
                        <p>44:53 Rhiannon: So Steven Teles, he's the author of The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement. He said that where new legal theories depart from the status quo, judges need those legal theories to be vetted and legitimized through public debate, they require targeted cases, raising questions that provide an opening to move the law, and without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, conservative judges wouldn't be able to do that. So the Federalist Society is intentional and strategic about setting up this broad network nationwide, where judges are getting conservative arguments from professors and these networking events, and they go hand in hand supporting each other.</p>
                        <p>45:34 Rhiannon: So a good example in the news, and I think it even made mainstream news, was this Harvard law student named Chance Fletcher, who...</p>
                        <p>45:42 Rhiannon: You could stop there. That's all you... That name.</p>
                        <p>45:46 Michael: He... In the middle of a class on Zoom pulled out a fucking gun, like a handgun, and was cocking it and opening and looking down at the barrel and cleaning it, and obviously kids were distracted by this and some were upset and... The thing is, this guy is not just a member of the Federal Society, although of course he is, he's the president of Harvard's chapter of the Federal Society, he has a cushy clerkship already lined up with a prominent Republican circuit court judge, I believe. This guy has his future already mapped out, and if he wasn't already like a favorite to eventually be a Supreme Court clerk and a conservative academic or even a conservative judge, this story will make him one.</p>
                        <p>46:36 Michael: And that's how this shit works, they love antagonizing liberals. They love like needling liberals. And this story has made his name and you can see it already, there are people who circled the wagons around him, who've said that this was punching down, talking about a student's behavior in a national magazine or online blog, whatever, like Slate, is inappropriate. You can see the conservative media apparatus rallying around this kid, and this guy is going to be fucking making decisions about women's reproductive rights in a few years, about that.</p>
                        <p>47:13 Peter: And I want to say two things about that. One is, your point that they thrive on the antagonism. You can see it in Kavanaugh's appointment, they love that he fought back and he was screaming at his hearing, and just getting emotional, and accusing the fucking Clintons of being involved, which is insane. And they loved that shit, and that's how their politics work too, I think. Anyone who looks at someone like Trump knows that his real appeal to his base is that he's antagonistic towards the people they hate, and it's important to realize there's no part of the conservative movement where that stops, that is the motivation for reaction. You see people rising up and trying to seize their own power and you fight against it and antagonize and defeat them. That is the purpose of reactionary ideology.</p>
                        <p>48:09 Michael: Yeah, we're not just full of shit or talking out our ass when we say they love antagonizing people. And an example is that the University of Connecticut's Federal Society, a chapter had their own Pride Day where they had custom hoodies with a rainbow on it, made to look like a gay pride flag. But it was Federalist Society Pride, where they would all wear it around with no other purpose, there's nothing to be accomplished here except to try to provoke people who care about things like LGBT Pride. That's it. There's nothing legal here going on, there's no even real political end that they're advocating for, it's just fucking needling their enemies, who happen to be apparently just gay people.</p>
                        <p>49:02 Michael: But that's who they are. They're fucking ghouls. And that's who runs the federal courts right now, which I very much would like to see changed, personally. This is just me...</p>
                        <p>49:16 Rhiannon: Thanks, Michael.</p>
                        <p>49:17 Michael: I'm getting a little drunk and angry now. The Federal Society fucking gets me heated.</p>
                        <p>49:20 Rhiannon: Things are bad and I want them to be different.</p>
                        <p>49:22 Michael: Fuck the Federal Society.</p>
                        <p>49:25 Peter: And look, to tie this back in. The point that we're making is not about Joe Biden in particular, right? It's that when it comes to the courts, the other side is horrific and truly monstrous, and we have always made fun of formalistic reasoning. I promise you, that as useful as formalism is to the Federal Society, they understand our point fundamentally, because their ends are not about legal reasoning, their ends are about conservative domination of politics. They do not give a fuck about textualism or originalism or anything like that, except in so far as those things are means to the end of subjugating the left movement and endorsing and emboldening reactionary movements in our society.</p>
                        <p>50:20 Michael: And this is an important thing to remember too, is if you ever hear anyone describe the Federal Society in any other way, you see someone defending Chance Fletcher online, if you see a talking head describing the Federal Society as anything other than a Republican party apparatus, make a mental note to never listen to anything that person has to say about anything ever. There are enough experts on any legal subject that you don't need to listen to fucking idiots who are going to enable this sort of bullshit and in the process legitimize it. Like fuck those people, they're not worth your time.</p>
                        <p>51:04 Rhiannon: And pretending like it's objective. Pretending like these are principles that, I don't know what the fuck they said, like free speech shit or whatever, and that it doesn't have anything to do with actually hurting minorities.</p>
                        <p>51:20 Michael: Right. Look, at the end of the day, it's like it's an organization that just wants to fucking stick it to people they hate.</p>
                        <p>51:27 Rhiannon: Exactly, yeah.</p>
                        <p>51:28 Peter: But to kind of circle back to this election and what it means. The number of left projects that can be stalled, hampered or outright dismantled by conservative courts is endless, the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, prison reform, immigration reform, LGBT rights, abortion, there are viable conservative legal arguments waiting in the wings to undermine and destroy all of them. Biden himself is not going to do much for a single one of those projects, because he's built an entire career on doing the right thing 20 years after everyone else realizes that it's the right thing to do. But the implications for the longer term left project of losing the courts in this way are stark. And, again, to repeat what we said up top, we're not trying to push you to vote for Joe Biden, what we'd like to do here is give some clarity as to the stakes with respect to the Court.</p>
                        <p>52:28 Michael: Yeah, and if you can't bring yourself to vote for Joe Biden, but this stuff still seems important, you can donate $5 to Sarah Gideon to beat Susan Collins in May. There are competitive races for the Senate, that will help shape the Court just as much as the President or nearly just as much, in Arizona, in Colorado, in Iowa, in Montana, in Maine, in Alabama. There are things you can do other than voting for Joe Biden, if you don't feel like that's something you can do to help on these issues.</p>
                        <p>52:58 Rhiannon: Good point.</p>
                        <p>53:00 Peter: Right. I'm very empathetic towards people who are just like, "Fuck this, I want to sit out. The centrists and this party have done nothing for us." It's been depressing to watch opportunities to turn the courts in this country left, slip away, but it's also been depressing to watch the Democrats trot out this fucking milquetoast centrist platform and these tepid candidates at a time where our country needs actual leadership. The stakes are high and difficult to quantify on both sides, and we're not going to sit here and tell people that we have the answer, and that there's one definitive correct thing to do. I really don't think there is. That's why I don't live in a swing state, I do it on purpose so that I don't have to make these sorts of decisions. The only definitive thing I can say on this topic is that if you are on the left, it's a mistake to be dismissive about the importance of the Supreme Court, and of courts generally. They stand between us and progress, they stand between us and justice.</p>
                        <p>53:56 Peter: That doesn't mean you have to vote based on the Court, but it does mean that your vision of politics and power needs to account for it.</p>
                        <p>54:03 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>54:05 Rhiannon: Woo.</p>
                        <p>54:06 Michael: That's right.</p>

                        <p>54:15 Peter: Alright, next week is Clapper v. Amnesty International. If you're politically conscious and you hear Amnesty International and a case name, you know it's about to get rough. It's a mass surveillance case, it's going to be a banger.</p>
                        <p>54:36 Michael: 5-4 is presented by Westwood One and Prologue Projects. This episode was produced by Katya Kumkova, with editorial oversight by Leon Neyfakh and Andrew Parsons. Our artwork is by Teddy Blanks at CHIPS NY and our theme song is by Spatial Relations.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <div>
                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We will hear argument today in case 07290, District of Columbia versus Heller.</p>
                        <p>00:08 Leon: Hey, everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh, host of Fiasco and co-creator of Slow Burn. On this week's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about guns. For years, most scholars believed the Second Amendment only protected the right to bear arms in the context of a well-regulated militia, but in 2008, in the case of DC v. Heller, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment was actually being much broader, protecting the right of every individual to own guns.</p>
                        <p>00:38 [Archival]: The Court really opened up a whole new chapter in constitutional law, revised the well-understood meaning of the Second Amendment.</p>
                        <p>00:45 [Archival]: There are some people that think that guns kill people as if they jump out of the dresser drawer, walk out the front door, and start shooting at people.</p>
                        <p>00:57 Leon: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:06 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have eaten away at the fabric of American society, like moths in our collective closet. I am Peter, Twitter's The_Law_Boy. I'm here with Michael...</p>
                        <p>01:22 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:23 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:24 Rhiannon: Hello.</p>
                        <p>01:26 Peter: And today we are covering DC v. Heller.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Rhiannon: Boo.</p>
                        <p>01:32 Peter: Relax. The case that granted Americans an individual right to bear arms under the Constitution. If you asked most Americans how long the Constitution has protected the individual's right to possess firearms, I imagine most would say something like, since the country was founded. The actual answer is since 2008 when the Court whipped over a century of jurisprudence on its head in one of the most bizarre decisions in Supreme Court history. And usually we spend the majority of our time on this podcast dismantling the reasoning of the Court. And we're going to do that, and this decision is tacky and lazy and muddled and full of incomplete logic, but here, for our 10th episode, excluding one emergency episode, we want to spend a little more time on how this legal argument was developed by conservative activists, boosted by the NRA and ultimately went from a fringe theory to commanding a majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>02:31 Peter: This is another opinion by Antonin Scalia, and I think it's probably his most famous. Maybe the greatest myth about Scalia is that he's willing to cross the aisle or go wherever his interpretation of the law leads him. We've mentioned before that he is a doctrinaire conservative. His most reliable votes are on hot button conservative issues, those that are getting play in conservative media, and a big one is gun rights. The last thing I want to say before we dive into this, we get accused of bias on this podcast now and then, and I just want to say this before we go in, I think this is a terrible, poorly reasoned decision. That said, I'm not a big anti-gun guy, I don't really give a shit, it's not one of my big issues. I only want to say that because we're going to get accused of being a bunch of big city libs, and again, I just don't care, this opinion sucks, but like, go ahead and buy a gun. I will never give a shit. And I just want to say that up top to silence the haters, which is one of my big priorities here.</p>
                        <p>03:35 Michael: I'm sure that after that disclaimer, Peter, our haters will disappear.</p>
                        <p>03:40 Peter: They know, they know to leave it. So the Second Amendment says, "A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." And until about the 1970s, the Second Amendment right to bear arms was viewed as being tied to the context of the well-regulated militia and, generally speaking, the reasons for this, pretty simple. When the Constitution was drafted, each state maintained its own militia consisting of citizen soldiers. Every white man ages 16 to 60 was required to serve and required to own a weapon. Anti-federalists, the folks who were concerned about federal power, they were worried about the central government disarming or otherwise neutralizing the militias and replacing them with a federal standing army.</p>
                        <p>04:34 Peter: James Madison introduces the Second Amendment largely in response to those concerns, although it should be said his exact intentions, not exactly clear. He didn't mention the individual right to possess weapons in his notes, it wasn't mentioned by Congress during the process, and the term, it should be noted, "bear arms" was used in most records to refer to military service rather than a simple possession of weapons, though as the majority opinion points out, that's a little hazy around the edges for sure.</p>
                        <p>05:03 Michael: Right, and just for some context, in terms of the anti-federalist concerns, in certain states, militias were often used as slave patrols, so we might be able to guess why some states might have been worried about the federal government like disbanding militias and coming for them. I don't know, I'm just saying maybe it's something to think about.</p>
                        <p>05:32 Peter: So over the next century and change after the Constitution is passed, the state-run militias weakened both in form and in function until the Militia Act of 1903 effectively turns them into what is now the National Guard, part of the military reserve that is subject to some state control, but whose funding, training and deployment is largely dictated by the federal government for federal purposes. There is almost nothing remaining of the idea of a state-run militia that could, if needed, stand up to the federal government.</p>
                        <p>06:04 Rhiannon: Right. And so the Supreme Court has addressed the Second Amendment several times throughout history, from the late 1800s through the early to mid 1900s, there was never a recognition by the Supreme Court of an individual right to possess weapons. Looking through history in terms of scholarship and what academics were saying about the Second Amendment, between 1900 and 1960, there were only 12 studies of the Second Amendment in legal journals, and they all framed it as a collective right tied to militias, it wasn't ever interpreted as an individual right to self-defense.</p>
                        <p>06:42 Peter: So politically, there's no significant push for the Court to recognize this right until the 1970s. The NRA prior to that had often supported gun control legislation. When the Black Panthers started openly carrying loaded firearms in public in the 1960s, California Governor, Ronald Reagan...</p>
                        <p>07:02 Rhiannon: Boo.</p>
                        <p>07:04 Peter: Passed the Mulford Act of 1967, which banned the practice, with the NRA's support.</p>
                        <p>07:11 Michael: Right. And in 1955, the NRA itself had an internal report that acknowledged, and I quote, "the Second Amendment appears to apply to a collective, not an individual, right to bear arms." Which again, goes to the idea that it's a militia and not like your right to have a hunting rifle or a handgun.</p>
                        <p>07:33 Peter: Yeah. I also want to mention that prior to the Black Panthers, the Black Panthers were like one issue that sort of centralized gun rights in people's minds. The other it was bank robberies in the '30s, and I just think that's cool as hell. There were so many bank robberies, people were like, "We gotta do something about this."</p>
                        <p>07:49 Michael: Peter was born into the wrong era. He wants those guns with like the round... Like magazines.</p>
                        <p>07:57 Peter: Yeah, yeah, one of those big Tommy guns and I want to rob a bank wearing my nicest suit.</p>
                        <p>08:02 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>08:04 Peter: As the 1970s progressed, more reactionary elements of the conservative movement took hold in conservative institutions, the NRA included, and the idea that the right wing should be taking a harder line on gun rights and the Second Amendment in particular, started to gain some popularity. And in 1977, NRA leadership was voted out and replaced with dogmatic hardline ideologues dedicated to a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment.</p>
                        <p>08:36 Michael: Right, right. For some detail on that shift, in the '60s, like we're saying, there are sort of countervailing forces. Obviously there's the assassinations of many civil rights and political leaders which are maybe pushing towards gun control and the Black Panthers. On the other end of the spectrum was desegregation was creating, especially among white citizens, like a concern about crime, that led to our law, our first law and order President in 1968, Richard Nixon, which also led to a big hard right push for gun rights, for self-defense. And in 1971, this is particularly important, in 1971, an NRA member was killed in a raid by feds with the ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I forget what...</p>
                        <p>09:29 Peter: Bureau. I think it's just Bureau.</p>
                        <p>09:29 Michael: Bureau, right, right, right. And that helped hard-liners get their foothold in with leadership in the NRA, it sort of galvanized them, and it was only a few years later that they were able to fully oust the more moderate leadership that had been holding the fort down up to that point.</p>
                        <p>09:51 Peter: Right. So at this time, this is the Republican Party sort of ideologically coalescing into what we would understand the Republican coalition to look like now. And in 1972, the GOP platform had expressly supported gun control. In 1980 it expressly proclaims the party's belief in the individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. The NRA issues its first presidential endorsement for Ronald Reagan, and at the same time, conservative political operations, NRA included, start funding academic scholarship to support this point of view and argue that the prior two centuries of constitutional scholarship had been incorrect.</p>
                        <p>10:36 Peter: As historian Jack Rakove, I'm butchering your name, Jack, sorry, points out, there are a very small number of historical sources concerning privately owned firearms, and as a result, the revisionists, the NRA revisionists, the right, often recycles the same handful of largely cherry-picked quotations to support their case. The words of Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson get frequently mangled by these types. Jefferson once wrote to Washington that "one loves to possess arms," and he was speaking metaphorically about having copies of old letters to use in a debate.</p>
                        <p>11:16 Rhiannon: Nerd. What a nerd.</p>
                        <p>11:18 Peter: That quote is still on NRA websites, and they would sell it on t-shirts, like...</p>
                        <p>11:29 Michael: And another historian, and I'm not going to risk bungling his name, I'm just going to say a historian has charted...</p>
                        <p>11:34 Peter: Oh, give him credit.</p>
                        <p>11:36 Michael: He's out there.</p>
                        <p>11:40 Rhiannon: He knows who he is.</p>
                        <p>11:41 Michael: He's sort of tried to quantify this, charting the change in scholarship. Rhiannon said up until 1959 or whatever, there was like almost nothing. And so he says, a total of three law review journal articles endorsed the individual right model versus 22 subscribed to the collective view prior to 1970. And then in the next 19 years from 1970 to 1989, 25 articles adhering to the collective right view, as opposed to 27 articles endorsing the individual right model, so a vast chain in the balance of this. And 16 of those individual rights model articles were written by lawyers who had been "directly employed by or represented the NRA or other gun rights organizations," although they didn't identify themselves like that in the author's footnote or anything.</p>
                        <p>12:40 Rhiannon: Just like 5-4, the podcast that does not identify the historians it's quoting.</p>
                        <p>12:46 Peter: That's right. Laws aren't real and neither are historians. So obviously, this sort of academic shift is gaining steam, and it's not just relegated to the academic sphere. In 1982, Senator Orrin Hatch commissioned a study on the right to keep and bear arms, designed to conclude if the Second Amendment contained an individual right to own firearms.</p>
                        <p>13:10 Rhiannon: Yeah, but they still had significant detractors, there are still people saying like, no, no, no, that's not what we think, and in fact, at this time, he was the former Chief Justice, retired Chief Justice Warren Burger, he described this new doctrine as a fraud on the American public.</p>
                        <p>13:27 Warren Burger: This has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime. If the militia, which was going to be the state army, was going to be well regulated, why shouldn't 16 and 17 and 18 or any other age persons, be regulated in the use of arms?</p>
                        <p>13:51 Peter: Yeah, and for some context, Warren Burger, pretty conservative dude.</p>
                        <p>13:56 Rhiannon: Yeah, this is not like the liberal guy.</p>
                        <p>13:58 Michael: No, he was appointed by Nixon, he sort of led the Court's like backlash against the more civil rights minded...</p>
                        <p>14:05 Peter: The reactionary response to the Warren Court, it's confusing 'cause his first name is Warren, that tripped me up for a good half decade there.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:16 Rhiannon: Warren Burger, repudiating Earl Warren.</p>
                        <p>14:19 Peter: Who can keep track of that shit? But this kind of solidifies as the conservative position over the course of the '90s. George W. Bush's Justice Department essentially adopts the NRA position in full, and public opinion shifts over the whole timeframe too, over this sort of half century-ish period. In 1959, Gallup found that 60% of Americans favored banning handguns. By 1975, it was 41%. By 2012, it was 24%. Just before this case comes down, 73% of Americans believed the Second Amendment protected the individual's right to possess weapons. When it did come down, Barack Obama, then presidential candidate, spoke in favor of the decision.</p>
                        <p>15:08 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>
                        <p>15:08 Michael: Right. He also had to deal with his like, "they cling to their guns and religion" Congress.</p>
                        <p>15:12 Peter: He might not have actually supported it and he was maybe equivocating a bit...</p>
                        <p>15:20 Michael: Political...</p>
                        <p>15:20 Rhiannon: Maybe he was a politician.</p>
                        <p>15:20 Peter: Maybe he was politician-ing, but no, look, the point is he had to position himself as supporting this decision.</p>
                        <p>15:25 Michael: Right. The American people were at a place where that was politically expedient, if not politically necessary.</p>
                        <p>15:34 Rhiannon: And so turning to the background of how the Heller case gets to the Supreme Court, you know, I always love to talk about the scary little gremlins who bring these cases to our esteemed Justices. Here's how this goes down. Back in around 2002, senior fellows at the Cato Institute and the Institute for Justice, both of these are libertarian think-tanks, they start vetting potential plaintiffs for a Second Amendment lawsuit. Robert Levy is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute at the time. He's the author of the book, The Dirty Dozen: How Twelve Supreme Court Cases Radically Expanded Government and Eroded Freedom. He's just like some old rich entrepreneur and he says, "I'm going to finance this lawsuit myself personally, that's how strongly I feel about this." And in fact, he's quoted in the Washington Post, when talking about the case, "I don't actually want a gun. I mean, maybe I'd want a gun if I was living on Capitol Hill or in Anacostia somewhere, but I live in Naples, Florida, in a gated community. I don't feel real threatened down here."</p>
                        <p>16:47 Rhiannon: There is a shitload of coded racism and disdain for poor people every time this guy opens his mouth. A little bit later, same interview, he says, "Even when I lived up there, I didn't live in DC, I lived in Chevy Chase in a high rise that was secure." Thank you, Mr. Levy.</p>
                        <p>17:06 Michael: Isn't Chevy Chase like some tony, like Maryland suburb or something like that?</p>
                        <p>17:11 Peter: Yes, it is.</p>
                        <p>17:15 Rhiannon: Whatever.</p>
                        <p>17:16 Peter: And I don't remember hearing us say it, so in case we haven't, the law being challenged in this case was a complete ban on private handgun ownership in Washington, DC.</p>
                        <p>17:29 Rhiannon: Yeah. And Robert Levy says, whatever the price of this lawsuit is, he's going to foot the bill, and he'll do so, "happily," because he says, "I'm in a position to pay for it." Robert Levy says that the Washington DC ban on handguns, "It offends my constitutional sensibilities." Okay, so as they're looking for plaintiffs...</p>
                        <p>17:50 Peter: Imagine having constitutional sensibilities.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:58 Michael: I don't know, this guy...</p>
                        <p>18:00 Rhiannon: Imagine your life being so easy that you can think about the Constitution and what offends you about the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>18:03 Peter: Just like funding lawsuits that have zero impact on your life, and don't really help anyone, he's just like... I would almost respect it if he was like, "My reasoning is that this would help people protect themselves," or something like that, but he's just like, "I don't think this interpretation of the Constitution is correct, I'm going to spend $15 million."</p>
                        <p>18:22 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>18:23 Michael: I was just going to say, listening to this guy talk, I kind of wish leftists had some more Second Amendment constitutional sensibilities.</p>
                        <p>18:34 Peter: Black Panthers, where are you?</p>
                        <p>18:34 Rhiannon: Yeah, we need you.</p>
                        <p>18:38 Michael: The tree of liberty needs to be refreshed.</p>
                        <p>18:43 Rhiannon: So they're strategic about the plaintiffs that they choose. Levy says multiple times publicly, they want economic diversity in the plaintiffs that they're choosing to take this case, gender, age, racial diversity, they want the optics of this to look like, look, this is just regular people or law-abiding citizens who should have an individual right to bear arms. So the case that is filed in the lower court, they end up choosing six plaintiffs, it's three men and women, and four of them are white, two of them are black. Now, the appellate court eventually knocks out five of the plaintiffs because the court says these plaintiffs actually don't have standing to sue because they hadn't tried to register for a handgun in DC. That leaves one plaintiff left, and that's how we get the case name Heller. The guy that's left is Dick Anthony Heller. Now, we have to take some time to talk about this little freak, 'cause he is freaky deaky. This guy is a licensed special police officer in DC. I interpret those words to mean this is a rent a cop. And...</p>
                        <p>19:49 Peter: Where do you get a license but you can't become a cop? Couldn't do enough push-ups to become a real cop?</p>
                        <p>19:53 Rhiannon: Right. He carries a gun at work, but he has to leave it there when he goes home because of the ban on handgun possession in DC. Back in 1996, so years before this lawsuit, he and his roommate, Dane von Breichenruchardt -- fucking white people and their names --</p>
                        <p>20:15 Peter: Yeah, they didn't change that shit at Ellis Island, what happened there?</p>
                        <p>20:18 Rhiannon: He and his cuckoo lulu roommate the US Bill of Rights Foundation, which they basically used to disseminate their wild views about small government and guns, and they purposely decided to have Mr. Heller apply for a handgun knowing that he'll be denied so that they could preserve a legal claim to challenge the ban. So they had thought about this for a long time. After this case, just to give you an idea of where Mr. Heller runs with this, in 2008, he goes on to create the Heller Foundation, whose mission is to promote "a world where arms and self-defense rights are considered as essential to human life as food and water."</p>
                        <p>21:04 Rhiannon: The website, you have to go to the website. The website is absolutely nuts. It's a bunch of photos of like incel dorks raising their fists. Like, "My mom just told me that I look cute in my suit," and there's random quotes riddled all over the website with typos, like, "in a free country one does not permission from gov to own a firearm," and it's like, it's like the banner at the top of the website. It's fantastic.</p>
                        <p>21:31 Peter: Excellent. So Enter Antonin Scalia. This is an incredibly lengthy, often convoluted, opinion. We do not have the time, energy, or emotional fortitude to make our way through it entirely here, but there are several parts that are particularly stupid, and we're going to talk about those. But first, we want to talk about the primary thrust of both Scalia's majority and Justice Stevens' dissent. As we noted, the historical record about the intent of the Second Amendment is very sparse; nevertheless, the majority opinion is predicated in the idea that a historical analysis could definitively establish whether or not there is a Second Amendment right to the individual possession of arms. And both Scalia and Stevens sort of go at it on this front.</p>
                        <p>22:30 Peter: And the number of intellectually hollow assumptions here is mind-blowing, that there is a clear historical answer to this question, that it could be accurately gleaned from the limited record we have, and that a Justice of the Supreme Court could successfully do it. And we're not going to turn ourselves into hypocrites by trying to debunk the historical claims in some sort of orchestrated manner, we're going to try to stick to the legal arguments here, and lucky for us, there are some bad ones.</p>
                        <p>23:00 Michael: Yes, that's right.</p>
                        <p>23:02 Peter: Again, the Amendment reads, "a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." And there's a question of what to do about the "prefatory clause," the portion that says "a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state." And so the question that kind of jumps in your mind immediately is whether the fact that the right follows from a statement about a well-regulated militia means that the right is limited to the context of the militia. And Scalia has a couple of answers to this question, but the big one is that it doesn't really matter, because Scalia says that this clause is for interpretive purposes largely irrelevant. The prefatory clause, as he calls it, is a statement of purpose, and that doesn't impact the right.</p>
                        <p>23:52 Peter: And I want to give this argument a little bit of credence, 'cause I think it's not totally nonsensical as an argument. What he's saying is that the reason being provided for the right isn't relevant, because no matter what the reason is, the bottom line is that the Amendment establishes the right. To give an analogy, if I said you can use our pool because it's hot outside, you can arguably say that because it's hot outside isn't really a relevant part of that. What's relevant is that I'm letting you use the pool, which means you can use it. In some ways, this makes sense, right? The reason for the right can be viewed as sort of background information, the bottom line is the Amendment gives you the right to bear arms. But the problem with that in this particular context is that the reason being provided no longer applies even a little bit. There are no more well-regulated militias, so to use the same analogy it's as if I said, you can use our pool because it's hot outside, but in fact, it's not even a little bit hot outside.</p>
                        <p>24:51 Rhiannon: Or it's never going to be hot outside again.</p>
                        <p>24:54 Peter: In that case, suddenly the reason seems a little more relevant, right? And this is a long way of saying it, and I'm trying to give him some credit here, but this is dumb as shit.</p>
                        <p>25:10 Michael: Another analogy I literally just thought of now is like, you can crash at my place, I'm out of town. Well, what happens when you're back in town? Are we just sharing a fucking bed, or is that offer off the table?</p>
                        <p>25:24 Peter: You said it, Michael, we're going head to toe. Look, the entire reason the right exists according to the Amendment is gone. That's not irrelevant to the interpretation of the Amendment, it is crucial to the interpretation of the Amendment. Just a couple of episodes ago, we talked about how fraudulent the idea that Scalia is an ardent textualist is, and here's another example, right? This is plainly him working backwards from his conclusion. He knows that he can't bring the prefatory clause into the analysis too much, because as soon as you're faced with the fact that the militias are crucial to the Amendment, it's sitting on shaky ground, right?</p>
                        <p>26:01 Peter: So he wants this kind of reason to discard with it. He does sort of say that even if you do assume that it matters that he's still right, but he's trying to create avenues through which he can sort of maintain deniability. And so let's get to the next part of his argument, which is what's a well-regulated militia. And this is sort of... This is his backup plan. Like, what if you have to factor in the prefatory clause? And he's saying, look, look, it's still okay. And he says that according to historical sources, the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense, and that's how he argues that the individual right to carry arms is related to the concept of the militia: Everyone can carry a weapon because everyone needs one, because everyone's part of the militia, right?</p>
                        <p>26:51 Rhiannon: Right, right. And again, we don't want to get too deep into the history here, but there are some definite logical issues with What Scalia is doing. First, the militia at the time of the Second Amendment was not like just this conceptual thing that was theoretically comprised of able-bodied men, it was a literal militia controlled by the states that all able-bodied men were required to serve in, including mandatory military exercises. That doesn't exist now. No such thing exists currently, period, and pretending it does, that's just fantasy world shit.</p>
                        <p>27:29 Michael: Which is a shame, 'cause I think it'd be pretty cool if me and the boys got together and...</p>
                        <p>27:34 Peter: Yeah, you want to go on those slave patrols, Michael?</p>
                        <p>27:42 Michael: Yeah, I don't...</p>
                        <p>27:42 Peter: Wow, canceled. So, and in of the weirdest parts of the opinion, he says that the adjective "well-regulated" implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training, and that's all he says about that term, which is weird, because the term well-regulated is pretty much proof that this militia no longer exists, right, because all able-bodied men are not receiving military training. It's very... But his portion of the opinion that focuses on the well-regulated militia language is like a paragraph, a very short paragraph, and it's just like, yeah, obviously, that just means military training, and then moves on as if we're all receiving military training. And the final point I want to make on this clause and Scalia's warped view of history here is the militias were controlled by the states and were viewed in large part as bulwarks against federal power.</p>
                        <p>28:38 Peter: So how can it be that the Second Amendment prevents the states themselves from controlling what weapons its citizens use in the militia? The dissent doesn't really address it, the majority doesn't really address it, but it doesn't make any sense. If these are really supposed to be under the control of the states, why can't states ban certain weapons? Why can't they dictate what weapons are used in their own militias?</p>
                        <p>29:00 Michael: Right, and so I want to talk for just a brief second about the substance, the substantive question of what the right to bear arms is, what Scalia comes after the prefatory clause. And so Stevens in dissent and Scalia for the Court, they have a different approach here, it's subtle, but Scalia is trying to discern what the original understanding of the phrase "the right to keep and bear arms" would mean to Joe Schmo on the cobbled streets of Boston or wherever in 1791, whereas Stevens is trying to find the original intent of James Madison and the enacting Congress who drafted the Amendment and ratified it. So it's a subtly different question, it's both of them are pursuing a historical originalist analysis. If this sounds like stupid and esoteric and completely divorced from buying guns to go shoot up a school, I would say yes.</p>
                        <p>30:10 Michael: And maybe that's the point, right, is to totally denude this of any fucking meaning whatsoever, so that it's a completely academic exercise. In any event, it's really stupid. If it sounds stupid, you're on the right track, but so Stevens in dissent, he has some good points about how like, look, as Peter mentioned up top, keeping arms and bearing arms were like military terms of art back then, and so we should interpret the phrase "keep and bear arms" as like connoting a military purpose, which works in conjunction with the prefatory clause, which is focused on militias, to make this whole Amendment about military service, service in a militia. And that makes sense. And he's very persuasive if you read nothing but his opinion. Scalia, like busts out the fucking 1790 edition of the Oxford English Dictionary or whatever, and individually tries to define what the words "keep," "bear" and "arms" would mean to the random person in 1790...</p>
                        <p>31:23 Peter: Which the random, by the way... This whole... I'm going to get some of this wrong, but the average IQ is going up like a point every two years, okay. Trying to ask what someone in 1790 thought this meant, it's like trying to talk to your cat. You would have to communicate to these people with motions.</p>
                        <p>31:44 Rhiannon: Right. Like most people at the time would be like, "Oh, my God, you can read? Like, wow."</p>
                        <p>31:49 Peter: Right. Like George Washington was like 6'2", and they were like, "This is the tallest man in all of history."</p>
                        <p>31:56 Rhiannon: They literally overthrew a king and they were like, "He should be a king. Look how tall he is."</p>
                        <p>32:00 Peter: "As the tallest man here, you are in charge of the country."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:11 Michael: Look, I'm not going to say Scalia is wrong, I'm not going to say Stevens is right, because who has the better read on history here is, it's besides the point, right? Like this whole debate is ridiculous. It just doesn't matter. Neither of them are historians. Scalia had an undergraduate degree in history, which I don't know, I had an undergraduate degree in psychology and philosophy, and I'm not fucking counseling people with PTSD.</p>
                        <p>32:38 Rhiannon: I don't go to Michael for therapy.</p>
                        <p>32:44 Michael: Exactly. Neither of them are linguists, which matters, and neither of them are fucking historical linguists, which is like a real field called diachronic linguistics, which has PhDs involved in it. They're arrogant amateurs who are just picking and choosing from their favorite amicus brief about what fits their partisan goals, and that's what it is. And the idea that Antonin fucking Scalia can divine from some dictionary what the random douche bag on the streets would understand the phrase "bear arms" to mean in 1790, it's stupid beyond the point of even being worth like explaining.</p>
                        <p>33:32 Rhiannon: Yeah, and it's a purposeful obfuscation of the issue.</p>
                        <p>33:35 Michael: And so, yeah, this was like between the two of them, it's like 80 pages of bullshit, and we're covering it in about three minutes of me yelling into the microphone, because that's about what it's worth. And on top of this, it's like we mentioned before, that there was some scholarship in the 1890s, discussing the Second Amendment and the idea that some asshole like Scalia would know better what those words meant in 1790 than someone who was born in like 1850, who was writing about it in 1890. I don't care how stupid the guy is, the guy in 1890 knows more. Maybe like the broad thrust of history and the big powers that shape things are easier to see from temporal distance, but like the minute question of the meaning of specific words being used in like a specific way...</p>
                        <p>34:38 Peter: It's not like we've unearthed an artifact, like the original intent was like buried under some cobblestone fucking street in Boston and Antonin Scalia dug it up.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:52 Rhiannon: What's that movie where they...</p>
                        <p>34:53 Peter: National Treasure.</p>
                        <p>34:54 Michael: National Treasure? National Treasure.</p>
                        <p>34:58 Peter: Scalia started writing this when he saw Nicholas Cage in National Treasure.</p>
                        <p>35:01 Rhiannon: Yeah, he was inspired by Nic Cage, just running around.</p>
                        <p>35:08 Michael: God, what a bunch of arrogant assholes these guys are. Unbelievable.</p>
                        <p>35:15 Peter: Alright, let's move on to the final, like big legal issue here, which is the precedent. Prior to this case, the last time the Supreme Court had addressed the scope of the Second Amendment was in 1939, in a case called US v. Miller, where the Court found that a ban on sawn-off shotguns was constitutional, because the possession of those weapons didn't have "any reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia." And as I had mentioned this, this was a bank robbery case, this is like sawn-off shotguns are being used to hold up banks, and that was the big thing that everyone cared about.</p>
                        <p>36:00 Peter: So a lot of people interpret this case as overturning US v. Miller, but Scalia claims that that is not what's happening here. Even though the Court there clearly tied their reasoning to the militia concept in a way that Scalia doesn't, he said that it's consistent with Miller, because what that case stands for in his mind, is the idea that Congress can ban weapons that "are not in common use at the time." Or, if you're reading a little bit between the lines, are primarily used by criminals. And this is just a desperate attempt, I think, by him to square his reasoning with the Court in Miller, and it makes no sense. Why would something is commonly used impact its constitutionality?</p>
                        <p>36:47 Peter: So if you have a rare weapon, that's less constitutional than a popular one? I mean, by this logic, you couldn't make new guns, right. That's just a... That's a rare weapon now. If states legalize a particularly dangerous type of weapon like machine guns, which by the way, Scalia expressly says this doesn't impact machine gun bans, those are still cool, but if a state legalized machine guns, they'd become more popular, right, and then they become more popular and all of a sudden they're protected by the Constitution because they're no longer uncommon. And now, the state can't make them illegal again? Like that's the reasoning that we're going with here? Just absurd, just silly, detached from reality, sort of untethered reasoning.</p>
                        <p>37:28 Peter: A big theme of Second Amendment scholarship is that the right is important for purposes of armed resistance against the government. Not just in scholarship, but in how people talk about the Second Amendment casually, and that creates a weird tension with Scalia's argument, because he's saying that it's fine to ban weapons that are commonly used by criminals, but it should go without saying that armed insurrection against the government is illegal, so when he says criminals, I guess he apparently isn't talking about the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of right-wing freaks who are sort of semi-openly planning a war if the government gets too liberal, from what I can tell. And he says like, guns used by criminals. You know who he means.</p>
                        <p>38:15 Rhiannon: Right, right. It's barely coded, absolutely. Right, yeah, so the Stevens dissent notes that the Second Amendment implications of the law in Miller, and that law was the National Firearms Act of 1934, which banned machine guns and sawed-off shotguns, that wasn't even mentioned by the Senate or the House when the legislation was being debated. There simply was not any real question at the time that it was constitutional. And when I was prepping this case, I found that Justice Stevens, after he retired, this was last year, he wrote a piece for The Atlantic where he talked about this decision, and he says that Heller is "unquestionably the most clearly incorrect decision that the Supreme Court announced during my tenure on the bench." He said also that "it represents the worst self-inflicted wound in the Court's history, and that the Heller decision represents my greatest disappointment as a member of the Court." He does a little bit of the pull back the curtain, kinda talks about the process of reaching the decision and how the majority ended up the majority. He laments his inability to persuade both Justice Kennedy or Justice Thomas to join him.</p>
                        <p>39:38 Peter: What was his angle on convincing Thomas?</p>
                        <p>39:41 Rhiannon: I think that both of them... He goes hard, I mean, they don't go hard at each other at all in public, right, so I'm not going to say that he's pulling out all the punches, but he kinda goes in on Justice Kennedy specifically, but both of them, he says he expected them to respect precedent and stare decisis more than they did, to respect the decision in the Court.</p>
                        <p>40:03 Peter: It goes to show that we're all smarter than John Paul Stevens 'cause I would have never fucking thought that Clarence Thomas could've been pulled into the liberal side of this argument. Kennedy, I guess, like who the fuck knows what matters to that guy half the time, but Thomas, you gotta be out of your mind to think that you could've really convinced him.</p>
                        <p>40:21 Michael: I think it says something that... We've made this point a number of times that Scalia has a reputation of taking his principles, taking them where they go, regardless of where they align with his ideological priors, and that Stevens is talking about two other Justices, including one who's considered like a very doctrinaire conservative, in Thomas, as more regretful inability to recruit than Scalia.</p>
                        <p>40:50 Rhiannon: Well, there's that... I would say throughout the piece, there's a tone from the perspective of Justice Stevens that Scalia's a lost cause, that it was just...</p>
                        <p>40:58 Peter: Yeah, yeah, which is, I mean, because as we... I mean, as we discussed at the top, it's not incorrect that Scalia is driven by his principles. The misconception is that his principles involve certain methods of statutory or constitutional interpretation. What his principles actually are are whatever fucking Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh are saying at any given time. He is not intellectually rigorous, even in the way that Clarence Thomas is, and I think Clarence Thomas is a hack too.</p>
                        <p>41:30 Rhiannon: Right, right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>41:31 Peter: I mean, there's nothing that can pull him away from that. The idea that he's being driven by textualism is something that you could only get by reading the cases that are completely detached from political conflict, and whenever you introduce politics, Scalia is right there on the conservative side of it every single time.</p>
                        <p>41:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>41:52 Michael: And if anybody wants to call out the flag burning case, whatever, shut the fuck up. One case in 40 years...</p>
                        <p>41:58 Peter: Yeah, and it's... And flag burning is also one of those things that there is real libertarian influence on the right about. You have things like, institutions like Cato who are very influential and who butter up Scalia, and have his ear and they're on the flag burning side of that.</p>
                        <p>42:18 Michael: Cato instant spoon-feeding Ossetra caviar, which feels like a thing, like flag burning, that should be easy.</p>
                        <p>42:23 Rhiannon: And just for what it's worth, at the end of this Atlantic piece, Justice Stevens says that he thinks that Heller was decided so much in error that he thinks we need a constitutional amendment to overrule it.</p>
                        <p>42:36 Peter: Okay, get the fuck outta here. Is that really... Is that easier? First, I don't know if our listeners know what the process of a constitutional amendment is, but it is impossible.</p>
                        <p>42:52 Michael: It's a lot.</p>
                        <p>42:52 Peter: To give some context here of how hard it is to pass a constitutional amendment, it needs to be ratified by 38 out of 50 state legislatures. There's multiple ways to do it, but that's like the most realistic one. Is that actually harder than just getting five liberals on the Court? What the fuck? This is like the fundamental issue with the liberals on the Court, where he's like, well, look, now it's precedent, so we have to overturn the whole Constitution to change it. And it's like, are you fucking kidding me? These guys are spitting in your face and you're like, what about US v. Miller, the case from 1939, it's the last case on point. And they were like, fuck off, Justice Stevens, and he was like, well, now we gotta pass an amendment. Like, no, dude.</p>
                        <p>43:41 Peter: So we've pointed out the areas of the majority where we think the reasoning is just terrible and bullshit, and it is. I don't want to back off from that, but the bottom line is, it doesn't matter if you think the reasoning was good, it doesn't matter if you think that the historical framework used by Scalia is more persuasive than the one used by Stevens here. Our point is not just that Scalia is off base here, that his logic sucks or whatever, it's that the establishment of this right by the Court was the result of political will, not the ability of the Court to divine the intentions of the Founders or people at the time of the founding better than anyone else who has come before them. This wasn't like the sort of ability of Antonin Scalia to reach the heart of the issue in a way that no one ever had. This was about a political moment that started in the early '70s and built momentum until it had a majority of the Supreme Court on its side, and that is the end of it.</p>
                        <p>44:48 Peter: They took what was a fringe theory and brought it to the forefront of American political culture, where it stands today, and the sort of nitty-gritty of the reasoning here is interesting to us, I think, as law nerds and it's dumb as shit, and all the things we usually criticize, but it's not the whole story, and it's not even the main part of the story, because we wouldn't be talking about the reasoning of fucking Antonin Scalia on this if there wasn't a quantifiable push by the right to get us there.</p>
                        <p>45:21 Michael: Right, there was a four-decade propaganda effort, which is far more important than Scalia using a medium to channel the ghost of the median American colonists.</p>
                        <p>45:37 Rhiannon: Right, Right.</p>
                        <p>45:40 Peter: So, one of the kind of outcomes of this, and you may have noticed, if you're paying attention to gun laws in a lot of the major cities, especially the big liberal major cities, the possession of handguns, not easy, even though blanket bans on handguns are now unconstitutional, and that's because the cities have sort of responded by doing little ticky-tack regulations here and there that make it effectively illegal to possess handguns. And what Scalia says is, look, he doesn't establish what the standard is, but he says, look, what I do know is that a blanket ban on handguns is a violation of the standard, which it's easier when they establish a standard, but I'm not going to fight him on that point, but...</p>
                        <p>46:20 Michael: He made a similar point in Castle Rock, right? The Court can just say, I don't want to draw the line, but this is beyond it.</p>
                        <p>46:27 Peter: Yeah, I think it's a reasonable thing to do, but what I'll say is it's a good example of how these sorts of rulings can make the law much more convoluted, and you might say, well, a blanket ban on handguns is certainly illegal, but now we're in this like, these spots where the city governments are passing these weird laws about what parts of guns you can own, and you'll see conservatives complain about this shit when there's debate about bump stocks and stuff like that. They'll be like, well, these legislators are passing laws about types of guns and the features of guns that they don't understand. And it's like, well, yeah, that's 'cause you can't just ban handguns. And you have this sort of war between the local governments and the gun rights advocates who develop and manufacture weapons, where they're going back and forth, where they're like, oh, this isn't technically automatic because of this, and then the legislature is trying to wrap their arms around it.</p>
                        <p>47:24 Peter: It's just been fucking chaotic, but if you're a hardcore gun control person, which again, I'm not really, the legislatures still have a lot of tools at their disposal here. You have a huge array of cities and states passing laws like this. The Supreme Court can't take on all the laws at once, and they're always going to be on their heels here.</p>
                        <p>47:46 Rhiannon: Yeah, you know, there... I read, when I was reading about Heller himself, that he continues to be really pissed off at the regulations in DC, and so immediately after this, he took the press with him and went back down to the office to register his handgun, but DC had quickly passed a bunch of other regulations. That was...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>48:07 Michael: That's great.</p>
                        <p>48:10 Peter: That's funny as fuck.</p>
                        <p>48:11 Michael: That's fantastic.</p>
                        <p>48:11 Rhiannon: Yeah. And so he couldn't do it. And so, he was super disappointed in front of the media and everybody was like, "It's been a long battle. How do you feel?" And he was like, "I can't get my gun."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>48:22 Michael: The big obstacle right now to gun control regulation at the federal level is lack of Democratic control of both branches of government, not including the Court, but I guess probably including the Court too. All three branches of government. President, Senate, House and Court, they need a majority in both Houses, they need the Presidency, and they need a Court that's not going to strike it down.</p>
                        <p>48:49 Peter: Look, I actually think we're usually pretty depressing at at the end of these episodes, but I think that DC v. Heller is a fairly symbolic case for conservatives, rather than something that has a real deep impact legislatively. And the Supreme Court is always going to be playing catch-up with it. They really don't have the ability to step in consistently and interfere with like Chicago and New York's efforts and LA's efforts to regulate handguns and other types of guns. So I think if you're a gun control person, it's not something that's going to stop, like common sense gun control as is being proposed by various groups.</p>
                        <p>49:29 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>49:30 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>49:40 Peter: Next week is a special episode. We are not covering a case, instead we will be talking about what the Supreme Court might look like under Joe Biden, the former Senator from Delaware and a 105-year-old mummy.</p>
                        <p>49:57 Michael: 5-4 is presented by Westwood One and Prologue Projects. This episode was produced by Katya Kumkova with editorial oversight by Leon Neyfakh and Andrew Parsons. Our artwork is by Teddy Blanks at CHIPS NY and our theme song is by Spatial Relations.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <div>
                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We will now hear argument in the case of Kelo versus City of New London. Mr...</p>
                        <p>00:08 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh, host of FIASCO and co-creator of Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about a 2005 case that, unlike every other case they've covered so far, was decided by the Supreme Court's liberal wing.</p>
                        <p>00:24 Susette Kelo: My name is Susette Kelo, and the government stole my home.</p>
                        <p>00:28 Leon Neyfakh: At issue in Kelo v New London was eminent domain, which empowers the government to seize a homeowner's land and hand it over to private developers while corporations feast on the spoils.</p>
                        <p>00:40 [Archival]: This is what the US Supreme Court said that the city of New London was justified in taking our homes, an empty field. As far as I'm concerned, it's an empty dream.</p>
                        <p>00:51 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:05 Peter: Welcome to 5-4 where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have left America cracked and barren like hot sunlight beaming down on a drought-stricken plain. I am Peter, Twitter's "The Law Boy", and I am here with Michael...</p>
                        <p>01:25 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:26 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:27 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Peter: Today's episode is Kelo versus the City of New London, case about eminent domain, the right of the government to seize private property. We've received some criticism in our podcast reviews for being "a bunch of libs, millennial leftists" proliferating "politically biased tripe". And we take this criticism very seriously, and that's why this episode, we are taking on a case where the liberals were in the majority. We also wanna note other reviews have described us as immature, using gratuitous profanity, sanctimonious, lacking respect for the practice of law. We will not be making any changes to address those concerns.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:15 Peter: So in this case, four liberals and Anthony Kennedy held that the city of New London, Connecticut could seize private property, including the homes of plaintiff Susette Kelo and several others, and turn it over to a private developer in the name of fostering economic development. And this is a showcase for hypocrisy from both the liberals and the conservatives on the court, I think. The liberals adopted the sort of narrow and formalistic interpretation of the constitution that we usually criticize the conservatives for, and the conservative dissent goes with the sort of context and policy-driven rationale that they themselves usually reject as improper.</p>
                        <p>02:57 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:58 Peter: And, at the end of the day though, we have to hand it to the conservatives here. They were in the right, and this decision gave a green light to local governments to seize property where predominantly poor people live and work, and turn control of them over to wealthy private developers, or private companies, who have no meaningful obligation to do anything with the land. So Rhi, walk us through the background here. What's going on in New London, Connecticut?</p>
                        <p>03:27 Rhiannon: Yeah. So the city of New London, Connecticut had fallen on some harder economic times back in the late 90s. So their population keeps going down, people are moving away from New London, and the city's tax base is therefore decreasing, and the city leaders are looking around and saying, "Okay, we really need a boon in economic development." So enter a little mom and pop shop called Pfizer. The pharmaceutical company back in 1998 begins construction of a major new research facility in New London, and specifically, there's a neighborhood in New London called Fort Trumbull, and that's where the new Pfizer facility is being built. So in response to Pfizer showing interest in having a brand new $350 million facility there in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood, the city of New London re-activates this old private entity, it's a non-profit that's run by the city. It's called the New London Development Corporation, and they charge the New London Development Corporation with developing the Fort Trumbull neighborhood and designing and implementing a plan for new economic activity that would coincide with the Pfizer plant development.</p>
                        <p>04:47 Rhiannon: So that development corporation created a development plan for the Fort Trumbull neighborhood. It was a big plan and it includes a resort hotel, a conference center, a state park, new plans for building a museum, 80 to 100 new residences, plus a bunch of office and retail space. So, in the year 2000, the city of New London approved the development plan and authorized the development corporation to acquire the necessary land in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood to start developing all the businesses. So, the development corporation turned around and they offered to purchase all 115 lots that were in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood, and those lots are both commercial lots and residential lots. But when the development corporation offered to purchase all of the lots, owners of 15 of the properties refused to sell. Now it's nine owners that become the petitioners here, and the lead plaintiff is Susette Kelo. Susette Kelo is a working class person. Interviewers, reporters mentioned that she works two jobs, she had lived there since 1997. Another petitioner, for example, named Wilhelmina Dery, she was born in the house in 1918, the house that she lived in in Fort Trumbull...</p>
                        <p>06:09 Michael: It's fucking crazy. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>06:09 Rhiannon: She was born in that house and still lived there for her entire life.</p>
                        <p>06:13 Michael: Her husband had lived there for 60 years...</p>
                        <p>06:17 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>06:17 Michael: Their kids lived next door. They had roots.</p>
                        <p>06:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, these are lower class working class families and individuals. They had roots, multiple generations in and around this neighborhood, on their properties that they owned for decades. And so the petitioners here, they wanna keep their damn homes. They're saying that the government can't just take their property and first of all, hand it over to a private corporation, and second of all, hand it over to that private corporation just for a promised in the future economic improvement.</p>
                        <p>06:52 Peter: Pretty much the same reaction I think anyone would have to the government just knocking on your door one day and being like, "Alright, you gotta leave." We're gonna...</p>
                        <p>07:00 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>07:00 Michael: We're gonna build a conference center.</p>
                        <p>07:00 Peter: I don't know if you've heard about this but we have to help Pfizer out.</p>
                        <p>07:04 Rhiannon: Yeah, have you guys heard of a little company called Pfizer? They want your backyard.</p>
                        <p>07:08 Michael: Some little like podunk city councilmen who have boners over the idea that their town is gonna become this economic hub.</p>
                        <p>07:17 Peter: Yeah, we'll talk about this in a bit later, but the city council is the lowest form of government, right? I can't think of anything lower throwing the rocks at like...</p>
                        <p>07:28 Michael: School board, school board.</p>
                        <p>07:29 Peter: Yeah, school board. Wow, there you go.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:32 Peter: Okay, I take it back, school board is the lowest form of government, but right above that is city council, so yeah, they're facing off with these homeowners and on their side is one of the biggest corporations in the world.</p>
                        <p>07:46 Michael: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>07:49 Peter: So the legal issue here is about the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment which states that, "Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation." And so the question here is what does public use mean? Does it mean that you they can just take Susette Kelo's house and hand it over to some developer and say that it's for economic development or is it more limited than that? Public use historically had been interpreted to be equivalent to a public purpose. It doesn't need to be public use like a park, it's a little broader than that. It's for the purpose of helping the public but not necessarily accessible to the whole public, for example. And the court holds that this is fine because the city had a comprehensive development plan and they seized the property pursuant to that plan, and the city had decided that the area was in need of rejuvenation and the court should defer to them on that point. And they go on and on about how it's totally consistent with precedents and all that sort of stuff, that we're not gonna get too deep into 'cause it's pretty boring.</p>
                        <p>08:53 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>08:53 Peter: But the fundamental...</p>
                        <p>08:54 Michael: And are not necessarily correct anyway.</p>
                        <p>08:56 Peter: Yeah, yeah. And we'll get into that too, I think when we talk about the Thomas dissent but the gist of this here is what does public use mean under the Takings Clause, and does it apply to a situation where they're just seizing private property and handing it over to some other private entity. And the court's saying, "Well, look, yeah, sure, it's being handed to a private entity, but it's for a public purpose."</p>
                        <p>09:20 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>09:21 Peter: But the new development isn't something that will be available for anyone to use, it's an office complex and some of it...</p>
                        <p>09:27 Rhiannon: Right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:28 Peter: It's nothing else, and if that's a public purpose, then what's a private purpose, right?</p>
                        <p>09:35 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>09:35 Peter: And I think that's like the fundamental problem with the majority here. If that's public, then what could a private purpose possibly look like? And I think using the reasoning of the court, there's nothing really stopping the government from just seizing a poor person's home and giving it to a rich person on the grounds that they have the resources to do better with it.</p>
                        <p>09:56 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:56 Peter: They can make it more aesthetically pleasing, they could start a business there, whatever.</p>
                        <p>10:00 Michael: It's like making gentrification like a legitimate government end that justifies taking people's property, right, essentially.</p>
                        <p>10:07 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:07 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:07 Michael: Originally, the Taking Clause started, it's like building railroads, it's building highways, it's things that like the government wants to do that you can't build the railroad if the house is there, sort of thing. And the extent that there wouldn't be direct public ownership, if there's a private ownership like a railroad, they would be common carriers where the public would have general access to them anyway, right?</p>
                        <p>10:37 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:37 Michael: So the contrast between that and what's going on here is very obvious, you don't have to be trained in legal rhetoric or whatever to understand the difference between building the railroad and building a fucking office park.</p>
                        <p>10:51 Peter: And judges always talk about limiting principles. What is the limiting principle in this reasoning? And there just isn't one. And what I mean by limiting principle is what prevents you from going down that slippery slope of just taking a poor person's home and handing it to a rich person or a rich company because they're gonna gussy it up?</p>
                        <p>11:11 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:11 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>11:11 Peter: And nothing that the majority says really makes it clear that that can't happen, and in fact, I think if you take the reasoning to its natural conclusion that can happen.</p>
                        <p>11:22 Michael: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>11:23 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think so, and I think Justice John Paul Stevens, he's the one who's writing for the majority here, really the only thing he says, and he kind of throws it in at the end is if states wanna pass laws that are sort of more limiting than this rule that we're giving you from the federal constitution, then you can do that if you want, but it's not... That's the only thing...</p>
                        <p>11:41 Peter: Exactly the type of fucking punt that we have lambasted to the conservatives for in the past.</p>
                        <p>11:47 Rhiannon: Exactly, right.</p>
                        <p>11:47 Michael: Or wonderful inversion, yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:49 Peter: Yeah, they're just like, "Well, look, this might sound crazy, but if they wanna change it, they could get both houses in the state legislature together or whatever they need to do and pass a law." And it's like... I don't think that that's a serious approach to analyzing constitutional authority.</p>
                        <p>12:08 Rhiannon: Yeah, because you're not taking into account the major power imbalance, right? Think about Susette Kelo and Wilhelmina Dery. You know what I mean? Like how are they... What are they gonna do? Like, okay, well, we're gonna lobby the state legislator about this because Pfizer is knocking on the door of the city, it doesn't make realistic sense.</p>
                        <p>12:29 Peter: Yeah, and it ignores the history on the ground which is that eminent domain being used to take away the homes and businesses of people of lesser means to give them to entities and people of greater means is very common, and as a result... I don't think we've talked about amicus briefing on the podcast, but amicus briefs are friends of the court briefs, and it's just... If you ever see a Supreme Court case that you're interested in, you can write a brief and be like, "Hey, I have some thoughts on this too." And so a lot of major lobbying groups, etcetera, filed their briefs, and in this case, you see all the sort of Libertarian, usuals like Cato and all their friends filed briefs in support of the petitioners, but so does the NAACP.</p>
                        <p>13:19 Peter: And I think a couple of other civil rights organizations, supporting her case on the basis that these laws disproportionally impact minorities and the impoverished, not coming strictly from this property rights sort of viewpoint that someone like the Cato Institute is gonna have, but saying like, "Look, the way this actually plays out is discriminatory and kind of fucking awful, and the opinion doesn't really tackle it with any seriousness at all." I'm not even sure that it really tackles it.</p>
                        <p>13:47 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's right.</p>
                        <p>13:48 Peter: And, I sort of would love to see a town just condemning wealthy neighborhoods...</p>
                        <p>13:53 Michael: What that would look like.</p>
                        <p>13:55 Peter: Just like, "Hey, we're gonna fucking wipe out these McMansions and just hand it over to a...</p>
                        <p>14:02 Rhiannon: To Chipotle.</p>
                        <p>14:03 Peter: Right, right we're gonna... Look an actual good use of the Takings Clause would be to wipe out some shitty development, hand them each a couple mil and be like, "Alright, we're building section 8 housing here, right?</p>
                        <p>14:13 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:14 Peter: Never gonna happen. Can you imagine?</p>
                        <p>14:16 Michael: Or turn fucking golf club into a public park, that would be legit.</p>
                        <p>14:20 Peter: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:20 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:20 Michael: But, would never happen. Can you imagine like scenario?</p>
                        <p>14:24 Peter: Like Roberts recuses himself because he's a member of the club.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:29 Michael: Thomas, also a member of the club, does not recuse himself.</p>
                        <p>14:33 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:34 Rhiannon: Roberts is like optics guys, fair and impartial, I can't do it, and Thomas is like, "Fuck it, let's do it."</p>
                        <p>14:39 Peter: Yeah. And then it goes 8-0.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:43 Peter: So, Thomas, Clarence Thomas writes... Sandra Day O'Connor writes the primary dissent here, but Clarence Thomas writes a more aggressive dissent, doing all his usual thing, which is like, in this case, sort of not wrong, it's the most I've ever agreed with him on one of his abolished this entire line of precedents sort of dissents, and he starts with long tangents on textual interpretation, and it's just mind numbing, and then, eventually, he gets to the meat of it, in my mind, in his very last section, which is essentially an endorsement of the position outlined by the NAACP where he says, "Allowing the government to take properties solely for the public purpose is bad enough, but extending the concept of public purpose to encompass any economically beneficial goal guarantees that these losses will fall disproportionally on poor communities, those communities are not only systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and best social use, but are also the least politically powerful." Spot on, the whole dissent could have been that.</p>
                        <p>15:41 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>15:42 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>15:43 Peter: It's a viewpoint that Clarence Thomas will completely ignore and dismiss in every other case that ever finds its way to his desk.</p>
                        <p>15:49 Rhiannon: Correct, yes.</p>
                        <p>15:52 Peter: That's sort of an exaggeration, but he obviously finds this sort of thing very unconvincing in other circumstances. Still, unequivocally right here.</p>
                        <p>16:00 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>16:00 Peter: And Kennedy and the Liberals ignore all of this and just pretend it's not happening. We're gonna talk a little bit later about why we think the Liberals did this, but in my mind, it's mostly baffling, it's mostly just bizarre.</p>
                        <p>16:14 Michael: It's hard to wrap your head around.</p>
                        <p>16:15 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>16:16 Michael: I do wanna say, I remember thinking in law school that Thomas's dissent was strong, but some of the early stuff is things that I think I was impressed with in law school, but with a little bit of age and maturity, I'm just shocked that anybody finds it an interesting or persuasive argument at all, like what the dictionary said, the meaning of the word use was in 1780 or what the latin entomology of the word uses. Do we really need a page in the Supreme Court on that?</p>
                        <p>16:50 Rhiannon: Right, I think it makes it so obvious that this shit is all really fake, like I promise you it's fake.</p>
                        <p>16:57 Michael: Yes, yes.</p>
                        <p>16:58 Rhiannon: Because that's not like... This is the Supreme Court deciding major decisions, landmark decisions that will affect thousands, if not millions of people, you know what I mean? Like state laws for decades to come, all of this stuff, and they're like, "Oh, what did the dictionary say 200 years ago?"</p>
                        <p>17:13 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:14 Rhiannon: That's not a fucking answer.</p>
                        <p>17:15 Peter: It's also not their field.</p>
                        <p>17:16 Michael: Latin etymology.</p>
                        <p>17:16 Peter: Clarence Thomas doesn't know shit about what the fucking Latin etymology means to the point where he can make these fine distinctions.</p>
                        <p>17:25 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>17:25 Peter: He's just rambling on about it. And I always imagine Susette Kelo herself reading... Someone's like, "Hey, this dissent really agrees with you," and she's just reading through the first eight pages of it like, "What the fuck is this?"</p>
                        <p>17:35 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>17:35 Michael: What the fuck? What is this shit.</p>
                        <p>17:38 Rhiannon: Yeah, "This doesn't do shit for me."</p>
                        <p>17:40 Michael: It's so disconnected.</p>
                        <p>17:41 Peter: Yeah. And so, that's the first issue, was like, "How is this a fucking public use?" Right? And the term has become so bastardized that it appears to be meaningless to the court here. But there's another issue, and if you dig a little deeper, it's related, it's that the public use in question here is "Economic Development," which is a vague and almost meaningless term that without some level of real scrutiny by the court, is basically just handing municipalities free rein to seize and repurpose property at their whim, right? What's economic development? What is economic growth, even? Right. I mean it's... These things are arbitrary to a degree where any municipality or State can manipulate them to their ends. And the dissent, basically, says we should probably just eliminate this as a legitimate reason for a taking, under the fifth Amendment. I think that's right. This might be the... One of the few times where I'm just like, "Sandra Day O'Connor, right on the head," I think that's right.</p>
                        <p>18:43 Rhiannon: Right. I like her dissent here, maybe just a little bit more than Thomas's, just because I feel like it's short and sweet, it's tight, it's pretty succinct, and she calls out... It's what we've said a few times, the conservatives on the court have been willing to do for decades and the Liberals just aren't, she calls out what is sort of facially obvious and ridiculous about Steven's majority opinion and fun fact, did you guys know this about Sandra Day O'Connor? She went to Stanford Law and she was part of the graduating class of 1952, which was the only law school class in history that produced two Supreme Court Justices. Do you know who else?</p>
                        <p>19:22 Michael: Was it John...</p>
                        <p>19:23 Peter: 52? I don't know.</p>
                        <p>19:24 Rhiannon: It was William Rehnquist.</p>
                        <p>19:27 Peter: I was gonna say it could be Rehnquist, but I thought he was younger.</p>
                        <p>19:29 Rhiannon: William Rehnquist graduated first in the class, and our girl, Sandy, graduated second.</p>
                        <p>19:34 Michael: Damn.</p>
                        <p>19:35 Peter: Damn, beaten by Rehnquist, what a fucking moron.</p>
                        <p>19:38 Rhiannon: Can you...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:41 Rhiannon: Can you fucking imagine though being a woman in law school in 1952 Stanford and then graduating second, and then it's fucking Bill Rehnquist who ends up being your shitty boss?</p>
                        <p>19:49 Michael: Can't get out of that guy's shadow, your entire life.</p>
                        <p>19:51 Rhiannon: Yeah. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:51 Peter: I know, right?</p>
                        <p>19:52 Michael: Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>19:52 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:53 Peter: Yeah, that's gotta be rough. Sandra Day O'Connor, I agree with her very little. But yeah, I think probably worth noting, that to rise out of the 1940s and '50s to prominence as a woman and as an attorney, insanely accomplished person. Probably, you're just tough as fucking nails, if I had to guess.</p>
                        <p>20:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. But I think there's also probably something to be said about the conservatism too. She...</p>
                        <p>20:18 Peter: Oh, it helps. No doubt. I mean...</p>
                        <p>20:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, it helped her get to the level that she did.</p>
                        <p>20:22 Peter: It helped her. It helped Clarence Thomas, right?</p>
                        <p>20:25 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>20:26 Peter: There's no question that she's insanely talented. But certainly, being a woman and a conservative was something that she was able to leverage, maybe not knowingly or not intentionally, but was able to leverage to where she is.</p>
                        <p>20:38 Rhiannon: Sure. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:38 Michael: She had a couple of other points in dissent that, I think, are worth discussing, like the court talks about how the town went, through all this trouble, coming up with a plan, right?</p>
                        <p>20:47 Peter: Right. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>20:48 Michael: The New London Development Corporation had an economic development plan, and the Supreme Court puts a lot of weight on this fucking little town's corporation development plan.</p>
                        <p>21:00 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:00 Michael: And it's like, "Well, look, we got to defer on this." The dissent has some questions about that, and I think we also have some questions about that. 'Cause it's like, really...</p>
                        <p>21:08 Peter: Yeah. I think our questions are a little more pointed.</p>
                        <p>21:12 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>21:12 Rhiannon: Yeah. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>21:12 Michael: The Supreme Court...</p>
                        <p>21:13 Peter: Do you need to fucking defer to the City Council of New London, Connecticut when you're the Supreme Court? How much deference do these people really deserve?</p>
                        <p>21:21 Michael: Yeah. And like... Kennedy is like, "Look, if there is any evidence of untoward influence by private parties on the City Council, that should be considered." And I forget if it was O'Connor or Thomas who was like, "You'd have to be a fucking idiot to be able to avoid like... "</p>
                        <p>21:40 Peter: Of course, they're influenced by Pfizer's fucking pride.</p>
                        <p>21:43 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:43 Peter: The guy that they meet with from Pfizer who walks in and is like, "Hey wouldn't... Here's our pitch." That guy is the most powerful person that city councilman has ever met in his life. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>21:52 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:53 Rhiannon: Right, right. It's a city of 20,000 people at about the year 2000, and Pfizer is saying like, "$350 million facility, we're gonna build it in your backyard." What are they supposed to do? Of course, they're gonna, you know.</p>
                        <p>22:06 Michael: You don't need a private eye with a telephoto lens taking pics of city councilmen taking a briefcase in a dark alley or whatever, right?</p>
                        <p>22:14 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:15 Michael: The influence is out in the open. It's obvious. It's ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>22:19 Peter: And that's why there needs to be some substantive check against the ability of some city, some random politicians and some city to just seize the property of the poorer citizens. There needs to be something somewhere like, ideally, a court, that can just hop in and say, "Hey, taking a look at this, maybe you should be... We're gonna apply this somewhat more rigid standard and not just give you every benefit of the doubt since you are obviously in the pocket of this fucking nightmare corporation who's like working on a pill that allows you to murder and then forget it or whatever."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:56 Peter: I don't know what Pfizer was doing at the time.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:00 Michael: The other point the dissent makes that I just wanna mention really quick is like, if you can do all these formalistic, "Oh, the precedent says this." and like, "The law says that bullshit." You, at least, need to do it well.</p>
                        <p>23:14 Rhiannon: Get it right.</p>
                        <p>23:15 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:15 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:16 Michael: And the majority relies on two cases, and one of them is in Hawaii when Hawaii first became a state and only 22 people owned almost all the property on one of the islands. So the state used eminent domain to take it because they're like, "This is essentially monopoly and it's distorting the real estate market." Right?</p>
                        <p>23:36 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>23:37 Michael: And handed it over to private individuals. And O'Connor is like, "Look, the public purpose here was divesting these monopolists of property." Doesn't matter that it was handed over after the fact that was the public purpose and you're totally missing the obviousness of this case. And the majority has no answer for that. It's the most backwards reading of the case, which... It's like if that's all you have, you at least gotta get it fucking right, man.</p>
                        <p>24:05 Peter: Right. This is why it's such an inversion of a lot of the cases we've tackled, 'cause the conservatives in dissent are just like, "Can we approach this with the least bit of fucking nuance?"</p>
                        <p>24:14 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:14 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:16 Peter: And the majority is like, "No. Actually, we're gonna take this weirdly hard line on it." Which is really... I don't wanna paint with too broad of a brush, but that's usually the conservative approach.</p>
                        <p>24:25 Michael: Yeah. Kennedy's maybe the most bizarre here in the majority. I don't know if you guys agree with me on that. Kennedy is like, he makes the most nods towards libertarian ideas...</p>
                        <p>24:35 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:36 Michael: Which are very centered on property.</p>
                        <p>24:37 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:37 Michael: Property ownership and property rights is the heart of libertarian ideology. And here he is just shrugging his shoulders at it getting fucking trampled on, whereas less-libertarian conservative colleagues are like, "This is too much."</p>
                        <p>24:50 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:50 Peter: No, it is weird. And he is... I think if you ask most people who's, like, who are the more libertarian justices over the past 25, 30 years, he'd be up there.</p>
                        <p>24:58 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:58 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:00 Peter: I think that's why he writes the concurrence. And the concurrency rights, it's basically just these proposed limitations on the power to try to assuage people, I think, that this won't be too bad. But it's total... Yeah, my eyes glazed over real quick. I didn't get through it.</p>
                        <p>25:14 Michael: Yes. [chuckle] Yeah, yeah, I know. I get that.</p>
                        <p>25:15 Peter: I was like, "I was skimming pretty bored, pretty bored." So sorry. You can go to another podcast where they read everything.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:23 Peter: If you wanna hear about that shit.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:25 Peter: Look, before we move on to what happened in New London, Connecticut after this case, I wanna leave you with one quote from the dissent, which is Sandra Day O'Connor saying, "Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory under this majority opinion." And I think that's just spot-on. There's nothing within the reasoning of the court that prevents this from being completely out of control, nor is the actual circumstance here in control. This isn't a circumstance where the majority's position makes sense, but you could see the slippery slope. This is a situation where the majority's position is awful, both in the application here and in theory.</p>
                        <p>26:09 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:09 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>26:10 Peter: So Rhi, how did it go with New London?</p>
                        <p>26:14 Michael: Tell us about the corporate utopia that this ushered in to the city of New London.</p>
                        <p>26:18 Rhiannon: Wait, yeah. Wait, do I sense sarcasm? Do you guys not trust that Pfizer really came in and spruced up the place?</p>
                        <p>26:22 Peter: We imagine that our listeners have heard of the utopia in New London, Connecticut these days.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:28 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>26:28 Peter: But fill us in on the details.</p>
                        <p>26:30 Rhiannon: Yeah, so this case took five years. So it started in the year 2000 when Susette Kelo and the petitioners refused to sell to the city and... The Supreme Court decision after going to the Connecticut Supreme Court, etcetera, the supreme court decision was handed down in 2005. So immediately after the decision is handed down in 2005, after the city takes its W, they turn around and announce plans to charge the residents for back rent for the past five years.</p>
                        <p>27:01 Michael: Fuck.</p>
                        <p>27:02 Rhiannon: Saying that the petitioners had been on condemned city property the whole time and that they owed the city, tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
                        <p>27:09 Michael: That's so fucked.</p>
                        <p>27:10 Peter: It's like... Just no mercy.</p>
                        <p>27:12 Rhiannon: Right? Exactly.</p>
                        <p>27:12 Peter: Just relentless.</p>
                        <p>27:13 Rhiannon: That lawsuit is eventually settled and the city agreed to pay some additional compensation to the homeowners as well as physically moving Susette Kelo's house. So in terms of the development that happened in the Fort Trumbull area... Listener, you're gonna be disappointed. So a Boston-based developer had originally scored exclusive rights to develop a big chunk of that Fort Trumbull area, but they never secured funding and the rights expired after being extended multiple times, the rights expired in 2008. Today, large... A majority of the area remains undeveloped, and so the city never enjoyed new tax revenue from those properties or from that development, and in fact, it's so undeveloped that after Hurricane Irene, the area was literally turned into a dump like for the trash. The trash that...</p>
                        <p>28:11 Peter: I thought you were gonna say the value went up after Hurricane Irene.</p>
                        <p>28:14 Rhiannon: No. No. No.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:14 Rhiannon: The city made it a dump.</p>
                        <p>28:15 Michael: God.</p>
                        <p>28:16 Rhiannon: Okay, but what about Pfizer then? I mean, Pfizer had that $350 million research facility, right?</p>
                        <p>28:22 Michael: Massive. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:23 Rhiannon: Pfizer, for its part also, eventually abandoned the project in 2010 at the same time, coincidentally that their tax breaks from the city were set to expire.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:35 Rhiannon: They announced that they were closing the New London facility and they took about 1,500 jobs with them. So the final cost to the city and the state for the purchase and bulldozing of the formerly privately-held property was about $78 million. As of 2018, the area remains an empty lot.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>29:00 Michael: Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>29:00 Peter: Oh my god.</p>
                        <p>29:01 Rhiannon: Yeah, not to mention the cost and judicial resources and all of this, of taking this all the way to the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>29:05 Peter: Right and the fucking tax breaks for Pfizer which must have been ungodly...</p>
                        <p>29:07 Rhiannon: Yeah. Right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>29:09 Michael: They paid 20% property tax on 20% of the value of the property for a decade.</p>
                        <p>29:15 Rhiannon: Yeah. So Susette Kelo, several years after the decision came down, she's interviewed just about her experience and about her thoughts about like... Was this valuable? Was it worth it to you? Obviously, the petitioners lost, and she says, "In the end, it was seven of us who fought like wild animals to save what we had. I think that though we ultimately didn't win for ourselves, it has brought attention to what they did to us, and if it can make it better for some other people, so they don't lose their homes to a Dunkin Donuts or a Walmart, I think we did some good." So, go off my libertarian queen, Susie.</p>
                        <p>29:49 Peter: Yeah. She's cool.</p>
                        <p>29:50 Michael: There's another quote, sorry, I wanna add really quick...</p>
                        <p>29:53 Rhiannon: Please.</p>
                        <p>29:53 Michael: This was from a retrospective in the New York Times, the city councilman who was set to become New London's mayor, in 2010, talking about Pfizer leaving, says, "Basically, our economy lost 1,000 jobs, but we still have the building."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:09 Michael: Then he added, "I don't know who's going to be looking for a building like that in this economy."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:15 Rhiannon: Oh my god.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:18 Peter: Yes. That's the sort of can-do attitude it takes to be the mayor of New London, Connecticut folks.</p>
                        <p>30:23 Michael: Yeah. There you go. So, they have a massive empty building with nothing to do with it in a dying town.</p>
                        <p>30:31 Rhiannon: Yes, surrounded by an empty lot that's on and off used as a dump after natural disasters.</p>
                        <p>30:36 Peter: Are there any other companies here that have 25,000 employees that could...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:41 Peter: Spare a few?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:43 Michael: There are eight corporations in the world that could make use of this facility.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>30:50 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:50 Peter: Right. So I think that brings us to one of the big themes here, which is like, Pfizer in this situation, was almost certainly able to effectively commandeer the governments of New London to get what it wanted in exchange for almost nothing in the sense that...</p>
                        <p>31:09 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>31:09 Peter: They didn't have any real affirmative obligation to do anything, it was just these promises that they sprinkled across the town, and the amount of money and power they have is so significant that these weak local governments and even stronger local governments, as we'll discuss aren't really in a position to say no?</p>
                        <p>31:27 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>31:27 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:27 Peter: And this happens with some frequency. So in 2017, the electronics manufacturing giant, Foxconn, announced that it was gonna open a 20 million square foot plant employing 13,000 people in the relatively small town of Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. In order to build that plant, they needed property that was at the time a residential development. They bought some folks out, there's some hold outs, the usual story. The kind of twist here is that in the wake of Kelo, a lot of states passed laws saying that economic development was no longer a valid reason for the government to use eminent domain.</p>
                        <p>32:04 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:05 Peter: Wisconsin was one of those states. So you can't seize it. Right?</p>
                        <p>32:09 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:09 Rhiannon: Wrong.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:10 Peter: Mount Pleasant re-zones the properties to call them business districts.</p>
                        <p>32:16 Rhiannon: Ay ay ay.</p>
                        <p>32:17 Peter: And then...</p>
                        <p>32:18 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:19 Peter: Because they're zoned as business districts, the residential properties are considered blighted, and blighted means that the... It's a legal term for land that is dilapidated or otherwise in poor condition.</p>
                        <p>32:35 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:35 Peter: Which would usually mean something that is falling apart.</p>
                        <p>32:38 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:39 Peter: In the context of a business district, however, residential homes may be arguably deemed...</p>
                        <p>32:45 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:45 Peter: Blighted.</p>
                        <p>32:46 Michael: Yeah, it becomes like a formalistic, sort of, precisely the type of legal bullshit we despise on this podcast.</p>
                        <p>32:54 Peter: So they declare them blighted and kick the residents out. Foxconn is doing there, what many corporations do in this situation. Right?</p>
                        <p>33:03 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:04 Peter: Wield the possibility of enormous investment and jobs above a municipality that is not in any position to realistically say no.</p>
                        <p>33:11 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:12 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:12 Peter: And they leverage that position to get what they want at the expense of the community, and the risk is borne entirely by the community.</p>
                        <p>33:20 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:20 Peter: Just like Pfizer backed out in New London, Foxconn has dramatically scaled back its plans, I think it's down to 1,000 jobs now. And just a fraction of what it was. But they have wiped out a residential development. And there's no constitutional remedy for that because of this case.</p>
                        <p>33:38 Michael: Yeah, and so it's not just small local governments that get bulldozed here, sometimes this happens in cooperation with big powerful city governments.</p>
                        <p>33:49 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:50 Michael: In the case of New York that's happened multiple times, actually. One is this billionaire developer, Bruce Ratner, who came upon a nice neighborhood in Brooklyn that had a great subway stop with an intersection of a bunch of different lines, and he really liked the look of it and the feel of it, and was like, "Man, I would love to build some high-rise towers here in this rapidly gentrifying neighborhood that is being developed regardless." But he couldn't buy people out and there was a rail yard there and things like that, so he bought the New Jersey Nets and then...</p>
                        <p>34:27 Rhiannon: Oh.</p>
                        <p>34:27 Peter: Used... Used the idea of building an arena for the Nets as a public use for the purpose of eminent domain to seize property, build the arena...</p>
                        <p>34:39 Peter: Classic moves. All classic moves. You know those moves. You buy the sports team...</p>
                        <p>34:43 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah [laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:43 Michael: Right. Yes.</p>
                        <p>34:44 Peter: You can dangle the arena over their heads 'cause I've done this many a time.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:47 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>34:48 Michael: Right. He built his highrises around the arena. He sold the team, kept the arena rights, so now he gets to charge rent to the team. He gets to build his fucking highrises and the neighborhood is wiped out.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Rhiannon: Bruce Ratner is an insane evil billionaire name.</p>
                        <p>35:06 Michael: It's Bond villain level.</p>
                        <p>35:08 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:08 Peter: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:09 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:10 Michael: The other example... It's Columbia just... I think in a previous episode, we mentioned the idea of universities being real estate hedge funds, essentially. And Columbia is...</p>
                        <p>35:18 Peter: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:18 Michael: I think, a great example of that in terms of just using eminent domain, either the threat of eminent domain to bully people into selling them stuff or for the hold outs waiting till the entire neighborhood that they own 80% of gets completely run down because it's all abandoned buildings.</p>
                        <p>35:36 Peter: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:36 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>35:36 Michael: Then getting the entire neighborhood declared blighted because their empty buildings are infested with roaches and rats and shit, and the people living there have no access to laundromats or anything, 'cause they bought the only laundromat and left it vacant. And then using that to bully out the hold outs so that they can develop a new campus up in West Harlem. So of course, the people that Columbia is displacing here are minorities and working class people, or middle class people. It's like... And I think one of the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits over this owned a gas station or something like that. And you read the interviews with the residents holding out there... And the laundromat example I gave was not abstract, there were people complaining that they no longer had access to laundry.</p>
                        <p>36:25 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:26 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:27 Michael: And that's, again, that's people renting or who maybe own a small apartment and who've lived there for years, who just cannot live there anymore as a practical matter who are being forced out by a big powerful $11 billion endowed University that serves mainly the rich.</p>
                        <p>36:48 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:48 Peter: Right. And they're using a justification that's like... The whole idea of public use is the sort of implication that this will be beneficial for the community.</p>
                        <p>36:56 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:56 Peter: As if these people aren't part of it. And as if the idea that Pfizer or Foxconn or Columbia fucking University can dangle this over any resident's head, whenever they want what they want, and that that end goal in their mind is actually fostering the growth of the community rather than just their own private goals. It's ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>37:19 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:19 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:19 Michael: Yeah. I don't believe New York ever passed a law in the wake of Kelo, but I'm not sure it matters.</p>
                        <p>37:24 Peter: No I don't think so.</p>
                        <p>37:25 Michael: Because as all this seems to have happened...</p>
                        <p>37:27 Peter: Yeah, it's... And you just figure out little ways around it.</p>
                        <p>37:30 Michael: It's like local politicians... Like, Bloomberg... My recollection is... Was very much behind Ratner's project with the Nets and... It's like...</p>
                        <p>37:39 Peter: Yeah, what can you... When that much money starts accumulating behind something...</p>
                        <p>37:44 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>37:44 Peter: Power will follow.</p>
                        <p>37:45 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:45 Peter: And there's only so much you can do, especially when the only people standing in the way here are gonna be homeowners that very rarely have any means.</p>
                        <p>37:54 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:54 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:55 Peter: People always talk about the benefits of unionization in the employer/employee context, but I always think about how useful it would be for municipalities across the country to just fucking band together and agree not to offer tax breaks to these psychotic companies. And...</p>
                        <p>38:09 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>38:10 Rhiannon: Yes, that's so smart.</p>
                        <p>38:12 Peter: Jesus Christ, if you could just have an agreement that you won't do it. Like, "We are one of those cities that won't do it," eventually the benefit would completely dissipate and they would be forced to actually pay. But no city councilman... Again, just a step above the school board.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>38:30 Peter: No city councilman is ready to tread that ground.</p>
                        <p>38:34 Rhiannon: Why don't you run Peter.</p>
                        <p>38:35 Peter: For school board? I'm going to.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>38:43 Peter: So I think that, kind of, our last thought here is a retrospective of sorts on what the fuck happened to the liberals here.</p>
                        <p>38:51 Rhiannon: Yeah. Why the fuck are the liberals doing this in this case? And I think, it's just this trust in institutions, including corporations. But a 10-year-old gets this, which is like, "What interest does a corporation have in the economic development of these community members?" None at all. That's not the goal of what they're doing.</p>
                        <p>39:11 Peter: I've been thinking about this 'cause we've been bouncing around like, "What were the liberals actually thinking here?" And there hasn't been... We haven't come up with anything satisfying, frankly. The only thing I can really think is that for someone like Ginsburg or Stevens, maybe the fact that the conservative ecosphere was going nuts about this on the other side made them feel like this had to be the correct position.</p>
                        <p>39:34 Michael: Right. There's a negative partisanship.</p>
                        <p>39:36 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:36 Peter: Yeah. They were like, "Well, look, I don't really know about this, but if Cato is like filing lengthy briefs and writing teary op-eds about it then surely we've gotta be on the opposite side." I think that must be part of it psychologically, but I really think, yeah, it's just this trust in the government's ability to do economic planning. And they...</p>
                        <p>39:57 Michael: And almost...</p>
                        <p>39:57 Peter: Engage in this sort of bullshit formalistic precedent heavy, de-contextualized analysis that is just like the exact thing that conservatives do consistently, and when they're at their weakest. Someone like Ginsburg notorious for starting her opinions with the context rather than legal rules, and she's quiet here. It's bizarre to me.</p>
                        <p>40:22 Michael: Yeah, no, I do think it's almost a painfully naive trust in government at any level on any subject that sort of suffuses this like, "Oh, of course, the city council has an economic development plan, and who are we to question that." Who the fuck are you? You are the Supreme Court, that's who you are.</p>
                        <p>40:43 Rhiannon: Right. Right. Yeah, exactly. Worth noting too, I think, that in his autobiography, John Paul Stevens, he doesn't say it explicitly, not strongly, but says, "This opinion is kinda fucked up, and I regret the way I wrote this." He says that it was in his opinion, the most unpopular opinion that he wrote in his career as a Supreme Court Justice, like 30 years or something like that. And although he says that he still stands by the result that was reached, the holding, he says that his use of precedent was incorrect.</p>
                        <p>41:18 Peter: Yeah, that makes me more upset. That's...</p>
                        <p>41:21 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>41:22 Peter: It's the complete opposite. The use of precedent is completely irrelevant and tangential.</p>
                        <p>41:27 Rhiannon: Right. That's so fucking liberal.</p>
                        <p>41:28 Peter: It is like, "Oh, sorry, we used the wrong rules."</p>
                        <p>41:31 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>41:32 Peter: But also, the precedent was the, literally, not exaggerating I don't think, the entire basis for the opinion. So to say you got the precedent wrong but the holding right, it's almost meaningless in this.</p>
                        <p>41:43 Michael:  Right, right.</p>
                        <p>41:44 Peter: On the flip side of this, though, is that when we've been praising the conservative position here to some degree, they aren't so skeptical of government institutions when it comes to national security and immigration. And perhaps some application of that skepticism that you see in Kelo to those cases would be beneficial for them. And I think that that sort of underlines the fundamental point here, which is yet another example, in this case, neither side is really consistently applying a judicial philosophy of any coherence, right.</p>
                        <p>42:19 Peter: Here's the liberals doing what we say that the conservatives do often, rigidly applying precedent without any real inspection of the context, because that's what gets them to the conclusion that I think that they were instinctively biased toward. And on the flip side, you have the conservatives opposing it, applying principles that they would otherwise disregard. The bottom line is that you don't need to look that hard at their reasons because they're fake. You can take a step back and think like, what actually matters here? To me, what is holding in this case imply what might result from it on the ground precedentially, however you wanna view it, you can take a step back and dismiss the ostensible reasons provided by these incredibly powerful hacks.</p>
                        <p>43:07 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:07 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:07 Michael: I mean, honestly, it's very reductive, but eight of the nine votes can be explained by like, "I really trust the government," for four liberals and, "I really think property rights matter," for the four conservatives. And it's just Kennedy who's like... What the fuck is he doing... Wandering off into the wilderness with this shit.</p>
                        <p>43:30 Rhiannon: Yeah. Anthony, come back? You okay? Somebody check on Anthony.</p>
                        <p>43:34 Peter: Yeah, we touched on him with Citizens United and his concurrence here is another great example. The most important thing to remember about Kennedy is that, I don't mean this to be just an insult, he's just not that smart. He's really just not that sharp. Obviously, he's sharp in some ways. I'm not sitting here telling you that these fancy degrees mean absolutely nothing or whatever. He's smart in some ways that you're probably not, but he is fundamentally, in many important ways, not the sharpest fucking tack. You don't need to look that much more into it.</p>
                        <p>44:06 Michael: It might legit be that he's been like, "Wow, that neighborhood would look really nice with a conference center."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>44:13 Michael: There might not be more to it than that.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>44:18 Peter: Yeah. The day will come we'd do an entire episode on Anthony Kennedy. He really is the Supreme Court's goofy dumb uncle. He's such a weirdo, and he held this court under his yoke for 25 years.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>44:33 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>44:35 Peter: It's unbelievable.</p>

                        <p>44:46 Peter: Alright, next week is DC v. Heller.</p>

                        <p>44:51 Peter: That's a big one. Second Amendment case from 2008, Gun rights, Antonin Scalia, all coming together in one beautiful package.</p>
                        <p>45:02 Rhiannon: I don't want to read this again.</p>
                        <p>45:06 Peter: You're gonna read it. You're gonna read it, Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>45:06 Rhiannon: Fuck.</p>

                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We'll hear argument now, Number 04-278, The Town of Castle Rock v. Jessica Gonzales.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:10 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone. This is Leon Neyfakh, host of Fiasco and co-creator of Slow Burn. On this week's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Castle Rock v. Gonzales.</p>
                        <p>00:23 [Archival]: Back in 1999, three little girls aged 10, 8 and 7 were shot to death by their father.</p>
                        <p>00:31 Leon Neyfakh: This is a gruesome case, brought in 2005 by a Colorado woman named Jessica Gonzales. Gonzales had a restraining order against her ex-husband. But when he kidnapped her three children, the police ignored her requests for help. All three children were murdered. The Supreme Court ruled that the police had no obligation to enforce the restraining order.</p>
                        <p>00:50 [Archival]: So, if restraining orders are not enforced, then they're not worth the paper they're written on.</p>
                        <p>00:57 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:08 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have weakened America, like rust slowly eating a steel beam. [chuckle] I am Peter, Twitter's The Law Boy, and I am here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:25 Michael: Hey everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:28 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:29 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:30 Peter: And we are all coronavirus quarantined remote from our closets. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:35 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>01:35 Peter: What a terrible world we all live in, [chuckle] but we will never let it stop us from podcasting about the law.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:45 Michael: That's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>01:47 Peter: Today's case is Castle Rock v. Gonzales, a case that features two of my least favorite things in the world, procedural technicalities and the brutal murder of innocent children.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:01 Michael: In no particular order are those two things, yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:06 Peter: This case is, I think maybe the most tragic and poignant in a long line of cases in the Supreme Court and in other courts that have allowed police officers and police departments to escape any legal responsibility, even in cases where their actions are grossly negligent and lead directly to the loss of human life.</p>
                        <p>02:25 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>02:25 Peter: The issue here, simplifying a little bit, is whether the police are liable under the 14th Amendment's, Due Process Clause, when they don't even attempt to enforce a restraining order involving a rather insane husband, shall we say?</p>
                        <p>02:40 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>02:42 Peter: We'll get into the semantics, but the real question is this, I think, "Do the police owe the public, anything at all?" [chuckle] And the Court thinks probably not.</p>
                        <p>02:53 Michael: Spoiler alert. [laughter] No, no.</p>
                        <p>02:58 Peter: It's the first time we've covered a majority opinion by our boy, Antonin Scalia, who is, I mean, let's be honest, he's gonna be a recurring character on the podcast.</p>
                        <p>03:08 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:09 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:10 Peter: He was nominated by Reagan to a spot on Supreme Court in 1986, and nominated by God to a spot in hell in 2016.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:21 Peter: So, he's most famous for popularizing textualism as a method of statutory interpretation, widely idolized on the right, primarily just because he's like a doctrinaire conservative, but also because he's very snarky and condescending in his writing, in a way that I think is very viscerally satisfying for the conservatives. I think this case is important because it highlights a couple of things about him along those very lines, one is that his commitment to textualism is perhaps a little more flexible than he might lead on, and two, is that when he steps outside of the subject he's most comfortable with, which is just like blatant homophobia, [laughter] he often comes across as a very mediocre intellect...</p>
                        <p>04:04 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:06 Peter: Who is not very impressive. And I think that cuts against not just the conservative perception of him, but the perception of him that we're all taught in law school. I don't know if you guys got the Antonin Scalia is borderline, a legal god...</p>
                        <p>04:18 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:19 Peter: Sort of spiel from law school, but it was prevalent for me.</p>
                        <p>04:23 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:24 Peter: And it took a little bit to kind of shake it.</p>
                        <p>04:27 Michael: Yup.</p>
                        <p>04:27 Peter: When you first realized he's sort of a moron, it's like an important step towards [chuckle] understanding the Court and the weird reverence of it.</p>
                        <p>04:35 Michael: There were a couple of moments I remember in law school very clearly and one was when I was interning for a judge after 1L and I read an opinion, and it was written by Thomas, and it was just so much better written than anything I had read from Scalia and everything you learn in law school is that Thomas is a crank.</p>
                        <p>04:52 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:54 Michael: And maybe not the most impressive justice and Scalia is the fucking intellectual Titan.</p>
                        <p>05:00 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:01 Michael: And I was like, "Wait a minute, actually this is the first time I've been impressed by one of these two guys and it's not Scalia." And then the other time was, as I mentioned in an FIB episode, which was when all these law professors were sure that Scalia was gonna rule in favor of ObamaCare and they were very wrong. [chuckle] And I do wonder how many, if any of them re-evaluated their prior held beliefs about his integrity and intellect after that.</p>
                        <p>05:26 Peter: Well, they will, when they hear our podcast.</p>
                        <p>05:28 Michael: That's right, if they have not yet. We are going to brow beat them into submission.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>05:35 Peter: That's right. We should get into the facts here, which I have to say, no joke are a little bit harrowing.</p>
                        <p>05:40 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:41 Peter: So, to help ease the facts into your brain, the soothing voice of Rhiannon, [chuckle] I think, it will be useful here.</p>
                        <p>05:52 Rhiannon: Okay, so up top, I just wanted to note for listeners up front that the facts of this case are really difficult. It's a horrific case and I wanna make sure that we treat this case with the care that it warrants, care that was clearly not afforded to this case, into the plaintiff by the highest and most powerful legal institution that we have in this country. For me, when I was prepping this case, I was thinking about how sometimes dealing with difficult facts like this, it means that I get with my two buds, Peter and Michael, and we laugh and we make fun of this stuff because it's a way to cope, and I think sometimes levity is a way of subtly undermining, just a little bit, the seriousness and the deference that we're supposed to give to the Supremes.</p>
                        <p>06:42 Michael: If we couldn't joke and laugh about it, I would punch a fucking hole in my wall. Like there's only two emotional states...</p>
                        <p>06:47 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>06:48 Michael: To be in with this and it's like angry, but laughing at the absurdity of it and maybe getting your anger out by being mean to the pieces of shit who signed onto this opinion or just raging out uncontrollably 'cause it's fucking awful. So...</p>
                        <p>07:07 Rhiannon: Right. Yeah, it makes me think too of Toni Morrison, I don't know if you guys have ever heard this, but Toni Morrison said that she started writing because she realized that she needed to be the one to write the books that she wanted to read. No one else was writing books that she wanted to read and so, she was like, "Fuck it. I'll do it myself," and so I look around and I kind of wanna make the podcast that no one else is making, and today that is a podcast episode where we rip apart the evilness and the stupidity that our legal system enacted on Jessica Gonzales in the wake of a tragedy that was absolutely preventable.</p>
                        <p>07:40 Peter: Oh yeah.</p>
                        <p>07:44 Rhiannon: So, the facts of the case, just a little bit of legal background and the statutory context, so VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act is passed in 1994 after really massive grassroots campaigns and organizing by women's rights groups and a broad network of organizations, including advocates for survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence, prosecutors and law enforcement agencies, etcetera. Throughout the '80s and early '90s, they're organizing and finally, VAWA gets passed, and VAWA is passed because local governments and these organizations are saying, we need guidance from the federal government to effectuate a justice structure, a justice mechanism that's responsive to what we're seeing on the ground, which are massive issues with domestic violence.</p>
                        <p>08:32 Peter: Yeah, so if anyone ever asks you when society, American society started to do anything serious about domestic violence, you can say 1994.</p>
                        <p>08:41 Rhiannon: Yes. [chuckle] Thank God for Joe Biden. [laughter] In the years immediately following the passage of VAWA, states and local governments adopt similar or even more protective statutes to try and address domestic violence in their jurisdictions. And so, it's in this legal context that Jessica Gonzales's case comes to the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>09:03 Rhiannon: So, what happened? It's May, 1999 and Jessica Gonzales obtains a temporary restraining order against her estranged husband, Simon Gonzales. This all happens in the town of Castle Rock, which is in Douglas County, Colorado. She obtains a temporary restraining order because she says that Simon has been acting erratically and violently. Even though they're split up, he has been stalking her, continuously stalking her and her three daughters, just violent and scary harassment behavior from Simon. So, the temporary restraining order says, "He shall not enter the family home and shall remain at least a 100 yards away from this location at all times." And in fact, the judge makes a special finding that goes into the temporary restraining order and that finding says that, "Physical or emotional harm would result if Simon was not excluded from the home." So, Jessica Gonzales has demonstrated a lot that her ex-husband is dangerous to her and her daughters.</p>
                        <p>10:08 Rhiannon: About 10 days later, after she gets the temporary restraining order, the restraining order is made permanent by the Colorado State Court and she's also granted sole physical custody of their three daughters. Simon Gonzales is permitted a pre-arranged mid-week dinner visit with the girls and alternate weekend visits, but otherwise they live with Jessica at their home. On June 22nd, just over two weeks after the restraining order is made permanent, Simon kidnaps the girls from their front yard, where they're playing, and at that point, when Jessica Gonzales realizes that her daughters are missing, she makes a first of many phone calls to the police at about 7:30 PM, and the police come over to the house.</p>
                        <p>10:56 Rhiannon: She shows them the restraining order and she asks that it be enforced. She says, "My daughters are missing. My ex-husband is dangerous and I want my kids to be returned to me immediately." In response to that, the police, true to the form that I know police to be operating on at all times, [laughter] are like, "Mmm, no can do. Let's just see if your crazy violent ex-husband brings them back by 10:00 PM."</p>
                        <p>11:25 Peter: Right. So, weird that the police would side with the abusive husband in that case. [chuckle] I wonder what's going on there.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:33 Rhiannon: So, the police leave her house. She gets a hold of Simon on his cell phone and he says that he and the girls are at an amusement park in Denver. She calls the police back and tells them, "This is where they are. They're at the amusement park. Here's a vehicle description. Please go look for them there. Please return my children to me." The police again say, "There is nothing we can do, ma'am. Wait and see if he comes back with them at 10:00 PM."</p>
                        <p>12:08 Michael: Kind of seems like there's something they could do. Just gonna throw it out there. You know, maybe...</p>
                        <p>[overlapping conversation]</p>
                        <p>12:15 Peter: You're thinking that they could maybe go to the amusement park?</p>
                        <p>12:20 Michael: Yes, and look for the car.</p>
                        <p>12:22 Rhiannon: I don't know. Maybe that's like fucking rocket science or something.</p>
                        <p>12:23 Peter: Interesting.</p>
                        <p>12:24 Michael: It's just a thought.</p>
                        <p>12:24 Rhiannon: Okay, so 10:00 PM comes and goes. At 10:10 PM, she calls the police again. This is her third call and says, "My children are still missing." At this point, she is told, "Ma'am, how about we wait till midnight then?"</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>12:42 Michael: Fuck these people.</p>
                        <p>12:44 Rhiannon: Getting absolutely no help from the police, she goes herself to Simon's apartment and realizes that nobody is there. At about midnight, she calls the police station again and she's told to wait for an officer to arrive, that an officer will be sent out to Simon's apartment to meet her there. Nobody ever shows up. So, she drives herself to the police station, arrives there at about 12:50 AM and she files an incident report on the spot. Now, the officer who took the incident report, this officer, you would think, "Okay. I just got all this information of a series of hours and phone calls and... "</p>
                        <p>13:19 Michael: Kids have been missing for half a day now.</p>
                        <p>13:22 Rhiannon: Right. Kids have been missing. Exactly. Well, that officer who took the report doesn't do anything, and in fact, this is noted in the opinion, he just went on break, I guess. And did his shift and went to dinner. So...</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>13:38 Peter: "Ma'am, I realize your kids are missing but it's 1:00 AM, I... "</p>
                        <p>13:40 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>13:41 Peter: "I'm gotta grab a bite to eat."</p>
                        <p>13:45 Rhiannon: Right. That's correct.</p>
                        <p>13:45 Peter: "It's eating time over here at the station."</p>
                        <p>13:46 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>13:47 Michael: The Denny's is open. [laughter] I got... My heart's set on Moons Over My Hammy.</p>
                        <p>13:52 Peter: "It's 5% off for police officers, ma'am... "</p>
                        <p>13:54 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>13:56 Peter: "So, I gotta be heading over there real quick."</p>
                        <p>13:57 Rhiannon: On the minute, they're gonna be at the fucking 24-hour diner for sure. [chuckle] Okay, so then a few hours later, 3:20 AM, Simon Gonzales drives to the police station and opens fire, on the building, at the police, with a gun that he purchased earlier that evening. A police shoot-out ensues, the police are shooting back at him and the result is that Simon Gonzales is killed. When the police go up to the car to the look over his body and investigate, they realize that the three girls are in the car and that they were already killed earlier by Simon.</p>
                        <p>14:38 Peter: Ugh.</p>
                        <p>14:39 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:41 Peter: So, Jessica Gonzales sues the state under Title 42, Section 1983 of the United States Code, the statute that allows individuals to sue the states for civil rights violations. What she alleges is that the police's willful failure to enforce the restraining order was a violation of her 14th Amendment right to due process.</p>
                        <p>15:05 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:06 Peter: The Due Process provision protects "life, liberty, and property." So, there's a question of whether the right to have a restraining order enforced, counts under the Constitution as a property interest, right? And what counts as a property interest under the 14th Amendment is pretty broad, it's not limited to tangible property.</p>
                        <p>15:23 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:24 Peter: The bottom line is that it's anything that a person would be entitled to. So, the Court, throughout this opinion is constantly referring to whether or not she has a property interest in the restraining order, but you can sort of ignore those semantics. The question is whether she's entitled under Colorado law to the enforcement of that restraining order.</p>
                        <p>15:43 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:45 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:46 Peter: And the relevant Colorado law is a 1994 bill designed to target domestic violence, in part by ensuring that police are compelled to enforce restraining orders. [chuckle] In this opinion, Antonin Scalia holds that Gonzales was not entitled to the enforcement of the restraining order, primarily because enforcement is generally considered to be optional for the police.</p>
                        <p>16:07 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:08 Peter: And therefore you can't be relied on as an entitlement by a citizen.</p>
                        <p>16:12 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:14 Rhiannon: Ugh.</p>
                        <p>16:16 Peter: And in addressing how incorrect that is, [laughter] I think it's important that we talk about the text of the Colorado law.</p>
                        <p>16:23 Michael: Yeah, I think that's a good place to start.</p>
                        <p>16:24 Peter: And the restraining order itself...</p>
                        <p>16:25 Rhiannon: Yes, that's important.</p>
                        <p>16:26 Michael: There's a really brilliant legal scholar by the name of Antonin Scalia [laughter] who tells us, "First go to the text, that's where we need to start."</p>
                        <p>16:35 Rhiannon: You gotta go to the text.</p>
                        <p>16:35 Michael: You gotta go to the text.</p>
                        <p>16:35 Rhiannon: The answers are gonna be right there.</p>
                        <p>16:39 Peter: So, the law says that police "shall use every reasonable means to enforce this restraining order." [chuckle] Now, I don't know how you guys read that, but to me that seems to suggest some sort of affirmative obligation on the police to enforce the order.</p>
                        <p>16:56 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:56 Peter: He uses the word, "shall" which is the word that God used in the Ten Commandments.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:02 Peter: So, I think that sounds pretty clear to me. There was also, it should be noted, some legislative history that's relevant here. The sponsor of the bill stated that under the law, "Police must make probable cause arrests." For these reasons, the court below had ruled in favor of Jessica Gonzales saying, "Of course, she's entitled to enforcement of the restraining order. It says so right here in the law." So, how does Antonin Scalia, the guy who thinks that the text of the law is the guiding light to its interpretation, who literally led a movement to centralize the text of the law in statutory interpretation...</p>
                        <p>17:38 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:40 Peter: Get around this extremely clear text? [chuckle] He does it by saying that the text can be ignored because there is "a well-established tradition" of police being able to choose whether or not they enforce the law.</p>
                        <p>17:55 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:57 Rhiannon: People think this guy is smart.</p>
                        <p>17:58 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>18:00 Peter: All right. [laughter] So, I don't wanna lose my cool too early in this episode.</p>
                        <p>18:05 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>18:05 Peter: He says that the tradition is well-established, but he doesn't really cite a lot, in support of that.</p>
                        <p>18:08 Michael: You expect a string cite of Supreme Court cases and circuit court cases and state supreme court cases, going back a 100 years or some shit, right?</p>
                        <p>18:20 Peter: Right. He doesn't cite a lot in support of it at all. In fact, he really just cites, I think one Supreme Court case. Again, the language is "that the police shall use every reasonable means to enforce this restraining order." And Scalia agrees that it's clear. What he's saying is, "Yeah, that seems to suggest that they have to do this, but we think that the history of police discretion in these matters outweighs what the text says." Literally the opposite of what he suggests doing...</p>
                        <p>18:49 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:50 Peter: In almost every other case.</p>
                        <p>18:50 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>18:50 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:50 Peter: I will say one thing though, before we move on to tearing his argument apart. If what he's saying is that there's a well-established tradition of police ignoring the plight of citizens, for no other reasons than their own laziness and selfishness, I completely agree.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:01 Rhiannon: You got it right.</p>
                        <p>19:03 Peter: He's right about that traditional.</p>
                        <p>19:06 Rhiannon: Yup. That's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:06 Peter: So, what he does is, play a series of what I think are just empty rhetorical games.</p>
                        <p>19:12 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:12 Peter: He says that the Supreme Court in the past has recognized that police officers have some discretion in these matters. And I think what he does, is conflate the issue of whether police have any discretion, with whether they have discretion under this law in this circumstance, to choose whether or not they feel like enforcing the restraining order.</p>
                        <p>19:30 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:31 Peter: You know, it's sort of obvious that police have some discretion, right? They have limited resources, right? You can only do so many things at once. They have to make decisions about their priorities, but that's not what's happening here. A situation where police did literally nothing, rather than take any steps to locate this woman's husband and her children, who he had kidnapped.</p>
                        <p>19:49 Rhiannon: Yeah. Right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>19:50 Michael: It's not a close case.</p>
                        <p>19:52 Peter: It's really not.</p>
                        <p>19:53 Rhiannon: No.</p>
                        <p>19:53 Peter: Although, this might be a good point to note that this is a seven to two decision.</p>
                        <p>20:00 Rhiannon: Yup.</p>
                        <p>20:00 Michael: [chuckle] Yes. Yes.</p>
                        <p>20:01 Peter: And we're gonna get into this in a minute, but...</p>
                        <p>20:01 Michael: Fuck all these people.</p>
                        <p>20:04 Peter: Breyer and Souter, two of these ostensibly liberal justices, are just outright terrible in criminal law cases, and this is a fucking great example.</p>
                        <p>20:13 Rhiannon: Yeah, and so Scalia pulls like another empty rhetorical little trick here, where he keeps saying that it can't possibly be required for police to arrest someone if they don't know where that person is, but that's not the question. The question isn't whether they have to arrest somebody, it's whether they have to take reasonable steps to arrest somebody.</p>
                        <p>20:35 Peter: Right, like the law says.</p>
                        <p>20:36 Rhiannon: Right. You can kind of argue about what that means in practice, and Scalia like kinda takes that argument up in the opinion, but it doesn't mean like going to dinner, it doesn't mean ending your shift and peacing out and not doing anything. So without going into every detail, a large part of the majority opinion here, or a large part of Scalia's treatment is predicated upon the obviously false premise that the police obligation in question is to arrest the person rather than doing what the law says, which is take reasonable steps to arrest a person.</p>
                        <p>21:11 Michael: Yeah, like maybe go to the fucking amusement park...</p>
                        <p>21:14 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>21:14 Michael: That he said he was at.</p>
                        <p>21:14 Rhiannon: Just see if his car is there, like that's, you know.</p>
                        <p>21:17 Michael: Yeah and it's... This is... Underlying all this is the fact that like look, even if you grant that there's a history of police discretion, like the entire fucking purpose of this statute is to eliminate that discretion to help combat violence against women and children. Right?</p>
                        <p>21:37 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>21:38 Michael: The reason this movement is happening in the '80s and '90s is not because domestic violence just appeared in 1978. It's been on for a while, the problem that's trying to be addressed here is that there's been no redress for victim of domestic violence up to this point, because cops don't take them seriously, those claims.</p>
                        <p>21:57 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>22:00 Peter: And there's something so obscene here because Scalia ignores the text, which he usually focuses on, and then he also ignores the intent of the law, so what else? If you want to change the law, are you supposed to do? You write the law that you have to reinforce restraining orders, you are doing it explicitly for that purpose, and the Court still says, "Well no, that's not how we're gonna interpret it, because you used to not have to do this." And it's such an important point because reactionaries on the court use history as a weapon.</p>
                        <p>22:32 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>22:33 Peter: And progressives are generally speaking, fighting against norms and traditions that they believe are inequitable, and the conservative position is not just that those norms and traditions are valuable, but that there is wisdom in tradition itself, and that wisdom is carried down through generations, and it manifests itself in modern norms. And this comes up in other context, Scalia has often argued, or I shouldn't say has often argued, often argued...</p>
                        <p>23:00 Rhiannon: 'Cause he did.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:04 Peter: Scalia often argued that gay rights are not constitutionally protectable because there's a long history of people disliking gay people in the United States. That with the fundamental argument under the 14th Amendment that he made, and here you have him saying that the long tradition of police doing whatever the fuck they want is so important that it outweighs the clear language and intent of a law, and as absurd and detached from history as it sounds, reactionaries in many ways believe that change itself is fundamentally dangerous.</p>
                        <p>23:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's absolutely right. They'll weaponized history in a very specific and intentional way. So just like when they're using legal rhetoric in a specific way, they're gonna use history in a way where there's a completely opposite argument for how history could be weaponized here to come out with the exact opposite result. But here, Scalia acts like, "Oh, you just look at history. And the result is obvious," but actually he's making a choice, he's choosing to see history as the one where police are given broad discretion, and so we shouldn't stray from that, but he's choosing not to think critically about the long history of women and children getting murdered by men, and the Colorado legislature trying to do something about that. But I guess the women and children murder is too important a tradition to Scalia to let go, I guess.</p>
                        <p>24:27 Peter: A long history of letting insane husbands rule over their family with the threat of violence. I mean that's...</p>
                        <p>24:33 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>24:34 Peter: What the actual history in play.</p>
                        <p>24:35 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>24:36 Peter: And I mean, we have, during various episodes of this podcast, talked about the use by the judges of doctrines and norms of statutory interpretation or constitutional interpretation, and why they're not real or why we don't believe they should be regarded as being useful. And this is a great example, because Scalia is the textual-ism guy. He is a guy who really took statutory interpretation and turned it into a methodical process where you look at the text first rather than the intent of the legislatures first. And he is completely ignoring it here for an incredibly hollow reason, and when a case like this drops it should be the fucking end of the discussion with respect to this man's intellectual integrity or consistency. And it just gets glossed over and it's so fucking frustrating to read this sort of thing, and when your law professor is teaching a class another case, they'll be like, "Well, Scalia's the textual-ist guy right?" And no, he's not, he just finds it useful in many of his cases, and he'll discard it when it's not.</p>
                        <p>25:46 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>25:47 Michael: In preparation for this case, I busted out my old legislation and regulation textbook, 'cause it's got a nice appendix where it's got all the rules of interpretation, statutory interpretation, and I was looking for one, but I found this other that I didn't even know I was in here, but this is a textual rule, a grammar and syntax rules, so this is like right in Scalia's wheel house. May, the word "May" is usually precatory and connotes decision-making discretion, while "shall" is usually mandatory and suggests less discretion.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:22 Michael: The question at the heart of this case was whether the word of "shall" granted police discretion.</p>
                        <p>26:30 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>26:30 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>26:32 Michael: And the dictionary, which Scalia loves, and the rules of statutory interpretation, that Scalia loves, I'll say that actually the word "shall" suggests no discretion, and Scalia says, "Well, that's not really what I think though."</p>
                        <p>26:43 Rhiannon: So I read this case in law school, twice actually for two classes. I read it for 14th Amendment and I read it for Civil Rights Litigation, and the way that it's taught, is just like, "This is or is not a procedural due process right. Here's the argument for why. That's the rule."</p>
                        <p>27:04 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>27:05 Rhiannon: There's no question of, "Wait a second, but isn't this completely anathema to what Scalia is known for, to what he says he's doing when he's interpreting legislation?" There's no critical treatment of it when we're discussing the case to fucking future lawyers and future judges.</p>
                        <p>27:20 Peter: Scalia makes another point, which I just wanna bring up quickly. It's a very technical point, but it's so stupid that I have to address it. He says that it's unclear whether the restraining order is a "property interest under the 14th Amendment, because most property interests have a readily ascertainable monetary value and this doesn't." And he doesn't really explain what he means by this, but this does have a readily ascertainable value. The value of a restraining order is roughly what it would cost you to hire a private company to enforce it, right? First of all, it's a real thing you can do.</p>
                        <p>27:50 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>27:54 Peter: Second of all, it's a real value. You can't just look at something like this, which is essentially a contract between this woman and the State and say, "Well, there's no way to put a price tag on that."</p>
                        <p>28:05 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>28:05 Peter: It's such a shallow, needless argument that he obviously gave very little thought to. It's less important than the point about police discretion, but it just goes to how fucking little he cares about this shit, when it comes to reaching the conclusion he wants to reach.</p>
                        <p>28:21 Rhiannon: Yeah, and how results-oriented it is, right? He has the conclusion first and is going to fashion whatever ridiculous legal argument for getting there.</p>
                        <p>28:31 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>28:32 Michael: It's also lovely, because early in the opinion, he quotes the dissent saying, "Look, the way the majority is coming out with this, is gonna render domestic abuse restraining orders utterly valueless," and he says, "That's hyperbole," calling this valueless is hyperbole."</p>
                        <p>28:47 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>28:48 Michael: But then he goes to great lengths to argue that. Well, it has no monetary value and it doesn't actually confer any meaningful rights on you, and you don't have any enforceable actions you can take against the police, but [chuckle] calling it valueless, that's ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>29:06 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:07 Rhiannon: That's a really good point, Michael.</p>
                        <p>29:07 Michael: Nothing or next to nothing from it, but...</p>
                        <p>29:09 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:09 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>29:10 Michael: But it's certainly not valueless.</p>
                        <p>29:12 Peter: Well, another thing we should talk about is that, conservatives love to talk about judicial restraint. But here was a great opportunity for them to make a very narrow holding, stating that, look, cops don't have to drop everything to enforce a restraining order, but this situation that played out right here is unconstitutional. It's below par.</p>
                        <p>29:30 Michael: It's too much.</p>
                        <p>29:30 Peter: Right, it's...</p>
                        <p>29:31 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>29:31 Peter: It's just a little too much of a failure. You can't go to dinner when someone is telling you that their kids were fucking kidnapped by their lunatic husband.</p>
                        <p>29:40 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:40 Michael: In violation of a restraining order.</p>
                        <p>29:42 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:43 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:43 Michael: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>29:43 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>29:43 Peter: And you could have said, "Look, it's limited to these facts. This isn't gonna apply to every restraining order," right? But the Court doesn't do that. The Court goes out of its way to say, "Look, cops don't owe you shit. [chuckle] I don't care if you got a contract with them or whatever. I don't care if you have a state ordered fucking piece of paper that says that they have to do this, they still don't." The Court goes out of its way to say that.</p>
                        <p>30:08 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>30:08 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>30:08 Rhiannon: Yeah. When I'm thinking about questions, I guess, of judicial restraint, I always like to look back at what it is the plaintiff was actually asking for and it's usually something really fucking reasonable, and you gotta ask like, "What is the harm in finding for her?"</p>
                        <p>30:23 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>30:24 Rhiannon: Like here, the complaint alleges, "Look, I believe I have this constitutional right. I was entitled to this benefit of enforcement of this restraining order. I didn't get it and so I would like to be able to sue." And the complaint says that like, "Once I'm able to sue, what I'll be able to show is that the city, the police actions were 'taken either willfully, recklessly or with such gross negligence as to indicate wanton disregard and deliberate indifference to her civil rights.'" That's it, it's just that they're indifferent. If you rule in her favor, what is the big slippery slope problem?</p>
                        <p>31:01 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:02 Rhiannon: She's not saying anybody should go to prison. She's not saying abolish the police. She's not saying arrest and kill every man. She's saying, "As to my case, these police officers were indifferent and now my fucking kids are dead and maybe you all should pay me."</p>
                        <p>31:17 Michael: Imagine if you made cops do their fucking job though.</p>
                        <p>31:21 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:23 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:23 Peter: I mean that really is...</p>
                        <p>31:23 Michael: If people could sue, if they didn't do their job?</p>
                        <p>31:26 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:26 Peter: That really, I think any step towards accountability and potential legal liability for police is just a step too far. They will not go down that path even a little bit and it doesn't matter how far you are from that slippery slope.</p>
                        <p>31:41 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>31:42 Peter: They are constantly eyeing it and they'll just never turn down it, period.</p>
                        <p>31:45 Rhiannon: That's right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>31:46 Michael: Yeah, it's like the last few sentences of the opinion is him saying like, "We don't want the 14th Amendment to turn into a font of Tort law."</p>
                        <p>31:51 Peter: Right. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>31:52 Michael: He doesn't want people suing under the 14th Amendment.</p>
                        <p>31:54 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:54 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:55 Michael: It's like, the states can do this if they want. The states can create this right. Apparently, even when they do it though, if they're not like fucking screaming in all caps...</p>
                        <p>32:05 Peter: Although the language, "shall use every reasonable means to enforce this restraining order," is in all caps on the restraining order.</p>
                        <p>32:13 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:18 Rhiannon: It's literally in all caps. Yes, that's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:20 Peter: On the sort of same topic of judicial restraint, there's also a sort of, what I view as a minor point, which is that, the real question here is, does Colorado law entitle Jessica Gonzales to enforcement of the restraining order? And that, in a lot of ways, should be a question for the Colorado Supreme Court. State supreme courts are supposed to be the authority on the interpretation of Colorado law.</p>
                        <p>32:48 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:48 Peter: Scalia brushes that aside and says, "Well yeah, but the real question is whether that right is a 14th Amendment protectable right."</p>
                        <p>32:57 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>32:57 Peter: And that sort of also dodges the point, which is that, you have to establish the right first and they could have certified that narrow question to the Colorado Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>33:04 Michael: Right. Yeah, there's this...</p>
                        <p>33:06 Peter: This is sort of like a technical bullshit that we don't care about too much, but it's worth noting for a couple of reasons. One is that again, they will weaponize these doctrines at their whim and then disregard the method in them.</p>
                        <p>33:20 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>33:21 Peter: The other, is that the dissent leads with it, as if that's like the most important point here, like, "Oh, we should really defer to Colorado on this issue."</p>
                        <p>33:31 Michael: Okay, got you guys.</p>
                        <p>33:31 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:31 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:31 Peter: Like, thanks dude, you really fucking bodied them with this one Stevens. This fucking woman's children are lying dead and he's like, "What does Colorado have to say about it?"</p>
                        <p>33:40 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:41 Michael: Scalia's got an answer to it. That like, it is good enough. It's persuasive enough. He's like, "Stevens, you fucking asked their counsel this at oral argument," and they were like, "No, we want the Supreme Court to take it."</p>
                        <p>33:55 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>33:55 Michael: If the party turned you down on it, look, maybe you're right, maybe this is the prudent and proper way to handle it, but fucking [chuckle] where are your priorities?</p>
                        <p>34:05 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>34:06 Peter: It's just more of the liberals trying to get them on fucking technicalities...</p>
                        <p>34:10 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>34:12 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>34:12 Peter: Rather than attacking the heart of the argument. And the heart of the issue here is that Scalia is fucking ignoring the text of this law.</p>
                        <p>34:21 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>34:21 Peter: And ignoring the intent of the people who passed the law just to fucking manufacture a mechanism for cops to avoid any responsibility and...</p>
                        <p>34:27 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:28 Peter: No, he doesn't call it out as such, even a little bit.</p>
                        <p>34:30 Michael: There are a number of different schools of thought on interpreting statutes, right? There's not just one or two, but there are two broader types and there's the text first and there's the purpose first, right?</p>
                        <p>34:45 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>34:46 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:46 Michael: Whether you're formalist or textualist or new-textualist or an intentionalist or purposivist or whatever, it doesn't really matter. The main point is that Scalia is ignoring the text, but he's also ignoring the purpose. He's like ignoring both.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Michael: Those are like your two load-stars. It's like one or the other.</p>
                        <p>35:04 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:05 Michael: You don't get to be like, "Whatever is in my fucking heart, whatever I believe."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>35:08 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>35:08 Michael: It's not one of the options for you.</p>
                        <p>35:10 Peter: Right. Goddammit. This one gets to me, it is really genuinely shocking even as people who are going through shitty Supreme Court decisions one after another, for this fucking podcast, to realize that this was a 7-2 decision.</p>
                        <p>35:26 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>35:27 Peter: It's just, it will break your fucking brain. It's emblematic of so many simultaneous problems with the Court that it's really hard for you to capture it.</p>
                        <p>35:34 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>35:34 Michael: Like Souter writes a concurrence and the second sentence in it, I think is really good, 'cause it accurately sort of describes what's going on in the majority opinion but it's just so perfect. He says, "The Court emphasizes the traditional public focus of law enforcement as a reason to doubt that these particular legal requirements to provide police services, however unconditional their form, presuppose enforceable individual rights to a certain level of police protection." And so what he's saying is cops always do public services. So, we shouldn't read too much to the fact that a law about cops is asking them to do public services, and maybe in some abstract sense that sounds right, but what the fuck is an order of protection? That's literally what these are called, orders of protection...</p>
                        <p>36:22 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:24 Michael: If not something, that includes an individual right to a certain level of police protection.</p>
                        <p>36:30 Peter: Right. If it's not that then what does it do?</p>
                        <p>36:32 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:32 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:33 Rhiannon: Then what's the point?</p>
                        <p>36:34 Peter: The bottom line is they think it's a suggestion, right? Like there's no other way to read it other than they're like, "Yeah, a restraining order, that's a thing that cops get, so that they know, that they wanna do this, they could."</p>
                        <p>36:45 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:45 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:45 Peter: It's just an optional thing that's presented to them and no matter what the circumstance is, that is obscene. That's so fuckin offensive.</p>
                        <p>36:53 Michael: The entire opinion is written from the frame that the purpose of this law was to empower police officers.</p>
                        <p>37:00 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:00 Michael: That's their built-in assumption that they don't state, but that is lurking in every little piece of logic in this, is that cops have discretion and statutes that pertain to them are about empowering them to use their discretion. But, this law was passed precisely because cops were not using their discretion appropriately in the domestic violence context. So, it's backwards. The history is bad, in order to read the text bad. Everything is bad. It's just fucking awful in order to leave this woman with nothing, whose kids were taken from her.</p>
                        <p>37:33 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. I think it's related, in the episode that we did on Terry v. Ohio, the stop-and-frisk. Peter, you talked about how police say there's a cost to doing their work, that they're always in danger and in order to do their work, basically what they're saying is we have to transfer the potential for danger and violence to the community onto all of us. And in Terry, the Court doesn't weigh the cost of doing that. What is the cost of letting police do whatever they want while the rest of us have weaker constitutional protections? But here I think the Court almost does do explicitly that kind of weighing. The Court says here, that the police should be able to sit on their asses and do nothing if they want to and the cost of that is dead children, and that's worth it, to let the police sit on their asses, if that's what the police want to do.</p>
                        <p>38:29 Peter: Right. I mean, actually, one wild thing about this is that, both the majority and the dissent say, "Look, these facts are terrible, but the real question doesn't need to address the facts." And it's like, no, actually, I think you do.</p>
                        <p>38:40 Rhiannon: Yeah, right.</p>
                        <p>38:40 Peter: I think you need to address the fact that this rule that you've just handed down can result in zero police liability for their unbelievable gross negligence that resulted in the murder of three children. It's not a separate fucking question.</p>
                        <p>38:55 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>38:55 Peter: And the fact that they have managed to reduce it to this incredibly technical sounding concept, which I don't actually think it's that technical, at the end of the day. The real issue is, is this woman entitled to some level of enforcement of this restraining order?</p>
                        <p>39:08 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>39:08 Peter: And they keep making it seem technical by being like, "Well, is it really a property interest? I don't know." And it's important to think about what the 14th Amendment actually says, which is that the state cannot deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. That's all it says, and all this technical discussion about property interests are just the framework the Court chooses to use. It could, if the political will were there, choose another framework and...</p>
                        <p>39:37 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>39:38 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:38 Peter: When a restraining order is issued, that means the state has agreed to enforce it, in my view. I don't think that's a weird thing to think.</p>
                        <p>39:44 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>39:46 Peter: It is not absurd at all to think that the 14th Amendment places an obligation on the state to enforce the restraining order to protect the life, liberty and property of people like Jessica Gonzales and her children. And it seems sort of on its face, like a colorable argument and the Court has twisted itself into this bizarre framework. And it's like Jesus Christ, like rest in peace to those kids, burn in hell, Antonin Scalia, you fucking piece of shit.</p>
                        <p>40:15 Michael: I mean like the type of fucking pretzels he ties himself into at some point is, he talks about how it's ridiculous to imagine that this has created some special class of protected citizens. Again, how could a fucking order of protection do anything but create a class of protected citizens?</p>
                        <p>40:38 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>40:38 Michael: What else could it possibly be?</p>
                        <p>40:39 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>40:41 Michael: What could it mean? And he could, he says, "Okay look, although Colorado's statute does speak of protected persons [chuckle] such as Jessica Gonzales, it does in a different context with different things, and so, sure, maybe it does create a protected class, but not in this narrow. Not in this narrative."</p>
                        <p>41:00 Rhiannon: He's so dumb. Can you imagine clerking for him? Like, I just...</p>
                        <p>41:05 Michael: You have to be a real piece of shit.</p>
                        <p>41:07 Rhiannon: Yeah, I mean you would be a piece of shit for sure. So, probably...</p>
                        <p>41:10 Peter: I would have turned it down for sure and I bet I would've... My grades would have totally gotten me there.</p>
                        <p>41:13 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>41:15 Rhiannon: Yeah, Peter conscientiously objected to applying to be a Supreme Court justice.</p>
                        <p>41:20 Peter: I stayed out of the top 10% of my class just to avoid having to deal with the clerkship options.</p>
                        <p>41:25 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>41:26 Peter: You know?</p>
                        <p>41:26 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's very honorable of you Peter.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>41:29 Peter: Alright. So, I think one of the broad implications of this is like, what rights do you have to any police action on your behalf? If a state order saying that the police will keep your husband 100 feet away from you at all times and arrest him if he's not. If that is not an obligation the cops have to you, then what obligations do they have to you?</p>
                        <p>41:54 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>41:56 Peter: And I think if we're looking within this 14th Amendment framework, I don't think that... If there's no obligation here, there's no obligation anywhere, under the 14th Amendment at least.</p>
                        <p>42:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah. I think that's right. I think this case put the kibosh on these types of claims. So, you might have the question, "Okay. Well, do I have the right to police action when I call 911? Do I have the right for police to act... " In all these different ways? But this case makes particularly clear that under the 14th Amendment, those kinds of claims are not gonna fly. Now, I think that one space in where you see maybe some recognition legally, of an affirmative duty for officers or state actors to protect, is in prison cases, in prison civil rights cases. But the context of prison is totally different, that's where the state has taken literally a person's liberty, kind of like the ultimate mechanism by which discretion is removed. You've taken all discretion away from a person and therefore the state is sort of obligated to protect to a higher degree, than people on the outside.</p>
                        <p>43:03 Michael: It's like an indictment of, I don't know, how impoverished our 14th Amendment law is, that a woman losing her children to her abusive ex-husband, despite ample opportunity for the police to do something, with notice, with a restraining order, is not considered any sort of deprivation of life, liberty or of property at any point. Like, how narrow are we thinking of those three concepts to think that that hasn't really happened here?</p>
                        <p>43:34 Peter: Yeah, it feels like it just has to be a disregard for the lives of the impoverished, right? Like, justices feel like having an abusive ex-husband is a problem that people like them don't have. I don't see any other way to look at the approach here, other than they view this as so distant from their lives, that it just doesn't resonate with them at all.</p>
                        <p>44:00 Michael: Or if they did have an abusive ex or whatever, or a crazy ex or however the case may be, if they called the cops, in their neighborhood, once the cops got through the gated security or whatever, they would take it very seriously, right? No, that's not a thing.</p>
                        <p>44:15 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>44:16 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:16 Peter: "Are you okay, Mr. Scalia? Please... "</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>44:18 Peter: Here's a glass of water. We've got you a giant bowl of Bolognese. Please just spoon it into your mouth while you wait for us to come and bring this to a resolution."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>44:30 Peter: So there's a weird thing here, where I'm sort of surprised. Ginsburg didn't write a dissent.</p>
                        <p>44:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:37 Peter: She usually hits in these sort of settings where the rights of women are particularly implicated. And she doesn't. I'm not sure why. I don't have any real insight into it. It could simply be that she thinks on the legal merits, that Stevens' point is the point that needs to be made. It could be that there's a class issue at play where she really doesn't relate to this as a gender issue, and it could be simply that she thinks that writing an opinion, like that's not productive and it's just gonna have her be dismissed as being shrill or whatever. There could have been an dissenting opinion here that was like, "Hey, you know, the vast majority of the victims of domestic violence are women. The vast majority of the perpetrators of domestic violence are men. Vast majority of cops are men," and made this very gendered, because it is very gendered. But she didn't wanna do it for one reason or another.</p>
                        <p>45:33 Michael: It can't be emphasized enough how fucking weak this dissent is. You shouldn't be able to read through a single paragraph of this without hearing Stevens call out Scalia's bullshit. Stevens does the textual analysis that Scalia does not. A standard textual technique is to look at other parts of the act and see how they use similar language and handle similar situations, and he says like, "Look, there are other parts of the statute where they're able to afford police discretion clearly." And so the fact that they didn't use that language here, they used more mandatory sounding language is clearly a purposeful choice. That's a normal technique of textualism and Stevens could and should be saying... Citing to Scalia opinions on this point, right? Like, "As Justice Scalia has said," and he should be saying shit like, "Another example of Justice Scalia's fair weather appreciation of the primacy of the text..."</p>
                        <p>46:35 Rhiannon: Yeah. Hypocrisy, right.</p>
                        <p>46:35 Michael: You should be calling him a fucking hypocrite. You should be calling him out for being intellectually shallow. You lost this fight, it's 7-2. Your dissent is not gonna do anything. All you can accomplish with this is de-legitimize the majority. And you have a great opportunity. This is a fucking meatball down the middle of the plate. You should kill this.</p>
                        <p>46:58 Peter: Yeah. It's because he's acting like he's arguing against an idea and not a person. And you need to be able to understand and present an argument that accepts that what you're arguing against is someone who has biases and ideology and preferences, political and otherwise, and make him confront his hypocrisy here. I'm not saying it would change Scalia's opinion. I doubt it would, but make him look at it and make him address it and make readers of the opinion of your dissent aware of it. And he doesn't do it, he acts like the ideas just float out of Scalia's mind free form and not like they're being presented by an insanely ideological person.</p>
                        <p>47:40 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>47:41 Peter: We obviously make a lot of jokes in this podcast, and it's a big part of it, but we want, especially in this case, to sort of center the very human experience of Jessica Gonzales.</p>
                        <p>47:53 Rhiannon: Yeah, like I said at the top, I really wanted to be able to treat Jessica Gonzales and her children in this episode with care. And when you look up Jessica Gonzales actually, she's dedicated her life since this case to pursuing a lot of reform to protect survivors of domestic violence and police reform and that kind of thing. And so I think we can wrap this episode up actually by highlighting some of Jessica Gonzales's words. So in an interview, she was asked why she fought this case all the way to the Supreme Court, and she said this, "Because I wanna make sure that no parent ever has to go through the pain that I went through. I wanna make sure that police are ultimately accountable for doing their jobs. We rely on the courts and the police for protection against violence. A restraining order is the only legal alternative offered for protection against domestic violence. Supposedly police function is to serve and protect. If the law's claimed purpose to protect is a fraud, we should know that. If the police will take no action to enforce an order of protection, then women need to know this before we go through the process and make our stalker or abuser even angrier."</p>
                        <p>49:07 Peter: Amen.</p>

                        <p>49:15 Peter: Okay, so next episode is Kelo v. The City of New London, a case about eminent domain, the right of the government to seize your property and just give you the fucking middle finger about it, and a very unique case because we will be opposing the liberal majority.</p>
                        <p>49:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, they suck ass too.</p>
                        <p>49:37 Peter: We hate them all. It's a bad decision.</p>
                        <p>49:39 Michael: It's terrible.</p>
                        <p>49:40 Peter: And the liberals are bad, and we're smarter than them too.</p>
                        <p>49:42 Rhiannon: Yep.</p>

                        <p>00:10 Peter: Folks, welcome to an emergency broadcast of 5-4. I am Peter, here as the law boy, I am here with Michael...</p>
                        <p>00:20 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>00:22 Peter: And Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>00:22 Rhiannon: Hi. Fuck the Supreme Court, hi.</p>
                        <p>00:24 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>00:25 Peter: Yeah. And we are here to talk about the aptly-titled RNC v. DNC, the case dropped by the Supreme Court just a couple of days ago on Monday, April 6, concerning Wisconsin's elections.</p>
                        <p>00:46 Michael: I don't want to step on you really quick, but just for our less politically-minded listeners, if we have any, RNC is the Republican National Committee and the DNC is the Democratic National Committee, just so we're clear.</p>
                        <p>00:57 Peter: Right. Also, thanks for listening.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:02 Peter: Very fascinating. So this comes down 5-4 along the usual lines. The elections in question, are in Wisconsin, Democratic primary going on in various statewide and local races, including a race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, an elected position in Wisconsin. Wisconsin statewide elections occurred Tuesday, April 7th. Absentee ballots were due to be received that same day. However, given the ongoing COVID crisis, the DNC and some community organizations and voters applied for a preliminary injunction extending the deadlines about a week for absentee ballots. On April 2nd, the District Court issued an order allowing, among other things, the counting of all absentee ballots as long as they were received by April 13th, a six-day extension of the deadline, and the Court also held the Wisconsin Elections Commission could not release results until the 13th.</p>
                        <p>02:10 Peter: So the Republican National Committee filed for a stay of that order with the Seventh Circuit, the appellate court, who declined it. They then applied to the Supreme Court, who granted it, and held that absentee ballots would only be accepted if they were postmarked by April 7, the day after the decision. And this caused a bit of a stir due to the fact that it is reducing absentee voting in the middle of a global pandemic, the likes of which no one alive has ever seen.</p>
                        <p>02:51 Michael: There are literally people who've requested and not yet received absentee ballots in Wisconsin.</p>
                        <p>02:55 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>02:56 Peter: Yep, yep, and the primary reasoning used by the Court here is that the injunction violates a principle established in the 2006 case Purcell v. Gonzalez, that lower courts "should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election." And I cannot fucking express how fundamentally stupid the reliance on this principle is here. First of all, the principle is that ordinarily lower courts should not alter election rules near an election, which inherently, I think, means that in extraordinary circumstances, a court might be able to. And the court doesn't even investigate this concept a little bit, it acts as if it's like a hard and fast rule, like, Sorry, you can't... The court can't mess with election rules on the eve of an election. Doesn't investigate a little bit what the boundaries of this rule might actually look like.</p>
                        <p>03:58 Peter: And my theory, my position, and I think, not to speak for you guys, but maybe the position of this podcast, that if a global pandemic doesn't qualify as extraordinary circumstances for these purposes, then nothing does. It's fucking ludicrous, and I can't tell you how little time the Court spends thinking about this, and they just breeze past it like it's this impenetrable rule. It's just a fucking stupid principle they borrow out of a case from 15 years ago and act like this is like... This is the will of God.</p>
                        <p>04:36 Rhiannon: Right. And you know what, I've been preoccupied with this shit all day long with John Roberts' bullshit, and the biggest injustice to me about this case is that I am on a podcast and yet on the podcast, I can't tell Chief Justice John Roberts to fucking pull up. And if I need to... He's lucky I don't fucking live in DC, because I can't say on this podcast that if I lived in DC and I saw him, it would be fucking on-site because Justice Roberts needs his ass kicked. He needs his ass kicked, but I can't say that on this fucking podcast, and I think that's extremely unjust.</p>
                        <p>05:17 Peter: And that's your notice, John Roberts, please pull up. If you're listening to this podcast... Rhiannon, please try to say things that we can keep in the podcast.</p>
                        <p>05:37 Michael: Look, the entire point of not intervening in elections in the last minute is according to Purcell itself to reduce voter confusion, which risks like disenfranchising or discouraging turn-out. But here, reinstating a prior deadline on the literal eve of the election achieves the opposite ends, like...</p>
                        <p>06:02 Peter: Insanely confusing.</p>
                        <p>06:04 Michael: More confusing and makes it harder to vote, making it less likely a lot of people vote.</p>
                        <p>06:10 Peter: Yeah, not to mention that the actual rule here was confusing enough that although it's like a three-page decision by the Roberts Court, we had to have a 20-minute conversation before... Before the podcast started to get it straight. It's very convoluted, and we won't get into this super gritty details about what exactly is going on here, but the Roberts Court was like making up rules about postmarking as opposed to the date that something needs to be... An absentee ballot needs to be received. It's all very convoluted and hard to follow, and we're trying to follow it. If you're just a fucking voter in Wisconsin, you're hopeless.</p>
                        <p>06:48 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I think our girl, Ruth, our girl, Ruth, she does a pretty good job at responding to this in the dissent, so Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is writing in dissent, and she basically says like, look, the District Court was responding to obviously an extremely rapidly changing public health crisis, and if intervening so close to the election is a problem, then the Supreme Court doing it even closer to the election, that's more of a problem. And really, that's it. That's the way to distill it.</p>
                        <p>07:24 Peter: Obviously true. And Roberts just said like, yeah, but we had to, because the District Court intervened. But like the District Court intervened in the middle of a fucking global pandemic six days prior to the election, something along those lines, five days prior to the election, and obviously, all you're doing is making it more confusing, and if your concern is actually the confusion of the voters, then you might just say, well, look, this was a little bit confusing, but there's nothing better to do here, which I think is what the Court had to do, right.</p>
                        <p>07:55 Michael: Right, like the whole principle, the Purcell principle is just that you don't want to change the circumstances of an election. But here the circumstances are changing, no matter what, like that's it.</p>
                        <p>08:05 Peter: Yes. You can't pretend the fucking pandemic isn't happening.</p>
                        <p>08:10 Michael: Right, in brass tacks terms, like in Milwaukee, which has almost like a fifth of the state's population, I think 16% of the state's population, something like that. They typically have 180 polling locations. They have five. They have five for this election, it's like... It's almost zero. That is pretty fucking close to none, because they couldn't find poll workers.</p>
                        <p>08:35 Peter: So the court says that this is a "narrow technical question," and I genuinely wonder if they understand what the word technical means, because a proper evaluation of this standard would involve weighing the interests on both sides on, one, the principle of avoiding interference in state elections; on the other, the negative impact on the election itself of prevent of... Like the chaos ensuing from allowing an election to proceed in circumstances where there's a global pandemic where voting it gonna be massively suppressed; and again, the Court doesn't weigh the interests at all, right? And like I mentioned, if the law says... If the law said that courts could never intervene in state elections, that would be a narrow and technical rule, right, but what's really happening here is that the rule is quite flexible and holistic, the rule is saying ordinarily courts should not interfere with elections, and whether something is ordinary or not is not a technical question. Sorry, I know that the conservatives love to find a technicality, but this just isn't one.</p>
                        <p>09:48 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I think the majority opinion, which is... It's per curiam, right?</p>
                        <p>09:53 Peter: Yes.</p>
                        <p>09:55 Rhiannon: So the majority opinion, which is per curiam, which means that nobody signs on to the majority opinion to say this is the one Justice that's writing it, but something the majority says is that the nature of an election is altered because you change the deadline to vote, and this is how we know that formalism isn't a prescriptive intellectual framework, it's a tool and they weaponize it. The conservatives weaponize it, right? So they act like they're obsessed with a deadline here, like they were in Bush v. Gore, if you remember the Supreme Court one time just decided who the fuck was gonna win a presidential election for all of us. And on the one hand, the conservatives, like they can and they will do absolutely everything in their power to entrench political power in their party, they'll suppress votes, they will gerrymander the shit out of districts, they will gut the Voting Rights Act. Right, and they'll turn around and say to your face at the same time that what's important about elections is actually just the day that it happens, but like, bitch, it's not fucking Christmas. The nature of an election is not altered because you change the deadline to vote, the nature of elections is that people fucking vote, they can vote. That's what an election is.</p>
                        <p>11:09 Peter: The Court also talks about how election results would effectively begin to leak, meaning that if the election is sort of ongoing from the 7th through the 13th and absentee ballots are still allowed, election results would begin to get out, right, exit polling or whatever it might be would get out, and that would jeopardize the integrity of the election, because people would be sending their ballots having seen the early results. Does a dissent actually sort of assumes that this is true. I think they rightfully say that it's stupid, but they do sort of assume that it's true on its face, I don't actually think it's true on its face. I don't see why that would jeopardize the integrity of an election. It seems to me like people having more information about an election as they vote would do the opposite.</p>
                        <p>12:00 Peter: And again, they don't engage with the other side of this, which is that eliminating absentee ballots past a certain date and maximizing in-person voting during a fucking viral pandemic, obviously also jeopardizes the integrity of an election.</p>
                        <p>12:18 Rhiannon: Absolutely. And I think actually, regardless of whether or not exit polling or early results being released would affect the election, I think like the District Court dealt with that by just by ordering results not to be released until the 13th, right. The whole fucking argument of the risk of exit polling and early results being released and that jeopardizing the integrity of the election, that reminds me a lot of Bush v. Gore, where they said that the recount couldn't move forward in conjunction with the requirements of equal protection without substantial additional work. Remember that? Bush was like, "Do the work then." The District Court did the work, so there's this risk and we can mitigate it by doing this. Okay.</p>
                        <p>13:07 Michael: Right. They act like it's like a big hardship, like, oh, it's involving third parties not party to this law suit posing requirements on them and shit, but it's like there's a fucking memo from the Head of Elections in Wisconsin that's like, "Look, you can't release the results," and you distribute it, and that's whatever. It's done. They were ready to go.</p>
                        <p>13:29 Rhiannon: Right, right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>13:31 Peter: So, the majority spends the end of the decision being defensive about its own position, the majority's position, and they say this: "The Court's decision on the narrow question before the Court should not be viewed as expressing an opinion on the broader question of whether to hold the election or whether other reforms or modifications and election procedures in light of COVID-19 are appropriate. That point cannot be stressed enough." And it's like first of all, like we said, the question before the Court was not narrow, they're just making it narrow.</p>
                        <p>14:05 Peter: It's a broad and nuanced question its holding both directly disenfranchises tens of thousands of people and puts tens of thousands more at risk of getting a fucking virus that is ravaging this country and the rest of the world. I mean, look, this is sort of a doth protest too much situation, when the Court says something like this, you sort of know that they realize in some part of their brain that they're fucking up and they're like, "I can't express enough how much we're not trying to address COVID-19."</p>
                        <p>14:40 Peter: And this is the only time they mention it in the fucking majority opinion. They don't even talk about the reason that the injunction was requested, which is because of COVID-19. And Ginsburg's dissent, as usual, we said this in Shelby County, but this time she does it explicitly, it's perfect, except that she refuses to question the good faith of the conservative majority, and in this case, she explicitly says that she does not doubt their good faith.</p>
                        <p>15:13 Rhiannon: It's un-fucking believable. It is un-fucking believable.</p>
                        <p>15:17 Peter: I saw a couple of people say, "Maybe she's being tongue-in-cheek here," and I guess, first of all, it just doesn't read like that to me; second of all, it would be very weird to be tongue-in-cheek after a fucking entire career of taking this exact position very sincerely.</p>
                        <p>15:37 Rhiannon: Right. I know you want your queen to be like throwing shade or whatever, but no, she's actually just...</p>
                        <p>15:43 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>15:44 Rhiannon: This is actually just how she is.</p>
                        <p>15:44 Peter: Right. And the other argument I saw was, look, and you see this all the time in these discussions, but look, she's debating this stuff with these people every day, she's got dozens of cases with them, she doesn't want to kind of fall out of favor. And I guess my question would be, when do you think she's gonna fucking convince them, right? When is her charm and her refusal to call them out going to actually reap some rewards, because she's fucking 87 and it's not happening now. This is a situation where there is no reasonable way to come to the conclusion that the majority did. I'm sorry, there isn't. And whatever hack professors you see spouting off on Twitter about how this is actually very reasonable and it was a narrow technical question: Morons! Morons not interested in finding the truth, not interested in an interpretation of the law that makes practical sense for the people who live under it and whose lives are dictated by it, flat out. Look, we don't need to pretend that we don't know why the RNC intervened in this case and why the five conservatives just so happen to be on the side of voter suppression in every single significant case that comes before them, right?</p>
                        <p>17:06 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:08 Peter: The Republican party exists as a relevant party in this country because of its ability to suppress the votes of the opposition. Not only is there ongoing voter purging, but in 2018, Democrats won the majority of the votes for State Assembly in Wisconsin; thanks to gerrymandering, Republicans won 65% of the seats to the Democrats' 35%.</p>
                        <p>17:34 Michael: It's not a democracy. You can't call it a democracy.</p>
                        <p>17:37 Peter: It's not. It's not. It is inherently a violation of whatever you might conceive of as the right to vote in this country. And I've talked about this on Twitter too, the Republican Justices, they themselves know that their own power is attributable to voter suppression efforts by the RNC and all of its affiliates, and this is their fucking thank you letter to them, and them acknowledging that there is no way for them to maintain power other than disenfranchisement of their opponents.</p>
                        <p>18:09 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's exactly right. And so just to highlight that point with some numbers out of Wisconsin, so like Michael said up top, the city of Milwaukee, for instance, is down from originally having 180 polling places, now to 5. And just to give some demographic information, so the population of Milwaukee is 26% black; however, that actually comprises 67% of all of Wisconsin's black voters, they live in Milwaukee, and that is layered with 97% of the polling places in that city having been shut down. So when you're talking about voting rights here, obviously and always talking also about a racial justice issue in this country, and then to layer on another sort of exacerbation, we are in the middle of a global pandemic, and 81% of the people who have died from COVID-19 in Milwaukee are black people.</p>
                        <p>19:09 Rhiannon: And so when you're telling people that voting is going to be this much harder, but you definitely have to do it in person or else your vote isn't going to count, but also you're putting your literal life at risk to do so, you're talking about massive problems with racial justice that are just fucking unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>19:31 Michael: Like we said at the top, in addition to the Democratic primary, there are some statewide elections on the ballot, a number of them, actually, but one that's particularly important is the Wisconsin State Supreme Court. And that's a big deal because so much right now relies for Republican control on their gerrymander, on their... Giving them a big majority in the legislature and a majority in the Supreme Court that will rubber stamp all their legislative bullshit, which they have engaged in a lot of.</p>
                        <p>20:07 Peter: I do want to get one point out here that I think is... It might be a little bit redundant, but the real question is, you have to ask yourself in these cases, especially a case like this is, what was the Supreme Court actually trying to accomplish here? Because if what they were trying to accomplish was to uphold the standard that was established in this Purcell case, that lower courts should not intervene in elections at the last moment, then you would think that it would have spent some time on why it was doing so and what the real value was. Instead, instead, what you see is an opinion that's incredibly defensive, that has almost no affirmative reasoning, and instead just sort of responds to the dissent to try to swipe it away, and if there was a real case to be made, they would have made it.</p>
                        <p>21:03 Peter: The fact is that there really isn't. All they can do is try to present this as a technical question, like we said, and pretend that it is one, and then just sort of close... Shut their ears and tell everyone to fuck off and wait until the fervor dies down. And this is a statement that they don't care about making an affirmative case, that they don't need to... They have a five Justice majority, and that's the end of it.</p>
                        <p>21:33 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>21:34 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>21:38 Peter: Alright, that's it for our emergency pod. I hope you guys enjoyed us rambling about this without any preparation, this is what it sounds like, this is what us just wilding out the next day sounds like. So if this was terrible, just let us know. We'll be sure to respond appropriately.</p>

                        <p>[background conversation]</p>
                        <p>00:31 Leon Neyfakh: At issue was the President's Executive Order restricting travel to the United States for citizens of five majority Muslim countries.</p>
                        <p>00:39 Announcer: Airport servicing international flights across the country were flooded with protesters yesterday after Visa and green card holders were denied entry.</p>
                        <p>00:46 Leon Neyfakh: The Muslim ban, as Trump had described it on the campaign trail, became a major test of whether the Supreme Court would serve as a meaningful check on the new president. This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:06 Peter: Alright, welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have eaten away at this nation, like termites in our floor boards.</p>
                        <p>01:16 Rhiannon: That's a good one. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Peter: Thank you. I am Peter, Twitter's The Law Boy, and we are recording from Coronavirus quarantine. So I am in my girlfriend's closet, and from a separate closet across New York City, we have Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:36 Michael: That's right, I'm in my own closet.</p>
                        <p>01:37 Peter: And from a studio and a part of the country that is apparently not worried about this at all, Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:42 Rhiannon: Hey guys. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:47 Peter: Look, as we've said on Twitter, we're never gonna stop production. It doesn't matter if some of us die...</p>
                        <p>01:52 Rhiannon: Oh god.</p>
                        <p>01:53 Peter: No matter what, I don't care what happens to this country, we are going to be just shoving this podcast down our listeners' throats for months to come.</p>
                        <p>02:04 Rhiannon: Well, that's why we're contractually obligated.</p>
                        <p>02:07 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:09 Peter: That's right. We have no choice. A few months ago, I was like, "Oh, I should have a podcast", and now I'm in my girlfriend's closet in the middle of a global pandemic.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>02:21 Peter: So today, we are covering Trump v Hawaii, better known as the travel ban or the Muslim ban case, where the Supreme Court in a 5-4 ruling upheld the validity of the Trump administration's proposed restrictions targeting predominantly Muslim countries. This case highlights a couple of important things; how incredibly deferential the Roberts Court has been to the Trump administration, a trend that has started to gain some public attention in the recent last few months. And another is the massive disparity in the treatment by the courts of the rights of groups it favors and groups it does not. And together, these have sort of combined to allow the court in this case to almost completely disregard the fact that Trump openly touted the travel ban as a Muslim ban, and accept on its face, the administration's claim that the ban was in fact a matter of national security concern. So, some of you may recall that as a candidate for president and following the San Bernardino attacks, Donald Trump stated that he was calling for, "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:40 Peter: And at the time, some commentators thought that maybe this suggested a bias against Muslims. Yeah, and these are fire brand commentators. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>03:53 Rhiannon: [chuckle] Yeah. Liberal elite, politically correct, losers.</p>
                        <p>03:57 Peter: Right. And legal commentators pointed out that such a policy would likely run afoul of several amendments to our constitution. Notably the first one with its promise of freedom of religion.</p>
                        <p>04:09 Michael: Yeah, that's a big one.</p>
                        <p>04:11 Peter: It's right up top. And people were concerned, and I just, I [chuckle] wanna note that the phrase, "until we can figure out what is going on" has always been incredibly funny to me, because it implies that at some point in the future, there might be like a eureka moment concerning what's going on with Muslims, and after we figure it out, they're allowed to come again.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:38 Rhiannon: Well, no, as someone with a Muslim family, maybe it's time to tell you guys, there's something going on with us and you'll find out. Stay tuned.</p>
                        <p>04:47 Peter: Yeah, I bet we will. [chuckle] So Trump dials the language down, right, as the election cycle goes on. I guess his lawyers sit him down, like Rudy Giuliani sits him down and is like, "We can't ban them all, so we're gonna have to do something else," in what must have been just an unbelievably lengthy conversation with Donald Trump. [chuckle] They're like, "But we can ban a bunch of Muslims. Don't worry, dude, we're gonna do it. We just have to change the language." And so they stopped saying Muslim ban, they start saying extreme vetting, and things like that. And I wanna point out that conservatives have taken a pretty hard line on the Muslim issue since 9/11, especially. It was very weird to see it coalesce so openly, and almost refreshing. It was simultaneously terrifying and refreshing to see them just talk about it like you imagine they must at every dinner party or whatever. So Rhi, do you wanna take us through some of the background here?</p>
                        <p>05:54 Rhiannon: Sure thing. Always happy to. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>06:01 Peter: Are you okay? What was that?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:04 Michael: Is that a symptom?</p>
                        <p>06:06 Peter: Oh, shit.</p>
                        <p>06:07 Rhiannon: That's just me clearing my throat. So yes, the bowl of disgusting moldy macaroni and cheese, Donald Trump, on January 27th, 2017, he hands down the first of a couple of executive orders. And this first one suspends for 90 days the entry of Nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia Sudan, Syria and Yemen. And y'all, surely you remember the airport protests at that time? So this executive order came down, it was amazing actually how quickly people were mobilized and how quickly airports became the center of this mobilization. Yeah, so there were protests at the airports almost immediately, and also almost immediately, what quickly follows that first executive order is a legal challenge. So it's quickly challenged in the courts and an injunction preventing the implementation of the order is also quickly in place.</p>
                        <p>07:05 Michael: Yeah, we've talked about injunctions before, but that's basically a District Court saying, in this case, that the Federal Government can't do what they're trying to do here. They're enjoined from enacting the travel ban...</p>
                        <p>07:20 Peter: Right. And I have to interject with an anecdote here that I read at the time, which was that the injunction came down, people are protesting at the airports, and TSA and all their cohorts, they're holding people in the airports, and they're still doing it after the injunction comes down maybe 12 hours later, and someone was like, "On whose authority are you doing this?" And one of the agents responded, Donald J. Trump.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:49 Rhiannon: My god. That's so fucking embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>07:51 Peter: It really is, it really is. But you have to keep in mind, they've never felt that kinda power before, they've been waiting their whole life to keep Muslims out.</p>
                        <p>08:00 Rhiannon: Yeah, they were amped up. It finally felt again like that first crystal meth high that they had in high school. [laughter] They were like, "Yes!" [laughter] Okay, so on March 6th, 2017, the administration rescinds their first order and they replace it with a second, which is functionally the same but it removes Iraq from the listed countries, and so new legal challenges again quickly materialize and injunctions are put in place to this second executive order, and the Supreme Court actually partially allows the order, but says that people with connections to the US can still come in and the order expires before it can basically make it up to the court again. So then on September 24th, 2017, Trump issues the final iteration of the travel ban, which puts restrictions on entry into the US by nationals from Chad, Chad is now on the list, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.</p>
                        <p>09:05 Peter: Noticing something about that list? They threw a couple of non-Muslim countries in there.</p>
                        <p>09:11 Michael: Right. [chuckle] We got one of the axis of evil countries there, North Korea...</p>
                        <p>09:14 Rhiannon: Yeah, harkening back to the great era of George W. Bush...</p>
                        <p>09:18 Michael: Fascists of yore.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:24 Rhiannon: So yes, if you're paying attention, the final iteration of the travel ban includes some non-Muslim countries. The reason provided for these restrictions was to support, "Foreign policy, national security and counter-terrorism by excluding inadequately vetted foreign nationals and motivating other nations to improve their vetting practices." So the stated reason is that these countries don't do a good enough job at vetting who is leaving the country.</p>
                        <p>09:56 Peter: Yeah, if someone's gonna leave your country you gotta check them out, "Are you good enough to go to America?" [laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:01 Rhiannon: Right, [laughter] yeah, so that's what the purported reason is, but again if you'll notice, they've added some non-Muslim countries to the list and this is almost certainly an effort to anticipate the argument that the order is unconstitutionally targeting Muslims and would be a violation of the First Amendment. So the plaintiffs here, with this iteration, the final iteration of the travel ban, the plaintiffs here challenge the law on a number of grounds but primarily on the basis that, first of all, the ban violates the INA, the Immigration and Nationality Act. And second of all, that the ban violates the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which protects freedom of religion, of course. And we are going to spare you the drudgery of talking about the INA, the Immigration and Nationality Act, because it sucks, and immigration law sucks, and we're gonna focus on the constitutional arguments and the Establishment Clause issue.</p>
                        <p>11:03 Peter: Absolutely right. If someone asks you if the Robert Court was right on the statutory question here, just ignore it and move on, 'cause it's too boring. And I personally couldn't even make my way through it, I was like, "Let's just go straight to the constitutionality of the Establishment Clause."</p>
                        <p>11:18 Michael: Like a host on West World when somebody mentions the outside World...</p>
                        <p>11:21 Peter: Doesn't look like anything to me.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:24 Michael: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>11:25 Peter: Alright. So, let's talk about the relevant law a little bit. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. And there's a dispute between the majority and the dissent in this case about the appropriate standard of review, the dissent says that it's whether a reasonable person would perceive the executive order as being intended to dis-favor Muslims. And the majority can't accept that standard because there's no way that the Trump administration could win on that standard, you'd have to be a moron to think that their intent was anything other than to exclude Muslims. So the majority avoids the application of that more stringent standard, mostly by just disregarding the mountains of evidence of Trump's animus toward Muslims, and then giving enormous amounts of undeserved credence to the clearly fake and pre-textual reasons for the ban, all the national security reasoning that they put in there.</p>
                        <p>12:29 Peter: So I don't wanna dwell for too long on the standard of review and we've talked about this in the past, it's, they're arbitrary and fake and there's no reason to dig in too deep but the dissent points out that a higher level of scrutiny is appropriate where there is clear evidence of discriminatory motive and to me that almost certainly has to be correct and if the court does not examine a situation where the government has openly fashioned a policy out of a desire to ban Muslims from entering the country more closely than it would any other policy then why even have a higher standard, what's the point of having these different standards if you can't examine more closely someone like Trump going on psychotic rants about Muslims for months on end and you can't just bust out your fucking magnifying glass and take a look at that.</p>
                        <p>13:21 Peter: So the first thing that the majority opinion does and it's all the usual suspects in the majority, you've got Roberts writing at Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch and Kennedy. One of the last things he did before the Federalist Society walked him out the back [laughter] he told the kids that he was going off to play on a farm so the first thing the decision does is kinda go on and on about the executive branches' discretion in matters of national security. Now we talked about this in the states' rights context and it's the same sort of thing but judges will do this a lot when they're dodging the fundamental question, the question is not does the Executive Branch have broad national security powers the question is whether this order violates the Establishment Clause of the first amendment, no matter how broad the President's authority is with respect to national security you cannot by law violate the First Amendment.</p>
                        <p>14:19 Peter: So any discussion of the general National Security power is in my view mostly a distraction. The one thing I'll say about it is that sometimes the nature of governing calls for flexibility in these regards, we've talked about this in the speech context but there's a case to be made that the content and context of speech for example, needs to involve the weighing of the government's interest against the value of the speech but that sort of flexibility is in my view much less applicable in this context and the idea that we might have to allow the government some leeway to discriminate against Muslims for national security reasons is I think maybe the exact reason the Establishment Clause is in place to begin with.</p>
                        <p>15:01 Michael: Yes. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:03 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and courts constantly do this, they routinely defer to the President, whoever is the president at the time, they routinely defer to the President on national security issues for the basic reasons that it's a power vested in the Executive Branch and lives are at stake so the President, the Executive Branch is the one best suited to kind of make these tough choices and the court doesn't wanna get in the way. But at the same time the court has been happy to wade into issues of legislative prerogative with massive public health implications, so we talked about the court hampering Obama Cares Medicaid expansion and that clearly impacts the health and safety of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of Americans way more than whatever shitty half big travel restrictions came out of the genius brains of Rudy Giuliani and his best friends.</p>
                        <p>16:00 Peter: Right, I'm not super pacifistic on this stuff but you could literally disarm ISIS with AKs and put them on every American beach and let them run wild for a few months and they would not have anywhere near the death toll of the denial of the Medicaid expansion by the Roberts Court.</p>
                        <p>16:16 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:16 Michael: And in the immigration context the National Security difference it's got a special name, they call it the Plenary Powers Doctrine and it's especially shitty as well, it's got a really particularly racist pedigree, Roberts really leans into it in this case and we'll talk about that a little later but it's especially garbage.</p>
                        <p>16:36 Rhiannon: Listen, I consider myself like an expert because they let me talk on this podcast and I'm gonna tell you this Plenary Powers Doctrine it's a bad one.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>16:45 Michael: Okay, that's right.</p>
                        <p>16:47 Peter: Yeah, thank you Rhiannon for weighing in on there.</p>
                        <p>16:50 Rhiannon: Yeah, no problem I got you guys.</p>
                        <p>16:53 Peter: The next thing the majority does is come up with ways to pretend that the executive order has nothing to do with religion and so the first point they make is that the executive order says nothing about religion which is true it doesn't mention religion and this reminds me of if you have ever been to a restaurant at the shore maybe that says like, "No do-rags, baggy pants, sagging pants, like rap music playing from your phone," and you're like, "Oh shit, I'd rather you just say it," [laughter] it's like this is worse that's what this reminds me like yes, congratulations on figuring out a way to come with an executive order that doesn't expressly say no Muslims so you've managed to pass that hurdle Donald Trump and here's like John Roberts to pat you on the back for it.</p>
                        <p>17:39 Michael: Right, John Roberts being like, "My head is spinning. Is this the Muslim ban or is it not," he says in the tweets but then it doesn't say Muslim in the executive order.</p>
                        <p>17:50 Rhiannon: I imagine, I imagine John Roberts like his clerks printed out a copy of the executive order and he's like, he's looking at it upside down [laughter] and his clerks have to be like, "No, Mr. Chief Justice sir, you have to... You need to turn it back around it's upside down actually," and he's like, "Oh, oh my goodness," yeah, he doesn't.</p>
                        <p>18:09 Peter: Yeah, he does make them call him Mr. Chief Justice. [laughter] So it needs to be said that despite the fact that this ban targets a handful of predominantly Muslim countries as well as a couple of non-Muslim countries, there is genuinely no question that this is the mutated modified version of the original proposal for a general ban on Muslims, right?</p>
                        <p>18:31 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>18:31 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:32 Peter: The majority opinion doesn't really question that idea, Rudy Giuliani as Trump's lawyer specifically said on Fox News shortly after the initial executive order that Trump had asked him how to do the Muslim ban legally. Trump was asked in 2016 after he softened the language to be about extreme vetting, why did you do that and he said quote, "people were so upset when I used the word Muslim, oh, you can't use the word Muslim but just remember, remember this, our constitution is great but it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide okay."</p>
                        <p>19:05 President D Trump: I'm looking now at territories, people were so upset when I used the word Muslim, oh, you can't use the word Muslim, remember this, our constitution is great but it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, okay, now we have a religious... Everybody wants to be protected, and that's great and that's a wonderful part of our Constitution. I view it differently. Why are we committing suicide? Why are we doing it? You know what, I live with our Constitution. I love our Constitution. I cherish our Constitution.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:36 Rhiannon: God.</p>
                        <p>19:37 Peter: So look, we dump on the court a lot. We make fun of John Roberts and stuff like that, but sometimes you have to admit, when you're up against a king, you're up against an intellectual titan...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>19:52 Peter: This logic is constitutionally airtight. I have nothing bad to say about it. I almost just cancelled this episode when I saw that quote.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:00 Peter: I was like, "He's got us there."</p>
                        <p>20:01 Michael: Nothing to say.</p>
                        <p>20:02 Peter: Yeah, so I do... I feel bad really for being mean to Trump in this episode after just getting owned by his logic right there.</p>
                        <p>20:10 Rhiannon: Yeah, the brains on this guy.</p>
                        <p>20:11 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:12 Rhiannon: Yeah, and so as the dissent points out that Trump was motivated in the first place and all the way through this process by anti-Muslim animus, that's entirely obvious. So not only is it the genesis of the executive order, the sort of blanket Muslim ban, not only is that readily apparent, but Trump had been an out-and-out bigot concerning Muslims for years. Something pretty powerful. I think that Justice Sonia Sotomayor does in dissent is points this out really explicitly. She includes in full a statement directly from Trump's website. It was a statement that was obviously bigoted. She includes that in full in her dissent and notes that the statement remained on the website months into his presidency. And then she also includes a bunch of quotes directly from Trump that he made in interviews, at rallies while he was on the campaign trail about Muslims. Sotomayor also points out, for example, that Trump online is not only on Twitter, has his own anti-Muslim rhetoric, but is also boosting out-and-out actual literal Nazis. So one example is that he re-tweeted three videos by a neo-fascist named Jayda Fransen out over in the UK, and Justice Sotomayor is saying like, "If these are the people you're boosting to your millions of followers online, how is the direct targeted animus at Muslims, how is that not a major part of the ban?" Right?</p>
                        <p>22:01 Michael: Right. And when you say she's a neo-fascist, she was literally convicted of multiple hate crime offenses. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>22:08 Rhiannon: Right, right. And when she's appearing on her favorite radio channel called Radio Aryan, they're... [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>22:22 Michael: [laughter] Wow.</p>
                        <p>22:22 Rhiannon: They're interviewing her, and right after the interview, the people at the radio station are reading directly from Mein Kampf. This is not... It's so obvious that it's absurd.</p>
                        <p>22:32 Michael: It's not subtle.</p>
                        <p>22:34 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>22:34 Peter: Yeah, but you gotta keep in mind though, that Trump is... He sees a video or something posted online and his brain has three seconds to react before it's on to the next thing.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:47 Peter: And he's not gonna find out that she was on Aryan Radio, and when he does find out an hour later because an aide is like, "Everyone's mad at you."</p>
                        <p>22:55 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>22:55 Peter: He's only got three seconds to process that too. It's three seconds per item.</p>
                        <p>23:00 S26: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>23:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>23:00 Rhiannon: And when the aide rushes up and is like, "Oh, Mr. President, sir, you done fucked up again. People are really mad." He has three chicken nuggets left, and so that's really hard.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:11 Peter: Right, he's eyeballing...</p>
                        <p>23:12 Rhiannon: He can't just like, "Drop everything."</p>
                        <p>23:13 Peter: He's just like side-eyeing his chicken nuggets.</p>
                        <p>23:15 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:17 Peter: His aide is like, "Everyone's furious. You just re-tweeted an open Nazi." And he's just glancing over at the nuggets. He's like...</p>
                        <p>23:24 Michael: What's his go-to McDonald's order? Isn't it like a Big Mac and two Filet-O-Fish or something like that? [laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:31 Peter: Oh, that is vile. I don't really support the Filet-O-Fish on its own, but doing it with a burger is so creepy.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:37 Peter: It's fuckin' awful. Is there a podcast by other people about why every person in the UK is a fascist? What's going on there?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:49 Rhiannon: I would like to learn about that.</p>
                        <p>23:51 Peter: It's never like an American that he re-tweets. It's always like one of these freaks. These Katie Hopkins types. I don't...</p>
                        <p>23:57 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>23:57 Peter: Who are these people? What's going on? I would like to ban them...</p>
                        <p>24:00 Rhiannon: What's going on with them? Yeah.</p>
                        <p>24:01 Peter: Until we can figure it out.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>24:06 Rhiannon: Okay. And Justice Sotomayor says, "Trump's animus against Muslims specifically had been evident for years." It wasn't just with this executive order that we're suddenly questioning like, "Maybe this guy has a problem with Muslims, and he's trying to do a Muslim-specific thing." Back in 2011, Trump was publicly questioning then President Barack Obama's religious beliefs and his place of birth, right?</p>
                        <p>24:36 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:37 Rhiannon: Donald Trump made a...</p>
                        <p>24:37 Peter: And it says something, by the way, I'm sorry to cut you off, but it says something that there's so much animus in this country towards Muslims that Barack Obama had to pretend that he wasn't one.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>24:49 Michael: Oh, man. So proud to be a part of this podcast.</p>
                        <p>24:53 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so he was questioning, of course, Barack Obama's birth certificate, saying in a radio interview, "I have no idea if this is bad for him or not, perhaps it could be where it says religion." He's talking about on the birth certificate, "Where it says religion, it might have Muslim. And if you're a Muslim... "</p>
                        <p>25:15 Peter: Yeah, the classic part of the birth certificate.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:19 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>25:20 Peter: Where it says best friend, Osama Bin Laden.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:25 Rhiannon: You know, throughout 2015, when Donald Trump is on the campaign trail, the anti-Muslim rhetoric is crazy obvious and explicit. He says in a campaign town hall in New Hampshire... Oh my god. Do you guys remember this? A man in the audience shouts out, "We have a problem in this country, it's called Muslims, and we know our current president is one." And Trump responds, "We're gonna be looking at a lot of different things to address this problem. You know a lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. We're gonna be looking at that, and plenty of other things." Later in 2015, he pledges again at a campaign rally to kick out all Syrian refugees, most of whom are Muslim because they might be banding together as a secret army. He says quote...</p>
                        <p>26:18 Peter: That's true. They might be, you have to admit they might be.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:21 Michael: You can't rule it out.</p>
                        <p>26:24 Rhiannon: Right, he says, quote "They could be Isis, I don't know. This could be one of the great tactical ploys of all time. A 200,000 man army, maybe? This could make...</p>
                        <p>26:33 Peter: It's the ultimate Trojan horse. First, you have a war in your country that completely destroys it, and then you all travel to one country that you subsequently attack from the inside. That's extremely elaborate Trojan horse.</p>
                        <p>26:46 Rhiannon: Peter it sounds like you and Trump are on the same wavelength because the punchline to that was, quote Trump says, "This could make the Trojan horse look like Peanuts."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>27:00 Michael: Somehow I don't think I ever heard that.</p>
                        <p>27:02 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:03 Michael: That's incredible.</p>
                        <p>27:04 Rhiannon: Uh-huh, and so yeah. This stuff is obvious, it's well documented. He was saying it in interviews, he was saying it in rallies. He says, "We're going to ban Muslims from coming in the country" multiple times.</p>
                        <p>27:19 Peter: Yeah. I mean the real underlying theme in the majority opinion is that they have this like cartoonish level of credulousness towards the administration's claims, right? The Trump Administration is saying that this policy, is not for legal purposes the manifestation of Trump's continuous references to a Muslim ban, but is in fact, a policy necessary for national security reasons. And it's one of the most transparently dishonest positions you could take. Taking it should be the death knell of your argument here but the court treats it as legitimate for what I think is really just no credible reason. And it's important to recognize that this provides a framework moving forward for the Executive Branch to enact discriminatory policy.</p>
                        <p>28:03 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>28:03 Peter: Even if there's clear evidence that the real, kind of driver of a policy, is racial or religious animus as long as it's facially neutral, and there's some ostensible national security justification, you're good to go. Roberts, in his opinion, mentions that this only impacts a small percentage of the Muslim population worldwide. But, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter...</p>
                        <p>28:26 Michael: Yeah, no.</p>
                        <p>28:26 Peter: If you just impacted one guy, if the reason is that he's Muslim, that's a violation of the Establishment Clause. You can't be like, "Well look, this is just Abdul, that's my boy Abdul over there. Sorry Abdul, you're fucked."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:41 Peter: You can't come here. But because it's just him, that's not a constitutional violation." that doesn't fucking work. If the reason is the religion, then it's unconstitutional. Period.</p>
                        <p>28:51 Rhiannon: Right and the opinion just like totally glosses over that, does not engage with that argument at all. The very first sentence of the syllabus, I don't know if you guys saw this, the syllabus is a section that kind of summarizes the court's holding at the beginning of published opinions by the Supreme Court. First sentence it says, "In September 2017, the President issued Proclamation number 9645 seeking to improve vetting procedures for foreign nationals traveling to the United States by identifying blah blah blah blah blah."</p>
                        <p>29:22 Michael: Jesus Christ. Just assuming the conclusion right up.</p>
                        <p>29:24 Rhiannon: Exactly. They've assumed the conclusion. They've assumed the administration and President Trump's argument for why it's okay. And they're already assuming it in the background facts setting up the case, that we're just trying to improve the immigration vetting procedures, that's it.</p>
                        <p>29:40 Michael: And look, as extreme and reactionary as this decision is, it's totally consistent with 130 years of Supreme Court precedent.</p>
                        <p>29:51 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>29:52 Michael: There's definitely some nerd out there who has had steam pouring out of his ears and his face red because we mentioned the Preliminary Powers Doctrine, and then just cruised past it. 'Cause that's basically been the green light for the government to be racist and fascist in the immigration context. The first case, 1889, was called Chae Chan Ping v. United States, and it was about an immigration law literally called "The Chinese Exclusion Act."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>30:23 Peter: Which by the way, I should say last episode we mentioned that if there's ever a plaintiff that's just like business buzzwords, that's an awful sign. In the late 1800's, if there's a Chinese plaintiff it's gonna be an awful decision. Like you're about to be shocked.</p>
                        <p>30:39 Michael: Yes, absolutely. And so, dear listener, I will leave it as an exercise for you as to whether or not this law sounds racist in what it might be [laughter] hoping to achieve. [laughter] But in a shocker, the Supreme Court unanimously found that The Chinese Exclusion Act was constitutional, and they did so on, in part, national security grounds and this was sort of the genesis of this whole idea. And it says "To preserve it's independence and give security against foreign aggression encroachment, it's the highest duty of every nation. Entertain these ends nearly all other considerations are to be subordinated." Which is saying, "Fucking throw the Bill of Rights out the window, we're really scared of Chinese people coming and, you know, building the railroad."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>31:33 Michael: And so all the justices... Or not all the justices, but a majority of the justices in this case, were also on the court a few years later when it handed down Plessy v. Ferguson, which is one of the most hated, maligned decisions in Supreme Court history, where they said, separate but equal segregation is constitutional, but this case is still good law. [chuckle] And it has been cited many times well into the 1970s, it's still fucking the law of the land, and it's like the sister decision, it's the immigration sister to Plessy. And a more recent example of the court articulating this sort of garbage was human shit stained and known segregationist Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 2003 saying, "This court firmly and repeatedly endorsed the proposition that Congress may make rules as to aliens that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens."</p>
                        <p>32:25 Rhiannon: Cute.</p>
                        <p>32:27 Michael: Yeah, they don't need to invoke this doctrine when the government's doing pretty normal okay things, it's when they're doing heinous shit is when...</p>
                        <p>32:36 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>32:37 Michael: [laughter] This is like one of the key cases in this, like is literally deporting legal residents because they were members of the Communist Party in the peak of McCarthyism, and that case was cited by the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii.</p>
                        <p>32:54 Rhiannon: Perfect.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:54 Michael: But it's like... And so to those nerds who are upset that we are like or sort of like, "Who cares about plenary powers?" I just wanna say, "Look, if you want to embrace Plessy v. Ferguson's sister case, fucking, you do you. You go off."</p>
                        <p>33:11 Rhiannon: Right. Go off, I guess.</p>
                        <p>33:13 Michael: Yeah. You wanna embrace the court embracing McCarthyism, that's fucking great. Stand next to the most maligned racists and fascists in Supreme Court history. That's what this doctrine's about, that's what this case is about.</p>
                        <p>33:31 Peter: Right, yeah. And if you are some nerd complaining about our podcast, we're looking into the law and we're gonna get you deported. [laughter] We're gonna figure it out. We might not sound like we're actually good at the practice of law, but I have been dedicating dozens of hours to this, we're gonna get all of you sent out of this country to a really bad one, like... France, just off the top of my head. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>33:52 Rhiannon: Michael, I'm really glad that you're nerdy in this way because I think it's so important, like these... I don't know, I feel like a broken record. I might say this every fucking episode, but the cases...</p>
                        <p>34:07 Michael: That's good.</p>
                        <p>34:07 Rhiannon: They don't come out of a vacuum, right? Like the beginning of immigration law in the United States, the reason why we have immigration enforcement mechanisms, all of that comes from a racist history of exclusion of people of color from the United States.</p>
                        <p>34:23 Michael: Right. Yeah, and look, their hands aren't bound here, and I mean that. There have been other times where the court has been like, "Yeah, of course, the Constitution applies in immigration context." [chuckle] Indefinite detention of deportable aliens or... And the availability of habeas corpus review... There are cases, recent cases, even, where the court has been like shrugged its shoulders at the plenary powers doctrine or ignored it entirely. Justice Sotomayor's dissent is just basically a roadmap of how one of those cases, those decisions could look. This turned out the way it did, because they wanted it to turn out this way.</p>
                        <p>35:00 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>35:02 Peter: So I think we should talk about conservative hypocrisy about the freedom of religion.</p>
                        <p>35:11 Rhiannon: Yes, let's.</p>
                        <p>35:11 Michael: Speaking of how they wanted this to turn out.</p>
                        <p>35:15 Peter: There will almost certainly never come a day when a Muslim President spends an entire presidential campaign talking about the evils of Christianity and immediately bans travel from several Christian countries, but if it does happen, I truly hope John Roberts is alive to see it. [laughter] It would fill my heart with warmth and then whenever, I assume it would be some time in the distant future, but I would like to just peacefully pass away as soon as I witness it. So on the general question of whether the conservatives on the court treat the establishment clause differently depending on the religion in question, we don't need to look further than Masterpiece Cakeshop v. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission. A case...</p>
                        <p>35:58 Rhiannon: A banger. A true banger.</p>
                        <p>36:03 Michael: A true banger. And a case decided the same month as Trump v. Hawaii.</p>
                        <p>36:06 Rhiannon: Perfect.</p>
                        <p>36:06 Michael: That's unreal.</p>
                        <p>36:09 Peter: Masterpiece Cakeshop is the gay wedding cake case. The basic issue is whether a cake shop had the right to deny a gay couple service on the basis that barring them from doing so, interfered with their first amendment rights to freedom of religion and to freedom of speech. And the court punted on that issue, and their reason was that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission when evaluating the matter displayed animosity towards the bakers' religious beliefs and the court ordered that the case be...</p>
                        <p>36:38 Michael: That sounds familiar.</p>
                        <p>36:40 Peter: Reconsidered without the anti-Christian bias.</p>
                        <p>36:42 Rhiannon: That's interesting. That the animus towards a religion, it really mattered there. It sounds like it matters.</p>
                        <p>36:49 Peter: It did.</p>
                        <p>36:49 Michael: Even when it might otherwise be a facially okay policy...</p>
                        <p>36:51 Peter: Facially neutral decision. Interesting.</p>
                        <p>36:55 Michael: The motivating factor might change the way the courts... That's crazy. I would never have expected that.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:01 Peter: So, for reference, the supposed anti-Christian bias displayed by the commission was when a member made comparisons between the baker's defense and religious defenses of slavery and the Holocaust, which for the record, I think is a reasonable point, just as like a point of reference. It's not that discrimination against gays in public accommodations is as severe as slavery or the Holocaust, it's that nearly every single instance of discrimination or mistreatment of oppressed groups across the western world in general, has been done with some ostensible religious justification, and if you weren't connecting those dots, you're either an idiot or you're one of the ones doing the oppressing.</p>
                        <p>37:43 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>37:44 Peter: And I'm not super interested in figuring out which one like Neil Gorsuch is because it doesn't fucking matter.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>37:52 Peter: [chuckle] So in that case, the court was able to read the minds of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and say they were driven by anti-Christian bias from a few stray comments, but here they hide behind this clearly manufactured national security argument. They don't seriously interrogate the motives of the government at all, despite the fact that the statements made by Trump were much more explicit than anything you heard out of anyone in the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, who were just making off-hand comparisons, whereas Trump is literally saying, "We need to keep Muslims out of the country." And then passing a law that looks a bunch like that.</p>
                        <p>38:29 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:29 Michael: Yes. And trying multiple times, there is no denying that they were trying to fit the racist round peg into the race neutral square hole, right? It's like...</p>
                        <p>38:39 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:40 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>38:41 Peter: What if we threw in Venezuelans, does that make it less offensive?</p>
                        <p>38:43 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>38:43 Michael: [laughter] Yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>38:45 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>38:45 Peter: By the way, the part, we didn't really get into the details, but the restrictions on Venezuelans and Koreans are nominal as Sotomayor points out, people from North Korea can't readily come here anyway, so it's pretty much just symbolic, and the restriction of the Venezuelans was limited to a few diplomats, like just literally a handful of people.</p>
                        <p>39:04 Michael: [chuckle] Yes.</p>
                        <p>39:05 Peter: So it's pure optics.</p>
                        <p>39:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's right. And the opinion spends a good deal of time sort of talking about how there's exceptions, there's certain waivers and there's exceptions to this ban, so if you are from some of these countries and you are trying to get to the United States, it's not totally, it's not 100% of people that are gonna be banned, there are different mechanisms for letting people in, if you're good enough or whatever, and it's an obsession with making a clearly bad thing just, if we can just get it past the end line of legal, if we can just say, "Look, this is law stuff, look, there are mechanisms for exceptions, there are... This is an executive order, this is the plenary powers," right? Like if we can give it this label and sheen of a legitimate exercise of institutional power, then we're good. I'm always left with, but what did the legal label give us, right? So I don't know if it's corny to say or whatever, but slavery was legal, the Holocaust was legal, not even to get into a slippery slope thing, like if we accept this, then 10 years from now, Muslims will be in camps in the United States, I'm not even saying that, I'm saying like, what does it get us as a society, as a country to make this legal? This is bad enough, it's hateful and it's disgusting, and thousands of people the world over were affected by this.</p>
                        <p>40:34 Michael: And both the iterative process of the several travel bans like working their way through the courts, and ultimately the court's decision, I think kind of functions in a similar way that we described the stop and frisk decision functioning where it's basically like, look, if you wanna be fucking racist, this is just how you have to describe it after the fact, to slip in underneath the court's radar...</p>
                        <p>41:02 Rhiannon: Yes, that's such a good point of view.</p>
                        <p>41:04 Michael: Or get us to turn off the security camera or whatever the fucking analogy is that works. That's what it is. It's not about actually preventing unconstitutional conduct, it's about teaching people how to describe their unconstitutional conduct in a way that sounds constitutional enough to pass muster.</p>
                        <p>41:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's about rubber-stamping things, facially, obviously hateful unconstitutional things as legal.</p>
                        <p>41:32 Peter: Right. And then wagging your fucking finger like this is one of those cases where I think laymen hear about it and are like, "Well, that seems like pretty obviously unconstitutional, right?" And some fucking Federalist Society 3L is like, "Actually, the ban was more limited" and like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's the sort of thing where you can easily lose the plot, and if you just take a step back...</p>
                        <p>41:55 Rhiannon: Yes yes.</p>
                        <p>41:56 Peter: You will see the motivations for what they are, they are readily apparent, as dumb as we think the five conservatives on the court are, I guarantee you they're fucking smart enough to know that this was designed to harm Muslims.</p>
                        <p>42:08 Rhiannon: Absolutely, yup.</p>
                        <p>42:10 Peter: Everyone can fucking see it, and you don't need to pretend that there's some technical reason why we need to look past that.</p>
                        <p>42:17 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>42:18 Peter: One of the big takeaways here to me is that when it comes to state sanctioned discrimination, the conservatives on the court have been very willing to sit idly by as long as the victims are groups that they feel are other, and here, because in the bottom of their hearts, they probably really do believe that Muslims are a security threat, and that there's some link between being Muslim and potential danger to national security, and for over a century before that in countless immigration cases where the humanity of people seeking safety and hope is treated like an afterthought next to some abstruse sense of nationalistic pride. And you can keep that shit in mind the next time they rule that some weirdo insular freak who has spent his entire life on the side of institutional power has the First Amendment right to spit at the feet of a gay person in his donut shop or whatever the fuck.</p>
                        <p>43:12 Michael: Right, and some federal society douchebag would also tell me that what I'm about to say doesn't actually link up to this case or whatever, but this is also something to remember, like next week when ICE the modern fucking Gestapo commit yet another atrocity and there's no judicial review of any of it, it's the same shit, it's the same legal culture, we're engaging in ethnic cleansing at the border, and it's the same xenophobic racist bullshit that allows it.</p>
                        <p>43:47 Peter: Right. If you're in the federalist society, you see human suffering, and the first thing you do is look for a fucking technicality. And it's worth noting that every time someone responds to that sort of allegation with like, "Well, they're undocumented" or whatever, the real question is, who provides the fucking documents, 'cause when you say, "Well, you don't have your papers" or whatever it might be, and you're the body that issues the papers and you're using that as the justification to round them up, kick them out, or occasionally, fucking snipe them from across the border, and whatever the latest atrocity of vice is, you couldn't possibly keep up, then it doesn't fucking matter. There's no substantive difference.</p>
                        <p>44:30 Rhiannon: Yeah, I mean, it also makes me think about the far-reaching consequences many years down the line. So in my world, in the criminal legal world, we are already talking about kids who are kept in cages and what that means for them when they turn 18 and 20 years old and what that means for our criminal legal system, right? And how the law is going to come down hard on them again, for precisely the trauma that was enacted upon them by the government here.</p>
                        <p>45:00 Michael: And if you think this is limited to "Illegal aliens," you are fucking kidding yourself.</p>
                        <p>45:08 Peter: Yeah, that's a good point.</p>
                        <p>45:10 Michael: First of all, there are literally confirmed cases that you can read in any newspaper of citizens being detained for weeks, months because they have Hispanic last names, not to mention that it is known that ICE is going through actual legal residents or naturalized citizens' histories looking for any discrepancy they can use to claw back their legal status and you're kidding yourself. I think I've said you're kidding yourself and keeping your head in the sand a lot, but if you think the courts are gonna give you any respite here, fuck if the Muslim ban, the thing that's literally known as the Muslim ban is okay, then forget about it. And again, this is immigration and its national security, and it's the same shit, and you'll have the same results if you can even get standing to have your case heard.</p>
                        <p>46:09 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>46:19 Peter: Alright, next week is Castle Rock The Gonzales, a case with one of the most horrific set of facts you will ever hear in your fucking life and certainly the most disturbing set of facts we've covered so far.</p>
                        <p>46:35 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>

                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We will continue argument this morning in case number 11-393, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:10 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone, it's Leon Neyfakh, co-creator of Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about the Supreme Court case that upheld ObamaCare.</p>
                        <p>00:21 [Archival]: The stakes only grow larger with months before an election. Will the justices be criticized for letting politics creep into the courtroom?</p>
                        <p>00:30 Leon Neyfakh: The case is from 2012, with a majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts. As the hosts are about to explain, it was an opinion that people who support affordable healthcare, or any other progressive legislation, should regard with more than a little suspicion.</p>
                        <p>00:46 [Archival]: You ask really for limiting principles so we don't get into a matter that I think has nothing to do with this case: Broccoli, okay?</p>
                        <p>00:56 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>01:07 Peter: Welcome to 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have slowly poisoned American life, like toxic runoff into a mountain stream. I am Peter, Twitter's @The_Law_Boy, and I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:20 Michael: Hey everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:22 Peter: And from Austin, Texas, Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:26 Rhiannon: Hi fam.</p>
                        <p>01:26 Peter: And today, we are doing NFIB v. Sebelius, aka the ObamaCare decision, and this case was touted by many liberals at the time as a win because it technically upheld ObamaCare. At the same time though, a lot of academics sounded the alarm because not only did the court strike down an important part of the law, but it laid the groundwork for jurisprudence that is set to undermine healthcare, civil rights and environmental legislation for decades. And to be specific, this case was a challenge to two parts of the ObamaCare law: The Individual Mandate, which required Americans to buy health insurance or otherwise pay a penalty, and the law's expansion of the Medicaid program, to cover more of the population. The argument was for, that for various reasons, these parts of the law exceeded Congress's authority under the Constitution, and the court held that the Individual Mandate could be upheld under Congress's taxing power, but not its Commerce Clause power, and that the expansion of Medicaid as written, was a violation of Congress's Spending Clause power.</p>
                        <p>02:33 Peter: This case is a shining example, I think, of the lengths that conservatives will go to limit federal power when it's politically convenient to them, and the conservatives here do exactly the sort of shit that they claim liberal justices do, right? They pull from thin air, or perhaps somewhere else [laughter] restraints on the federal government's commerce and spending powers, they rely on arbitrary distinctions that have no basis in the Constitution or anywhere else, and they do it in order to hamper ObamaCare and lay the groundwork to disrupt the next generation of social welfare legislation.</p>
                        <p>03:08 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>03:08 Peter: And we return here to this podcast's natural enemy, Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
                        <p>03:17 Rhiannon: Drag him!</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>03:18 Peter: We talked in Shelby County about the Roberts' two-step, and that is where he sets up dangerous conservative jurisprudence, he tees it up in an earlier case, a much more harmless-looking case, and then he knocks it out of the fucking park later.</p>
                        <p>03:34 Michael: Yep.</p>
                        <p>03:35 Peter: And this is an example of the first step in the Roberts' two-step: A decision that's designed to feel impartial while serving as a vessel for his reactionary politics. And one thing I wanna note about this is, he's so aware of his audience that you can read in the first few paragraphs of this, it's like an introductory civics lesson that he goes on.</p>
                        <p>03:55 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>03:56 Peter: And it's clearly aimed at journalists and people that are reading it, baby's first Supreme Court decision, and he's very interested in presenting to the public the appearance of the Court as a noble and impartial body. But like we talked about in Shelby County, that image is a veneer, it's not substantive, and what would actually improve [chuckle] the public's trust in the court would be like, if maybe sometimes he meaningfully and more consistently sided with the liberals, right?</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>04:26 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>04:26 Peter: But he will never do that, never do that, because his vision of a non-partisan court is just a shadow on the wall.</p>
                        <p>04:35 Michael: Right. I saw this, I think it was law professor Eric Segall on Twitter who said this, Roberts has sided with the liberals in a 5-4 decision three times in 15 years, which is like... Gorsuch, I think, has beat that already in the last two years.</p>
                        <p>04:52 Peter: Yeah, there's a real irony, which is that, in a lot of ways, Roberts is one of the most rigidly conservative justices. Someone like Gorsuch has their little niches where they'll branch out, but Roberts just doesn't. He's just a standard-bearer hardliner.</p>
                        <p>05:05 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's actually a kind of tricky part about reading Roberts. In NFIB, I just remember that in law school, as a law student, I struggled to understand the arguments here and the holding, it's really complicated. The legislation that's being challenged is complicated, and then the way the opinion is written is complicated, but I think that when you come to the case with the understanding that Roberts is primarily concerned with these optics, it makes the case make more sense.</p>
                        <p>05:36 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:37 Rhiannon: So I'm sure you guys remember this too, watching the news the day this decision came down, and they have [chuckle] the reporters, they're just waiting at the Supreme Court for these decisions to be issued, and they have their interns who are all wearing their little suits, but they're also wearing tennis shoes. [chuckle] They have them waiting for the opinion, which was printed out and handed to them, and then the interns sprint down and bring it to the people who are waiting and they try to read the opinion really quickly to then turn it over on the air.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>06:09 Peter: Incredibly embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>06:11 Rhiannon: And this decision, though, is so confusing that on the morning of, CNN and Fox News both actually call it wrong.</p>
                        <p>06:19 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>06:20 Rhiannon: They say that the Individual Mandate has been struck down when it hadn't been.</p>
                        <p>06:27 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>06:27 Rhiannon: And so, what we get from Roberts waffling on these optics, and therefore on the substance of the law, what you get is a case that's illogical and it's internally inconsistent.</p>
                        <p>06:37 Michael: Yeah, we'll get to it, but one of the reasons it's confusing is 'cause he's just [chuckle] going out of his way to be a reactionary.</p>
                        <p>06:44 Peter: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>06:46 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>06:47 Peter: So some of the background to this is that, this is Obama's first big legislative project, what ends up being his only big legislative project, really. And it came to be a lightning rod for conservatives who thought that it really was emblematic of government overreach and everything they hated about Obama.</p>
                        <p>07:04 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:08 Peter: And the result is that the Tea Party... Whenever Republicans are out of power, they turn into temporary libertarians, right?</p>
                        <p>07:15 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>07:15 Peter: So they were marching on DC, dressed up like Continental Army soldiers.</p>
                        <p>07:19 Michael: Tri-corner hats.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>07:22 Peter: Muskets and snare drums and shit, just looking like total fucking idiots, [chuckle] holding up signs with a bald eagle crying. [chuckle] Worth noting that all of those people are now 100% outright fascist, who want all of their political opponents in jail and asylum seekers in concentration camps, but this was their reaction to being told to buy insurance.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:47 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:49 Peter: That's like the political backdrop to this.</p>
                        <p>07:52 Michael: Do you remember that, at first, 'cause they're all old and they don't know slang, that they called themselves Tea-Baggers?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:58 Rhiannon: Oh yeah!</p>
                        <p>08:00 Peter: Oh yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:00 Rhiannon: Oh my God! [laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:00 Michael: It was for a few weeks there, that they were like "Tea-Baggers," before someone was like, [laughter] "No, you gotta come up with something better than that."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:09 Peter: Unbelievable.</p>
                        <p>08:10 Rhiannon: Somebody's son was like, "Umm, Dad... " Yeah.</p>
                        <p>08:14 Peter: Yeah. Alright. Rhi, tell me about the National Federation of Independent Businesses.</p>
                        <p>08:21 Michael: The aggrieved plaintiff.</p>
                        <p>08:23 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:23 Rhiannon: Yeah. So this case is brought by multiple organizations and states who are suing the federal government, but the named plaintiff is NFIB, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and this is another non-profit organization that calls itself a non-partisan organization that defends the rights of small business owners to own and operate their businesses without undue government interference. This non-partisan organization [chuckle] has a political action committee called...</p>
                        <p>08:55 Michael: No way.</p>
                        <p>08:56 Rhiannon: The Save America's Free Enterprise Trust, and one day on this podcast, you guys are gonna let me go off about the non-profit industrial complex, but I guess...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:09 Rhiannon: I've been told that that's not today. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:12 Peter: I wanna say, you know a case is about some weird conservative bullshit when the plaintiff is one of these organizations whose name is just an amalgamation of business buzzwords.</p>
                        <p>09:22 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:24 Peter: If you see a case called the American Society for Capital Allocation v. Pennsylvania, someone is about to lose their civil rights.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:30 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>09:31 Rhiannon: Yeah, right. Absolutely, it has to be a patriotic word and an institution word, yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:37 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>09:39 Rhiannon: So if you're wondering who NFIB, these kind of small business wackos, are politically, in 2010, a couple years before this decision drops, 25 members of NFIB were elected to Congress, all 25 of them are Republicans.</p>
                        <p>09:54 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>09:55 Rhiannon: And a bunch of them...</p>
                        <p>09:55 Peter: That is a crazy coincidence.</p>
                        <p>09:57 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>09:58 Rhiannon: Yeah. A bunch of them, like Rand Paul and Paul Gosar were endorsed by the Tea Party movement, so... Oh, another fun fact is that the Crossroads GPS Pack, which is headed by our favorite wretched little goblin freak, Karl Rove, they give NFIB $3.7 Million to help fund this fight in the courts, so Republican money is all over this case, and I think it's important to note that not all small business advocates and consumer advocate groups are against ObamaCare at the time. There are a lot of organizations who are saying, this would be good for small business owners, this would be good for the economy. I think it's important to highlight that the money and organizations who are bringing cases to the Supreme Court, they're not just your little harmed individual party John Smith seeking their day in court. These cases come to the Supreme Court from entrenched ideological interests and big money backing.</p>
                        <p>10:57 Michael: This whole conservative ecological legal system, that includes the organization that feeds the judges that end up hearing these cases, they're coming out of the same movement.</p>
                        <p>11:09 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:10 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>11:12 Peter: So let's talk about the law, and it's important to note, as we get into this, a very basic aspect of our constitutional system, which is that the federal government does not have any power that is not granted to it under the Constitution. So if Congress wants to do something, it has to fit whatever that is under one of the powers specifically granted to it, the "enumerated powers," and there are three powers most relevant to this case: The power to tax, the power to spend and power to regulate interstate commerce. And we wanna note, going into this, there are several parts of this decision that we're gonna ignore, there's a lot going on here, and if someone replies to us on Twitter, "Why didn't you cover the Anti-Injunction Act and do half an hour [chuckle] on the Necessary and Proper Clause?" I'm gonna come to your home and I'm gonna kill you.</p>
                        <p>12:03 Rhiannon: Whoa! [laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:03 Michael: That's a parody, not a real threat.</p>
                        <p>12:06 Peter: Okay, let me try that again.</p>
                        <p>12:08 Rhiannon: And I'll defend him in court.</p>
                        <p>12:10 Peter: I'm gonna come to your home and scream at you for several hours.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:14 Michael: Figuratively kill you.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:19 Peter: I'm just gonna do that from the top. [laughter] If you complain to us, that we did not cover the Anti-Injunction Act in this episode, you're not a friend of mine, [laughter] I'm never gonna like you, and that shit is boring, and that's why we left it out of here. It's boring and unimportant.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:43 Peter: Alright.</p>
                        <p>12:46 Michael: Alright.</p>
                        <p>12:46 Peter: So, the Individual Mandate is the first thing we're gonna talk about here. And again, this requires individuals to have health insurance or else pay a penalty. And this is designed to prevent the economic problems that are created by people being uninsured, right?</p>
                        <p>13:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>13:01 Peter: This is actually upheld by the court because John Roberts joins the liberals in saying it's part of Congress's taxing power. You know, that someone buy insurance, and it only has one consequence, if they don't buy it. They pay a tax penalty, right?</p>
                        <p>13:15 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>13:15 Peter: As a result, the mandate should and does survive as part of Congress's taxing power.</p>
                        <p>13:23 Michael: Right. And so, the intricacies of the Court's taxing jurisprudence is not really what this podcast is about. It's worth taking a minute to appreciate how fucking rotted your brain has to be by Fox News or syphilis or some [laughter] combination thereof, to disagree with Roberts' analysis on this taxing question and four Supreme Court justices did just that. It's fucking insane, 'cause Roberts cites precedent that's undisputed, that whether something is a tax is basically a functional analysis. It doesn't really matter whether Congress calls it a tax or not, and he has examples where they call something a tax and the Court was like, "That's not a tax," and vice versa.</p>
                        <p>14:09 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>14:09 Michael: And he says, "Look, here are five reasons why we think this is a tax. One, individuals pay the mandate penalty when they file their taxes. Two, the mandate does not apply to individuals whose income puts them below the federal income tax filing threshold. Three, the amount owed is determined by factors used to determine tax liability, like joint filing status or number of dependents. Four, the requirement is listed in the IRS code and enforced by the IRS. And five, it has the most essential feature of a tax, in that it raises revenue for the federal government."</p>
                        <p>14:47 Peter: Right. Just...</p>
                        <p>14:48 Rhiannon: Did you guys take Tax Law?</p>
                        <p>14:49 Peter: Hell no.</p>
                        <p>14:49 Michael: No. Fuck, no.</p>
                        <p>14:51 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>14:51 Peter: Fuck, no.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:53 Peter: Absolutely fucking not.</p>
                        <p>14:56 Rhiannon: Those fucking nerds.</p>
                        <p>14:58 Michael: You have a law in the tax code enforced by the IRS to raise money for the government. The idea that this isn't a tax, it's ludicrous.</p>
                        <p>15:05 Peter: Yeah. So, the Individual Mandate gets upheld as a tax, but...</p>
                        <p>15:10 Michael: Simple enough.</p>
                        <p>15:11 Peter: In the process, Roberts specifically states that the Individual Mandate is not a proper exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause, and the Commerce Clause says that Congress can regulate commerce, "among the several states," it's generally referred to as the Interstate Commerce Clause or the Interstate Commerce Provision and this makes sense. If more than one state has an interest in an issue, then state laws probably aren't adequate to address it, right? You need federal intervention. And moreover, the historical context of the Constitution makes very clear that the framers intended this to be a very broad power designed to empower Congress to be able to address concerns and issues that are of national import, right? It's long been a thorn in the side of conservatives.</p>
                        <p>15:56 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>15:57 Peter: Because they want to limit federal power, and unfortunately for them, this gives the federal government a lot of power.</p>
                        <p>16:04 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:04 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>16:05 Peter: That's all there is to it, really.</p>
                        <p>16:05 Michael: We have a massive national economy.</p>
                        <p>16:06 Peter: Yeah and there's a very fun irony which is that, the conservatives generally subscribe to originalism, the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted based on the Founders' intent. But this is an area, where the Founders probably didn't foresee what commerce would look like in the modern age. Like in 1790, [chuckle] most interstate commerce was just like, one guy bringing a single tomato [chuckle] from New Jersey to Pennsylvania, once a week. [chuckle] And now, state lines, they barely exist, people are constantly traveling across them, goods are constantly traveling across them, and so the federal government has a huge amount of power under this clause, and it is endlessly frustrating to conservatives.</p>
                        <p>16:48 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>16:49 Peter: And so, they have spent basically a 100 years now, trying to put as many arbitrary limitations on this clause, as they can possibly throw together.</p>
                        <p>16:57 Michael: Massive long-running conservative project.</p>
                        <p>17:00 Peter: Yeah, and so what Roberts says is that the Commerce Clause regulates economic activity between the states, but it doesn't regulate economic inactivity.</p>
                        <p>17:09 Michael: Ho ho.</p>
                        <p>17:10 Rhiannon: Woah.</p>
                        <p>17:10 Peter: So Congress can't use it to require people who aren't purchasing insurance to buy it and it should be noted that this is an entirely made up distinction. It has no basis in the text of the Constitution, it has no basis in the Court's precedent, it has no basis in the historical context of the Constitution, flat out made-up, period. Roberts says that, allowing Congress to regulate what people cannot do, as opposed to just what they can do, risks giving Congress too much power. [laughter] So, there's a huge amount wrong with this. First of all is a pedantic distinction, right?</p>
                        <p>17:48 Michael: It is.</p>
                        <p>17:49 Peter: He says that The Commerce Clause, "regulates commerce and therefore does not allow Congress to force people to create commerce." [chuckle] It's a very weird semantic point that clings to a shoddy definition of both the words, "regulate" and "commerce," which if you're paying attention, are the only two words in the mix here.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:14 Peter: The term regulate, as I would understand it, does not exclude mandating affirmative activity or affirmative behavior, right?</p>
                        <p>18:20 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:20 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>18:21 Peter: Textualists often go to dictionary definitions at times like these.</p>
                        <p>18:25 Michael: Yes, they... They love the Oxford Old English.</p>
                        <p>18:28 Peter: Roberts didn't do it here. [laughter] And there's a pretty good reason why, I think.</p>
                        <p>18:33 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:35 Peter: 'Cause I hit up dictionary.com for this one, [laughter] and the definition they gave me was, for "regulate," to control or supervise, by means of rules and regulations. Does that definition clearly exclude the mandatory purchase of insurance to you?</p>
                        <p>18:51 Michael: Seems like a rule.</p>
                        <p>18:52 Peter: Seems like it might be a rule.</p>
                        <p>18:52 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>18:53 Peter: Regulations on industries, for example, frequently impose affirmative obligations on those industries, right? And I've never heard anyone suggest that the term regulations was inaccurate or not adequate or something.</p>
                        <p>19:05 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's exactly right. And he also doesn't seem to understand either, what the word, "commerce" actually is. [chuckle] So, both words in the pivotal phrase here and the dissent actually points this out, that...</p>
                        <p>19:20 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:20 Rhiannon: The distinction between regulating and creating commerce or the distinction between commercial activity and commercial inactivity, that doesn't matter anyway. The reality is that everyone is a participant in the healthcare market and there's just no way around that.</p>
                        <p>19:36 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:36 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>19:38 Rhiannon: The dissent also uses some hard numbers showing that even 90% of uninsured people will consume healthcare services within a five-year span. Okay, completely disengaging from the healthcare system is technically, probably possible, if you're like a psycho, cuckoo, off-the-grid person [chuckle] or whatever. But even those who don't consume health care services are almost all creating some sort of burden on the health care system.</p>
                        <p>20:06 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:06 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:06 Peter: You can't create your laws around fucking recluses who...</p>
                        <p>20:09 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:09 Peter: Do not use any sort of health care and by the way, no one who's doing that is paying taxes.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:15 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:16 Rhiannon: Right. [laughter] Exactly. So Roberts, he says in his opinion, "The Government repeats the phrase "active in the market for health care," throughout its brief, but that concept has no constitutional significance."</p>
                        <p>20:30 Michael: I don't know about that.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>20:31 Rhiannon: Okay. So, Chief Justice John Roberts, you suck at persuasive writing because that's just super stupid. How can the concept of activity in the market for healthcare, not be of constitutional significance, when you just said that the entire basis for your decision is that you can regulate activity but not inactivity.</p>
                        <p>20:53 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Rhiannon: And so, the whole decision concerning the Commerce Clause is predicated on this distinction exactly, being of constitutional significance. He says another quote, "An individual who bought a car two years ago and may buy another in the future is not "active in the car market" in any pertinent sense.</p>
                        <p>21:10 Peter: Ehh.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>21:12 Rhiannon: You're wrong. No, that's not correct, John. Mr. Chief Justice, I'm super sorry. [chuckle] If someone buys a product and is using it, they're active in that market, period.</p>
                        <p>21:23 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:23 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:25 Peter: Right. Like how simple is that?</p>
                        <p>21:26 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>21:26 Peter: Roberts seems to think that you're only participating in a market if you're engaged in a transaction at that very moment, which is just obvious horse shit.</p>
                        <p>21:35 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>21:36 Peter: And I'm not shopping for clothes right now. Am I not a participant in the clothing market? Right?</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>21:41 Rhiannon: Right. Exactly.</p>
                        <p>21:42 Peter: Despite the fact that I bought them my entire adult life, wear them every single day and I'm guaranteed to buy more. Does it make any sense to describe me as not being a participant in that market? Are you only a participant when you're at the fucking Gap? [laughter] Are you only a participant when you're at the cashier? And the analogy shows just shows how little he understands about insurance itself.</p>
                        <p>22:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:00 Peter: Health Insurance is not a discrete good in the sense that a car is. If you find yourself in desperate need of a car, you can't go to the fucking ER and get a free one.</p>
                        <p>22:08 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:09 Peter: But that is how healthcare works.</p>
                        <p>22:10 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:11 Peter: And you need to account for that distinction, and he just doesn't. I wanna say that he is shitty at economics, but I don't really think that that's what's happening here. I think that he's just manufacturing whatever arbitrary shit he can.</p>
                        <p>22:22 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>22:23 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>22:25 Peter: There is a real extent to which this decision emanates directly from Fox News.</p>
                        <p>22:30 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>22:31 Peter: So first, the fixation on the Individual Mandate comes from conservative media, and the arguments, the arguments made at oral argument, the arguments made in briefing, by the plaintiffs are kind of broad legal reflections of the sort of outrage of the conservative base.</p>
                        <p>22:53 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>22:53 Peter: And a huge amount of this opinion, including Roberts' distinction between economic activity and economic inactivity is stuff that is just yanked from conservative culture and media. That particular argument was designed by Randy Barnett, who was just a weirdo, crank libertarian professor, who nonetheless has incredible sway on the right. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>23:18 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>23:20 Peter: And these things are pulled directly out of someone's ass.</p>
                        <p>23:23 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:25 Peter: And thrown onto fucking Hannity and Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh.</p>
                        <p>23:31 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>23:31 Peter: And the extent to which there is a direct tie between that media culture and the opinions of the five conservatives cannot be overstated.</p>
                        <p>23:40 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:40 Peter: These are not a different type of intellectual or a different type of thinker. They are putting a fancy intellectual gloss on the thoughts of Sean Hannity.</p>
                        <p>23:50 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>23:51 Peter: And Roberts also states that the fact that the court has never confronted a circumstance where citizens were being made to purchase a product, implies that it might be unconstitutional, which... [chuckle] First of all, the dissent points out that that's not true. Right? That the court has upheld such affirmative impositions in the Commerce Clause context in the past but also, "What"? [laughter] I don't even understand. Like, if the court has never seen this before, then it's shady or something, like that's the argument.</p>
                        <p>24:19 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:20 Peter: So, Neal Katyal, hotshot attorney, briefly Obama's Solicitor General, has argued in front of Supreme Court, many a time in that capacity and otherwise. He wrote shortly after the decision that the reasoning used by the Court implies that any time Congress passes a statute that is unique or novel, that might be unconstitutional under Roberts' reasoning.</p>
                        <p>24:41 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:41 Peter: Great point.</p>
                        <p>24:42 Michael: Yup, you got it. You nailed it, Neal.</p>
                        <p>24:44 Rhiannon: Yeah, good job Neal. What's next?</p>
                        <p>24:46 Peter: He also says...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>24:48 Rhiannon: Ohh...</p>
                        <p>24:48 Michael: Tell us more.</p>
                        <p>24:49 Peter: "While Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion that was apolitical and deserves much praise for its statesmanship,"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>24:57 Peter: Now, I cut off the rest of that sentence, because it's not important.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:05 Peter: So, Katyal also praised and supported the nominations of both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.</p>
                        <p>25:10 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>25:11 Peter: And I mean, he might be one of the better examples of just how deeply poisoned the brains of otherwise smart people become, once they are lawyers' brains.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:23 Peter: I wanna mention something else.</p>
                        <p>25:25 Michael: Speaking of diseased brains...</p>
                        <p>25:26 Peter: Speaking of diseased brains, Antonin Scalia... That oral argument asks the government lawyers, "Doesn't this mean that the government could make you buy broccoli?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>25:36 Rhiannon: Oh my god.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>25:37 Peter: And this caught on to the point where Roberts includes it implicitly in his opinion.</p>
                        <p>25:46 Michael: Yeah, he does.</p>
                        <p>25:47 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[video playback]</p>
                        <p>25:47 Michael: "Everybody has to buy food. Therefore everybody's in the market. Therefore you can make people buy broccoli."</p>
                        <p>25:53 Peter: And my response to that is, first of all, maybe, but probably not, mostly because the analysis should be about how connected the law is with the market, and the link between health insurance market and broccoli [chuckle] is a little more tenuous than the link between the health insurance market and fucking health insurance.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:18 Peter: And also, something that conservatives love to say in these cases, when they're upholding an insane state law is they'll be like, "Look, this law might be silly and it might even be awful, but that doesn't mean that it's unconstitutional."</p>
                        <p>26:33 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>26:33 Peter: This is something that Clarence Thomas loves to do in gay rights cases, where he's like, "Look, I'm no homophobe. But unfortunately, they can do this."</p>
                        <p>26:39 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:40 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>26:42 Peter: But here is Scalia doing the exact opposite, right? All he's trying to do is say, "Isn't this silly?" One other thing I'll throw in is, no one argues with the fact that a state could make you do it, right?</p>
                        <p>26:52 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>26:53 Peter: A state could make you buy broccoli.</p>
                        <p>26:53 Michael: Yup.</p>
                        <p>26:54 Peter: It would be an absurd law. Yeah, but again, not necessarily speaking to its constitutionality. Shut the fuck up, Antonin Scalia. [laughter] Maybe you should eat some broccoli sometime...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>27:04 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:05 Michael: Maybe you'd still be with us.</p>
                        <p>27:05 Peter: Antonin Scalia [chuckle] would be on the court [laughter] if he had eaten some broccoli, some government-mandated broccoli would have been real good for him.</p>
                        <p>27:12 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>27:12 Michael: Stop it with the fucking steaks and the oysters.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>27:18 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:18 Michael: Get on a treadmill.</p>
                        <p>27:19 Rhiannon: This is a good example of the utility and effectiveness of a slippery slope argument. So, John Roberts is doing it in this opinion, Scalia is doing this slippery slope thing, and I think it makes it obvious that you don't have substantive legal arguments.</p>
                        <p>27:35 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>27:35 Rhiannon: And rules and stuff that you're sort of intellectually accessing when you're writing these opinions, if your opinion is like, "The government can't make me buy vegetables, so why try do this.</p>
                        <p>27:45 Michael: Right. It's just scoring rhetorical points.</p>
                        <p>27:48 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>27:50 Michael: It's not intellectually rigorous.</p>
                        <p>27:50 Rhiannon: Yup.</p>
                        <p>27:51 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>27:51 Michael: And Scalia, he's an interesting case study in this case. Because a lot of law professors and legal observers, people who write about the Court, were pretty convinced that he was gonna side with the government here.</p>
                        <p>28:05 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:05 Michael: And they had a reason, right? They had grounds for this, which was another recent case, Gonzales v. Raich which was like a medical marijuana case, where Scalia was like, "Yeah, of course the government can regulate if somebody's growing marijuana for themselves." And that...</p>
                        <p>28:22 Peter: Under the Commerce Clause.</p>
                        <p>28:23 Michael: Under the Commerce Clause.</p>
                        <p>28:25 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>28:26 Michael: That might not be commerce and it might not be interstate, but there's a comprehensive scheme here that requires reaching some stuff that's not interstate commerce in order to be comprehensive and not be undercut. And people were like, "Oh, fucking Scalia, he's painted into a corner, he's got no out, he's totally confined by his own logic," and well [chuckle] how did that turn out?</p>
                        <p>28:53 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>28:54 Michael: How did that go?</p>
                        <p>28:54 Peter: Well, Antonin Scalia wouldn't risk being a huge fucking hypocrite, would he?</p>
                        <p>28:57 Michael: No, no.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:58 Peter: Surely he will side with the government here.</p>
                        <p>29:01 Rhiannon: Surely he's more principled than that.</p>
                        <p>29:03 Michael: Yes. We say a lot that legal formalism is bullshit, but this is the point. This stuff doesn't actually confine judges.</p>
                        <p>29:13 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:14 Michael: The judges do whatever the fuck they want. And in this case, he says, "Well okay, I said that then, but you know, I can come up with some reason to ignore it." And it's not just Scalia here, it's also Roberts with what we've talked about before, which is the canon of constitutional avoidance, which roughly speaking says the court should avoid striking down laws as unconstitutional, if it can. And Roberts didn't have to do any of this commerce analysis that we've just been going through.</p>
                        <p>29:46 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:46 Michael: And it's in fact, very weird that he did it.</p>
                        <p>29:47 Peter: Because he had already upheld that has a tax.</p>
                        <p>29:49 Michael: Right, exactly. And so he could have just said, "Look, it's amenable to an interpretation as a tax and that settles it, and that's the end of it." And the history and operation of the "Canon of Constitutional Avoidance," this is precisely the sort of esoteric legal formalism that we usually ignore 'cause we don't think it meaningfully constrains the Justices.</p>
                        <p>30:09 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:09 Michael: But it's worth discussing here because...</p>
                        <p>30:10 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>30:13 Michael: Roberts uses it to sneak in his reactionary bullshit under a veneer of moderation.</p>
                        <p>30:18 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:19 Rhiannon: Right and the rule is actually that the court should avoid weighing in on constitutional questions if it doesn't have to. So, once you determine that the commerce issue was questionable, if there was an alternative rationale to use, to avoid ruling on that, he's supposed to take that alternative rationale. So, in this case, that's the tax rationale.</p>
                        <p>30:37 Michael: Right, exactly. This is one of the oldest principles of the court. It goes back to 1800 and back then, they used it the way Roberts does here. You start like, "Oh, is this interpretation constitutional? Yes? Okay, No? Well, then we move on to this other interpretation," and if not, then down the line, until you run out of interpretations and it's struck down, or you find one that works.</p>
                        <p>31:03 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:03 Michael: So in 1909, the Supreme Court explicitly shifted gears on this and looked at the old rule and said, "Look, that can't be right." What Roberts is doing right here, can't be the proper way to analyze these questions.</p>
                        <p>31:14 Peter: Yes.</p>
                        <p>31:16 Michael: And what we have to do instead is say, "Look, if there's one interpretation that gives rise to constitutional questions and one that does not, then we take that second interpretation, that second construction.</p>
                        <p>31:29 Peter: Avoid fucking with the Constitution where you can.</p>
                        <p>31:32 Michael: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>31:33 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:33 Michael: And so this is like, it's fucking devious. He makes it seem like he's being non-partisan and principled and going out of his way to follow the standard practice, but what he's actually doing is really just judicial activism. There's no other way to describe it, to do something very reactionary with the Commerce Clause.</p>
                        <p>31:51 Peter: So, I think there's a broad question that a lot of our episodes and a lot of the things we say, sort of inherently asks, which is, are they faking it?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:03 Peter: Like when John Roberts gives these ludicrous definitions of regulating commerce, is he snickering to himself like, "These stupid fucks," or...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:17 Michael: Does he think he's like sliding one in by us.</p>
                        <p>32:17 Peter: Is he a true believer?</p>
                        <p>32:20 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:20 Peter: And I think the answer to that, 95% of the time, is that they are true believers.</p>
                        <p>32:26 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:26 Peter: Just like anyone else, they are not super conscious of their biases and they're sort of rolling with it, and part of their brain is guiding them towards the outcomes that they want, just like anyone else. If you've ever been in an argument with someone on a message board, it's not drastically different than that. [chuckle] It's a lot closer to that, than anyone would like.</p>
                        <p>32:48 Michael: Right. I mean look, it's very easy to convince yourself of something that's flattering and what you want. Like I'm sure that I'm like a 10. [laughter] If I just could talk to Emma Watson for five minutes...</p>
                        <p>33:01 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:04 Michael: I would fucking...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>33:06 Rhiannon: You got it in the bag bro.</p>
                        <p>33:08 Peter: I believe that about you too dude.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>33:10 Peter: I think you could do it.</p>
                        <p>33:11 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:11 Michael: Thanks buddy.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>33:15 Peter: Yeah, I think that there's a real, I don't wanna do too much armchair psychology, right? [chuckle] But there's a lot to be said for the ability of the human mind to convince itself of the propriety of the conclusions it had snapped to in an instant, right?</p>
                        <p>33:31 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:32 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:32 Peter: And I don't think that John Roberts is taking a huge step back with a fucking giant white board with an evil plan on it or anything.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>33:41 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:41 Peter: He's just a slave to his biases and not willing to confront them in any meaningful way.</p>
                        <p>33:48 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:48 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that's right.</p>
                        <p>33:48 Peter: And for our purposes, the distinction doesn't matter. And that's why I'm gonna never stop calling these people fucking evil and stupid or whatever, because their good faith in these situations, maybe it exists, but it doesn't matter for the fucking millions of people, that are under their yoke.</p>
                        <p>34:08 Michael: [chuckle] Right.</p>
                        <p>34:08 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:08 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>34:09 Peter: Alright. So there's a part two to the ObamaCare case, and that is the Medicaid expansion. And this part of ObamaCare simply expanded Medicaid coverage, Medicaid, you know provides health insurance to the impoverished, to a broader subset of the population, up to those making 138% of the federal poverty level. The specific part of the law challenged here is not really the expansion per se, but part of its administration. Medicaid is ostensibly a federal program, but it is administered by the states who rely on federal funding to pay for it. So, the ACA, ObamaCare required that states comply with the new alterations to Medicaid or else lose potentially all of their Medicaid funding.</p>
                        <p>34:57 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>34:58 Peter: And the argument is that this is unconstitutional because it's coercive. It's long been established that the federal government is allowed to attach conditions to funding given to the states, as long as those conditions are appropriately related enough to the purpose of the spending. And the definitive case on that is South Dakota v. Dole, a 1987 case which held that the federal government could require states to raise their drinking age to 21, if those states wanted to receive federal highway funds. And it said that it could, you know that those things are related enough, drinking, highways. You know, the drunk driving was the concern, but that case also had a throwaway line saying that if the feds left the states with "no practical choice other than to accept a condition, that law could be potentially struck down as coercive."</p>
                        <p>35:50 Rhiannon: In basic terms, the argument is that, the states here couldn't realistically forego all of their Medicaid spending because it's too important.</p>
                        <p>36:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:00 Rhiannon: So, the law is coercive.</p>
                        <p>36:02 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>36:03 Rhiannon: And he has a quote here on this, "In this case, the financial "inducement" Congress has chosen is much more than "relatively mild encouragement." It is a gun to the head."</p>
                        <p>36:16 Peter: It's literally free money.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:19 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>36:20 Rhiannon: Yeah, calm down. In the episode on Shelby County, the voting rights case, we talked about John Roberts and his awful analogies, [laughter] and here's another one. This drama queen shit, that's not good argument. [chuckle] This is hyperbole.</p>
                        <p>36:35 Peter: To say the least. So, it's not just that the court took this throwaway line and used it to manufacture a doctrine with massive implications for the health care of millions of people, although that is important. This is fundamentally absurd, right?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:52 Peter: The federal government designs and funds the Medicaid program and administration is handled by the states. States can opt out, but none currently do, because it's a huge amount of money to benefit your citizens. This is a circumstance where the federal government is saying, "Okay, here are the new terms of the Medicaid program. If you don't agree with those terms, you don't get funding for the program."</p>
                        <p>37:14 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:14 Peter: To say, that is a reasonable requirement, is to put it lightly. Right?</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>37:18 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:18 Peter: It's not just reasonable, it's the only conceivable way, you could run a program like this. The feds are saying, "Okay, here's the money and here's the program we want you to use it for," and the states are like, "Cool dude. Thanks for the money, but we're actually gonna go another direction with the program."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>37:34 Peter: And the court is saying, "Yeah, they should be allowed to do that." It's absurd.</p>
                        <p>37:38 Michael: Yeah, it can't be the case that Congress is constitutionally prohibited from ending Medicaid. Right?</p>
                        <p>37:43 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:44 Michael: And it also can't be the case that Congress would then a week later or whatever, constitutionally be prohibited from passing a new more generous version of Medicaid that looks like this.</p>
                        <p>37:55 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:56 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:57 Michael: But the court's saying, "Well, yeah, sure, maybe you could do that in two steps, but if you wanna collapse that into one step and make it an amendment to the existing law, that's a no go." It's fucking absurd.</p>
                        <p>38:06 Peter: Yeah. Alright, so to highlight a particular absurdity here, you could using the reasoning of the court, avoid this being unconstitutional if you simply established federal administration of Medicaid. Right?</p>
                        <p>38:20 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>38:21 Peter: Right now, the Federal Government gives money to the states, and they're like, "You administer this under these terms." But if the Federal Government were to eliminate the state's role, create a massive sprawling federal complex spanning the entire nation, under the court's reasoning, that is a more appropriate use of federal power than delegating the administration to the states.</p>
                        <p>38:45 Michael: And simultaneously shrinking the size of all the state governments while massively expanding the size of the federal government would be more respective of the federal state balance.</p>
                        <p>38:58 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>39:00 Michael: Then just...</p>
                        <p>39:00 Peter: Absurd on its face. It's absurd on its face.</p>
                        <p>39:02 Rhiannon: Yeah, and so there are some definite legal implications of this decision, some consequences that we maybe not necessarily have seen totally play out yet.</p>
                        <p>39:11 Peter: No, no.</p>
                        <p>39:12 Rhiannon: But this case opens the door for absurdity all around. One area that's called into question is environmentalism. So the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has long denied federal funding to States who refuse to meet air quality standards. But following NFIB, this was challenged by such upstanding organizations as the Texas Pipeline Association, shout-out, and the Gas Producers Association.</p>
                        <p>39:43 Peter: Oh yeah.</p>
                        <p>39:45 Rhiannon: These guys are saying that the EPA tying those federal funds to states complying with the air quality standards, that that's coercive, just like the states are saying in NFIB.</p>
                        <p>39:58 Michael: Very sympathetic plaintiffs there.</p>
                        <p>40:00 Peter: Well, I hope that the Gas Producers Association is doing okay.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>40:03 Michael: Yeah, that's...</p>
                        <p>40:06 Peter: More of the business jargon [chuckle] plaintiffs, Texas Pipeline Association, Gas Producers Association, start throwing in some awful commodities [chuckle] like fucking gas and shit, and it gets even worse. Just, like, the Human Blood Association.</p>
                        <p>40:22 Michael: That is very sick.</p>
                        <p>40:27 Peter: [chuckle] These people are fucking psychotic.</p>
                        <p>40:27 Rhiannon: Human Blood Association...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>40:30 Rhiannon: Yeah, and so the challenge to the Clean Air Act that failed in that case, but a similar litigation has sprung up elsewhere. Now, another area where NFIB opens up some serious legal questions is lots of civil rights statutes are enacted under Congress's spending power, and even though they've been upheld following this kind of challenge in the past, this NFIB decision maybe opens that question back up. So, for example, Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. Title IV prohibits race discrimination in federally funded programs. And another big statute, the Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination based on disability in federally funded programs. All of those statutes condition receipt of federal funds on the state's agreement to follow these laws about non-discrimination.</p>
                        <p>41:27 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>41:28 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>41:29 Rhiannon: And so now if a plaintiff wants to say those things are coercive, the NFIB decision opens that up to like, "Is the court gonna agree with that?"</p>
                        <p>41:38 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>41:39 Rhiannon: And I think that's scary because our nation's history shows clearly that states can't be trusted with treating their citizens like they're human beings. States have to be...</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>41:49 Michael: Some citizens.</p>
                        <p>41:52 Peter: And some states.</p>
                        <p>41:53 Rhiannon: Right, right. States have to be incentivized to do so or they won't.</p>
                        <p>41:55 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>41:55 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>41:56 Rhiannon: And also casually, they'll start a civil war over it, they don't give a fuck.</p>
                        <p>41:58 Michael: For real.</p>
                        <p>42:01 Rhiannon: This decision in NFIB makes it easier for states to say that being incentivized to do right by their citizens is intolerable coercion.</p>
                        <p>42:10 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>42:11 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>42:11 Peter: And just, I can't stress it enough, fundamentally absurd. The government is saying, "Here's this money and here's what we want you to do for it." And the court is saying, "No, no, no, no, that's too much money. You can't tell them what they have to do with it." It's absurd.</p>
                        <p>42:28 Michael: And the key distinction that Roberts hangs his hat on is to hold this unconstitutional is he says that, "Expanding the definition of who is eligible for Medicaid actually counts as a separate and distinct program for Medicaid," which is just such obvious bullshit.</p>
                        <p>42:48 Peter: This has come to be emblematic of how political the Roberts Court is and how crafty Roberts can be.</p>
                        <p>42:55 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>42:56 Peter: Although I don't think he tricked anyone who really understands the law, he has a reputation now as someone who's willing to cross the aisle, which as we talked about before, not only is that not something he does, he does it worse than almost anyone.</p>
                        <p>43:12 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>43:13 Michael: Right. But this case actually got him a reputation with some of the fucking stupider members of the Republican base as being like the traitor, the Republican traitor.</p>
                        <p>43:21 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:22 Peter: They think that he sold them out because their political motivations are incredibly narrow and petty, and he has a longer standing project in mind.</p>
                        <p>43:34 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>43:34 Peter: One thing that we want you to take away from this, and a lot of our cases is, you don't have to accept the premise that the court presents to you, or the premises that the court presents to you.</p>
                        <p>43:42 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>43:42 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>43:44 Peter: Constitutional avoidance, textualism, legislative prerogative, judicial overreach, these aren't doctrines or concepts that the court rigidly or consistently applies. They are tools in a judge's arsenal to get where they are trying to go.</p>
                        <p>44:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>44:01 Peter: They're selectively deployed and they're often deployed in bad faith, and if you try to formalistically parse exactly why they're being deployed in one instance and not another, you're not being a good lawyer, you're not being clever, you are just a fucking mark.</p>
                        <p>44:14 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>44:16 Peter: And I wanna mention one thing about this case in particular, and about Medicaid expansion, which is that, giving states the ability to functionally opt out of the Medicaid expansion, which is what this decision ultimately does, has almost certainly been directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people and the decline in the mental and physical well-being of many, many more.</p>
                        <p>44:38 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>44:39 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:40 Peter: Multiple studies found that expansion was associated with significantly greater increases in overall cancer diagnosis rates, early stage diagnosis rates, and higher utilization of cancer surgeries. Recent evidence demonstrates that Medicaid expansion, in states where they did expand it, have seen improvements in access to medications and services for the treatment of behavioral health, and I'm just giving a couple of examples, right?</p>
                        <p>45:03 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>45:05 Peter: At the feet of all of this pseudo-formalistic gibberish lies vast amounts of actual human suffering.</p>
                        <p>45:13 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>45:14 Peter: And that's the result of this case and a fucking million others, and a legal system that does not meaningfully reckon with that, is simply not adequate.</p>
                        <p>45:21 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>45:21 Rhiannon: Tell 'em, yes.</p>
                        <p>45:24 Michael: Fuckin' preach.</p>
                        <p>45:24 Peter: It is unbelievable how many programs that are designed for the well-being of especially the poorest and most vulnerable citizens in this country are tied to programs like this, right?</p>
                        <p>45:36 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>45:37 Peter: And it's hard for me to imagine that, especially as the court gets increasingly polarized, in the event especially that RBG dies while Trump is president or some other fucking monster is president, you will see these arguments start to crystallize and start to encroach upon more and more federal power, which means giving power to states and taking away funding from programs that help the needy.</p>
                        <p>46:07 Michael: And it's important to emphasize the Roberts' two-step that we discussed, where he lays the groundwork in an opinion that seems pleasing to liberals and then uses that groundwork to fucking gut them, that's about appearance. That's not formally necessary. And the other conservatives of the court have shown a willingness to skip any appearance of propriety or moderation and just go right for the fucking throat. And the fact that Roberts, we strongly suspect this is just the first volley for him, we shouldn't be concerned about the specifics of this decision, because one of our points is that the actual legal arguments are really ancillary, right?</p>
                        <p>46:55 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>46:56 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>46:57 Michael: It's the political agenda, and it's the movement's goals that matter. They'll find arguments to get them there, and this case isn't really different. It's just the way that Roberts slow rolls the process.</p>
                        <p>47:06 Peter: Right. So one of the lingering questions here is: Where does this leave us for the next five, 10, 20 years in terms of legislative options for healthcare?</p>
                        <p>47:18 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>47:19 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>47:19 Michael: And in the Democratic primaries, there were a lot of different plans that were thrown out, and sort of ironically a little bit, the more moderate plans under the logic of this opinion are maybe more vulnerable.</p>
                        <p>47:33 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>47:33 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>47:34 Michael: Like Medicare for All could look a lot like social security, which is definitely robust and resistant to this sort of opinion, whereas Pete Buttigieg's middle ground, where you have a public option that people are auto-enrolled in, looks a lot like a more strenuously enforced mandate, the type of thing that the court might be, under this logics, very suspicious of.</p>
                        <p>47:54 Rhiannon: Right. You wouldn't even be buying it, you would automatically be enrolled.</p>
                        <p>47:58 Michael: Right. The government would be just buying it for you with your money. [chuckle] Oh my fucking...</p>
                        <p>[overlapping conversation]</p>
                        <p>48:06 Peter: Yeah, but the other side of that though, is that if this court finds an opportunity to strike down Medicare for All, even though it's not susceptible to these arguments in the same way, I fuckin' promise you...</p>
                        <p>48:19 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>48:20 Peter: They will.</p>
                        <p>48:21 Peter: I think that's right.</p>
                        <p>48:22 Rhiannon: Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
                        <p>48:23 Peter: And they'll probably do it in a similar way to what they did here, because this is like the Roberts' special, you don't strike it down, you gut it.</p>
                        <p>48:30 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>48:30 Peter: And that's what they did to ObamaCare, that's what they're going to do to Medicare for All, if the option is ever presented to them, which...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>48:43 Peter: Hell world. So no, probably won't happen. But yeah, I think it's important to realize that they're not constrained by their reasoning, but if you look at the reasoning, it makes more sense that Medicare for All would get by it than some half-washed bullshit like Pete Buttigieg's plan.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>49:03 Peter: Alright, next episode is Trump v. Hawaii, better known as the Travel Ban case, or in less PC terms, the Muslim Ban case. We're going hard, and it's our first Trump Administration case. Obviously, we're big supporters, but in this particular instance, [chuckle] we are not fans of the position his administration took.</p>
                        <p>49:29 Michael: Right. [chuckle] This one narrow case.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>49:34 Michael: 5-4 is presented by Westwood One and Prologue Projects. This episode was produced by Katya Kumkova with editorial oversight by Leon Neyfakh and Andrew Parsons. Our artwork is by Teddy Blanks at Chips NY and our theme song is by Spatial Relations.</p>

                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We'll hear argument first, this morning in case 12-96, Shelby County versus Holder. Mr. Ryan?</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:07 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone. This is Leon Neyfakh, co-creator of Fiasco and Slow Burn. On today's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about Shelby County v. Holder, a decision that rolled back federal protections for minority voters.</p>
                        <p>00:23 [Archival]: By 5-4, the US Supreme Court today took the teeth out of a law enacted nearly 50 years ago.</p>
                        <p>00:28 Leon Neyfakh: Before Shelby, some states had to get clearance from the federal government before changing their election laws, but in this ruling, the court held that it was unfair to single out states just because of their long history of racist policies.</p>
                        <p>00:41 [Archival]: It is wrong to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.</p>
                        <p>[applause]</p>
                        <p>00:53 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>01:05 Peter: Alright, welcome to 5-4 podcasts where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court decisions that have washed over American life, like waves over the rocks, reducing once proud boulders to sandy rubble. [chuckle] Episode four, and my metaphors to open the show are getting unbelievably intricate. [laughter] I am Peter, Twitter's The Law Boy. I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:34 Michael: Hey, everybody.</p>
                        <p>01:34 Peter: And from Austin, Texas Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:37 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:38 Peter: And we are the only legal podcast featuring a woman, a man and a boy.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>01:48 Peter: And today we are covering Shelby County v. Holder, a case that asks a lot of big questions like, "Is there still racism?" And follow-up questions like, "Are you sure? Are you sure there's still racism?" It's a case that dismantled key protections within the Voting Rights Act of 1965, allowing states to implement discriminatory restrictions on the voting rights of minorities. This hits on, I think, some of the key themes of the podcast, not only is the court expressing the sort of willful blindness to racism and how it manifests, that you'd expect from a Rush Limbaugh, perhaps, but it's a great example of Conservative hypocrisy about legislating from the bench and overreach of the judiciary into legislative prerogative. And it's also our introduction on the podcast to Chief Justice, John Roberts, who has a very particular sort of approach to these cases. He was appointed in 2005 under George W. Bush after the failed nomination of Harriet Miers, which we'll one day do an entire podcast about.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:00 Michael: You know, at the time, I think everybody felt like we dodged a bullet there. But I feel like actually we took the bullet on that one.</p>
                        <p>03:07 Peter: That's right, that's right. And I think probably the best summation of how he presents his judicial philosophy is, at his appointment hearing, he said he doesn't have a comprehensive judicial philosophy. He just calls balls and strikes. He's an umpire, a legal umpire calling balls and strikes. [chuckle] That's how he thinks about the law or how he talks about the law. He also recently said, sort of along similar lines, Trump was referring probably on Twitter to Clinton judges, Obama judges, and he said, "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges, what we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them," which is super wrong.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:51 Rhiannon: Yeah, I'm doing the jerk off motion like.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:55 Peter: If that is true, then the fact that each president has nominated only people who agree with him politically over the course of the past 40 years would be one of the most incredible coincidences in the history of mankind.</p>
                        <p>04:14 Michael: Mitch McConnell holding dead Scalia's seat open for a year would be totally incomprehensible.</p>
                        <p>04:20 Peter: Yeah, it didn't make any sense at all.</p>
                        <p>04:21 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:22 Peter: Why was he doing that?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:26 Peter: Yeah. So Roberts has a vision of the court as an impartial body, but it's important to recognize that his vision is not substantive, it's about optics and aesthetics.</p>
                        <p>04:37 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:38 Peter: He doesn't care about the court actually being an impartial body and being above politics, he cares about the court being perceived that way.</p>
                        <p>04:46 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:46 Peter: So, as a result, he's from time to time hedged on certain politically visible cases and sort of taken a more center of the road approach than his fellow Conservative justices but he's always careful to lay the ground work for Conservative arguments down the road. I think the most prominent example of this, which we're gonna cover in a couple of episodes is the ObamaCare decision, which upheld ObamaCare itself on narrow and technical grounds, but made a Commerce Clause argument that I guarantee you, is going to be leveraged over the course of the next decade to shut down attempts at Medicare for All, Green New Deal and whatever else the left has planned after Bernie Sanders wins the 2020 election. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>05:31 Michael: A very serious poison pill.</p>
                        <p>05:35 Peter: I mean, absolutely, it's going to be a massive obstacle.</p>
                        <p>05:38 Michael: And that's sort of the Robert's MO, right? We called it when we were chatting about this episode before, the Roberts two-step, which is he makes himself look moderate and not reactionary by just taking things a little slow, but you still end up in the same place and Shelby County is actually a good example of that as well. This was the second case on the Voting Rights Act that his court had heard. And in the first case, they basically upheld the law entirely, but they left some little warnings in there that they thought, this was constitutionally suspect, so that a few years later, they could come back to it and it would look more judicious, right?</p>
                        <p>06:17 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>06:18 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think that every time he speaks publicly, John Roberts' obsession with the optics of impartiality are really clear. So speaking at the University of Minnesota, some time back, he says the same kind of thing about balls and strikes. We don't sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we don't caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest, we serve one nation. I have a visceral reaction to this idea of service. [chuckle] Like that first of all, that impartiality is real at all, right? Like that's a myth, and then also that you serve the people with impartiality. It's gross and he's talking about it constantly.</p>
                        <p>06:56 Peter: Yeah, he also at a, 'cause he was... In his duties as chief justice, I don't know if you guys know this but the chief justice gets paid like nine grand extra a year.</p>
                        <p>07:05 Michael: Oh wow.</p>
                        <p>07:05 Peter: Yeah, and they each make a quarter million, but he makes like 260 something. And [chuckle] he was overseeing the impeachment process, which is his duty as chief justice, and he... The impeachment was very... The senators were treating it like a spectacle, and he gave a speech that was like, "Keep in mind that you are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:34 Peter: It's like, "No dude, I think they had it right, actually." This is a fucking disgusting mess.</p>
                        <p>07:39 Michael: Have you ever listened to the fucking clowns that [chuckle] populate the US senate? Trying to talk extemporaneously.</p>
                        <p>07:46 Rhiannon: Yeah, so apparently, he gave an interview, I think to just C-SPAN or something, where he talked about how if he's at the Supreme Court late at night by himself, he takes time to look at the portraits of the past chief justices, his 16 predecessors, and he says "They're probably looking down at me... "</p>
                        <p>08:09 Peter: He absolutely doesn't do that. Alright, guys.</p>
                        <p>08:09 Rhiannon: He says, "They're probably looking down at me with either bemusement or amazement. From time to time, I find it a useful reminder of the role of the court and the role of the chief justice." So he loves this shit, he revels in it, but I...</p>
                        <p>08:20 Peter: What he does is he looks at them and he's like, "I'm so fucking cool."</p>
                        <p>08:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
                        <p>08:25 Peter: "They're gonna do a painting of me, it's gonna look so fucking good." So we should talk about the Voting Rights Act and how we got here. And I'll hand it off to you, Rhi. I think step one is slavery, and I don't know if our listeners are aware of this, but slavery was a huge thing, and if you check the Wikipedia, you'll be shocked. [chuckle] But after slavery, there's an important history. Rhiannon, if you wanna fill everyone in.</p>
                        <p>08:57 Rhiannon: Yeah, it's a voting rights case, so I think it's worth it to talk about how we get to the Voting Rights Act, which is the legislation that's being challenged here. Broadly speaking, the Constitution allows states to determine their own voter eligibility standards, so that means an individual state can say, "You need to register to vote in this way," or, "This is what you need to do to be eligible to vote in this state," and that can be different from the standards in another state. A good example of this is that some states have voter ID laws and some don't, but let me tell you something, the states sometimes have a real problem with doing this in a non-racist way.</p>
                        <p>09:36 Peter: Oh, any states in particular?</p>
                        <p>09:38 Michael: No way.</p>
                        <p>09:40 Rhiannon: I think you could probably guess, but they're the ones that are like below the Mason Dixon.</p>
                        <p>09:45 Peter: Okay. That arbitrary line we know and love.</p>
                        <p>09:48 Rhiannon: Right, [chuckle] so after the Civil War, there was, shall we say, a slight loss of confidence in the ability of the southern states to handle this responsibility of setting voter eligibility standards. And so several constitutional amendments get passed. It's the 13th Amendment that prohibit slavery, you can't have slaves anymore.</p>
                        <p>10:10 Peter: Well, asterisk, [chuckle] prisoners.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:14 Rhiannon: Right, right, right.</p>
                        <p>10:14 Peter: That's another episode.</p>
                        <p>10:15 Rhiannon: That's another episode. The 14th Amendment guarantees due process and equal protection. We've already talked about that one, a couple of times. And then the 15th Amendment states that the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. So unfortunately though, reconstruction and every era after that was...</p>
                        <p>10:42 Peter: A little racist.</p>
                        <p>10:43 Michael: Like reactionary?</p>
                        <p>10:43 Rhiannon: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like incredibly fucking racist.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:49 Peter: Just mind blowing amounts of racism, yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:52 Rhiannon: Right, right, violent and ubiquitous racism. States were using the power to set their own voter eligibility standards to relegate and exclude the black vote. And so, suppression of the black vote in the South, it's ubiquitous, it's aggressive. We're talking about things like implementing the requirement that voters take a literacy test or pay poll taxes, or you have to show that you own property, even more completely arbitrary stuff like moral character tests, stuff like that, and not to mention literal campaigns of violence to keep people from coming to vote.</p>
                        <p>11:27 Michael: Is it widely known that this is the origin of the term, grandfathered in?</p>
                        <p>11:31 Peter: I know that, but I think that's some law school shit.</p>
                        <p>11:34 Michael: We use the term pretty ubiquitously now, but the idea was that, "Well, look, these very confusing literacy tests and things like that, that are property requirements, yeah, they're gonna exclude black people, but they're also gonna exclude lots of poor white people." And so they would add this provision that, "Well, if your grandfather was able to vote, then you are able to vote," which meant, "If you're not descended from slaves, don't worry about it, we don't care. It's only slave descendants that have to jump through all these fucking hoops."</p>
                        <p>12:06 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>12:07 Rhiannon: Yeah, one day maybe it's another episode, too, but we will talk about how complicit the Supreme Court actually was in all of this. The court stepped in more than once to prevent the federal government from protecting the rights of black people in the South.</p>
                        <p>12:21 Peter: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>12:22 Rhiannon: Yeah. It's all thematically consistent. And so prior to the Civil War amendments, prior to the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, the federal government was very limited in its ability to regulate the relationship between individual states and their citizens. So the 14th and 15th Amendments empower Congress to do just that, and for the express purpose of protecting racial minorities. It's aimed squarely at the states. It says, "No state shall make or enforce any law, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." And so these amendments actually create a new enumerated power for Congress to legislate. Congress has the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</p>
                        <p>13:02 Michael: Right, which is an important point for this case, but we're gonna talk a lot in this podcast about the 14th Amendment, usually in the context of courts enforcing it, but it's important to remember that the 14th Amendment and 15th Amendment are first and foremost about empowering Congress, and that matters here, because what you have is the court facing off with Congress about its legislative powers under the 14th Amendment.</p>
                        <p>13:28 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>13:29 Rhiannon: Yeah, exactly. And so, yeah, as we transition historically through these different legal structures, so for slavery and then into the legal framework of Jim Crow, then we have the mass mobilization and the Civil Rights Movement. So after Martin Luther King's march on Selma in February of 1965, President Lyndon Johnson finally gets on board and calls for legislation, later that same year, we get the Voting Rights Act.</p>
                        <p>13:57 Peter: Yeah, yeah, so the Voting Rights Act of 1965, I think if you look at it broadly has general provisions that apply everywhere in the US and prevent certain voting rules and practices that discriminate. And then you have the specific provisions which are what matters here for this case that apply only to certain states and local governments who have historically been problematic, maybe haven't been great on the race issue in the past. Those jurisdictions comprise about 25% of the country so the Voting Rights Act, Section 5 contains, of the Act, contains a pre-clearance requirement that requires those state and local governments to obtain approval from the federal government, specifically either the Department of Justice or the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, before changes to their voting laws or practices can be made, to ensure that those changes do not violate the 15th Amendment by preventing minorities from voting. And Section 4B of the Voting Rights Act contains a formula that determines which jurisdictions this applies to. So the formula covers jurisdictions that as of initially was November 1964, and then November 1968, and then 1972, maintained a prohibited test or device as a condition of registering to vote or voting and had a voting age population of which less than 50% either were registered to vote or actually voted in that year's presidential election.</p>
                        <p>15:35 Michael: So basically, it's jurisdictions that have been making it difficult to vote and the result have been a lot of people not voting.</p>
                        <p>15:41 Peter: Yeah, that's right and to give some historical context here, Congress tried over the course of the late, very late '50s and early '60s to restrict discriminatory voting rights practices. They would see a discriminatory practice and then crack down on it and the result, in essence, was always the same, the states and the local governments would do away with whatever practice was made illegal and replace it with a new one. And the Voting Rights Act was a direct response to that. Congress is finally stepping in and saying, "Okay, okay, no more of this bullshit, if you change your voting laws we wanna see it first."</p>
                        <p>16:17 Michael: Right. It's not just that the states could just change their laws as they go, although they could, it's that by the time the lawsuit is filed and you've gone through all the fucking hearings and compiled all the data, you've had multiple elections under these laws and you have incumbents who can continue to make laws and entrench themselves that were elected under racist and unconstitutional election guidelines.</p>
                        <p>16:43 Peter: Right, so the way that the coverage formula works, the formula that decides which jurisdictions get this kind of added scrutiny is every so often Congress will look at it again and re-authorize it. The most recent reauthorization was in 2006, Congress looks at it, they do a deep dive into whether or not this is still needed, why it's needed etcetera, there's a huge Congressional record, they reauthorize the formula so the same jurisdictions are covered by it and the same jurisdictions are therefore restricted from passing new voting regulations without getting approval from the Feds.</p>
                        <p>17:26 Rhiannon: Yeah, when we say Congress made findings, that means that there were real studies done, there was data and numbers crunched and the result of that is, of all of that information is that Congress reauthorized.</p>
                        <p>17:39 Michael: Right, there was, I think, 15,000 pages of congressional record in six months of hearings in both Houses of Congress. And one thing, I'm not sure if we're gonna talk about this later but I wanted to add it in when we're talking about the formula and the coverage. If a district can show that they've been in compliance for 10 years, they can basically get out of this pre-clearance requirement. And likewise, if a court finds that a district that's not currently covered has been engaging in a lot of problematic behavior, the court can add them to the pre-clearance states and districts.</p>
                        <p>18:14 Peter: Right, I think, which it's a way of saying it's not rigid and merciless, there's a flexibility built into the law.</p>
                        <p>18:19 Michael: Right, we're gonna revisit it in 15 or 25 years, but in the meantime, states that are doing well can get out of here.</p>
                        <p>18:28 Peter: Yeah, yeah, so that brings us to this case, Shelby County, Alabama, named after Isaac Shelby, revolutionary war hero and Governor of Kentucky, way back in, I think, the late 1700s. Ironically, a very progressive abolitionist. [chuckle] No, I'm kidding, he owned slaves. [laughter] And he spent most of his governorship at war with the Indians in Kentucky. So Shelby County is a county with a... It's a problem child district, a history of discrimination but they filed for a declaratory judgment by the court that these parts of the Voting Rights Act exceed Congress' authority under the 14th and 15th amendments and are therefore unconstitutional. And declaratory judgment is basically just requesting a statement from the court about the law, like, "Say this is unconstitutional." It's not about a specific harm upon the county per se, it's just we want you to say that this is unconstitutional. Not the most uncommon thing to do in these sorts of constitutional proceedings. So it's slightly convoluted around the margins but the basic argument they're making is simple, things have changed enough since the statute was passed that the formula that is used to determine which jurisdictions get this extra level of federal scrutiny no longer should apply. And in fact it's so egregious that it's unconstitutional.</p>
                        <p>20:00 Michael: Right, which means that it should never apply to anyone, that it's not just us, that there is no constitutional application of this formula at all.</p>
                        <p>20:09 Peter: Yeah, which is... Alright. [laughter] And the basic way this case shakes out is pretty simple, the court upholds Section 5, which is the pre-clearance requirement itself, like the idea of federal approval being necessary, but strikes down 4B, which has the formula, determining which jurisdictions it applies to. If you're paying attention, Section 5 is useless without section 4B, because Section 5 doesn't apply to any jurisdictions without section 4B. So this is functionally striking down the... It's not the entire act, but it's this entire portion of the act. The arguments here, they're... First, Roberts goes on this long tangent about the importance of state sovereignty and the concepts of federalism. It's the state's rights argument, you might have heard that if you've ever discussed with someone what the Civil War was actually about or whatever, and like yeah, okay, the states do have some level of sovereignty, but it's actually... It's a complete distraction here, the real issue is whether Congress has the authority to regulate the states in this manner under the 14th and 15th Amendments, and the court is trying to build up the importance of state rights for the same reason they do it in every single fucking racist case in Supreme Court history.</p>
                        <p>21:28 Peter: They want to portray their accommodation of racist policies and practices as if it is the side effect of their commitment to state's rights, when in fact it is their central goal. And as we discussed in episode one on Bush v. Gore, their concern with state's rights to control their own elections didn't seem to matter too much when they literally overturned the Florida Supreme Court about its own election laws and procedures and stopped a state recount short to hand the election, a presidential election, to their candidate of choice.</p>
                        <p>22:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:02 Rhiannon: Right, right. And in general, I think people should know that at any discussion in these cases about states' rights or hearing these words, state sovereignty, that should always be a red flag for what is actually racism. It's like saying, "I'm not racist, but... " You know something is actually underneath there, the Civil War is about...</p>
                        <p>22:23 Peter: Something atrocious is about to happen.</p>
                        <p>22:25 Rhiannon: Right, exactly.</p>
                        <p>22:28 Peter: So the court starts to talk about how back in 1965, the Voting Rights Act formula targeted jurisdictions where there was a history of discrimination and did so by finding jurisdictions that used "tests and devices for voter registration" and also were at least 12 points below the national average for voter suppression. And the court's sort of setting itself up here to say that these reasons no longer apply, those jurisdictions no longer do this, but one thing to keep in mind, the 15th Amendment, which allows the federal government to regulate the states to prevent voter discrimination, is extremely broad. It empowers Congress to regulate it. It uses broad language. The Conservatives will do what they always do here, when the Constitution provides a right to the federal government or anyone that they don't like, act like it's very narrow and limited, rather than providing the sort of flexibility that is almost certainly required to actually protect that right. And then the court starts to talk about the progress we've made in the last 50 years on the race issue.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>23:32 Peter: And they're like... Yeah, it's actually fucking great, "Voter turnout and registration rates in covered jurisdictions now approach parity blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels. Direct quotes from Chief Justice John Roberts. Note how every single one contains some sort of hedge. "Registration rates approach parity."</p>
                        <p>23:58 Michael: They don't quite reach parity but they're almost there.</p>
                        <p>24:01 Peter: Oh my god, they're getting so fair. [chuckle] "Discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare," and then the last one is the best, "Minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels," unprecedented. So just to put this in perspective, the house at the time of Shelby was 10% Black, and of course, nationwide, 13%. Now, it's actually very near parity right now. There are two Black senators, I don't know if you're doing that math. [laughter] Nationwide, about 9% of state legislators are Black, Hispanics are 17% of the nation-wide population. There are four Hispanic senators, again, I'll give you some time to just bust out your calculators here. And the house is about 10% Hispanic, but he's right. It is unprecedented. It's always been worse. Great point, Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
                        <p>25:00 Rhiannon: Yeah, saying that this is unprecedented levels is an observation that one is more than zero.</p>
                        <p>25:06 Peter: Right, right. So we disagree [chuckle] with the court's [laughter] determination here. Almost certainly one of the most egregious Supreme Court decisions of the past decade, and I think maybe the first point that we should make is on the question of, Is there still racial discrimination [laughter] in voting? Not only has the federal government had to decline a large number of proposed of voting law changes under the Voting Rights Act because they were too racist, but attempts to dilute minority voting power have evolved. It used to be like, "Well, what if we just asked if your grandfather was a free man, and if he was, you could vote." Now, it's a lot more elaborate. Gerrymandering techniques are designed to distract from the goal and inevitable outcome, which is that they will disenfranchise minority voters, and the dissent in this case. Ruth Bader Ginsburg writes a pretty good one, and this dissent made her famous. This is where the Notorious RBG thing started. It's a good dissent. It's not... We'll discuss a little bit later why I don't think it's an outstanding dissent or anything. One big problem with it is that she doesn't retire soon as after as she...</p>
                        <p>26:25 Michael: As she hands this in. Yeah. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:28 Peter: But again, we'll get to that, but yeah, this made her famous and just poisoned the brain of a bunch of American Constitution Society law students across the country who now have fucking mugs with her face on it and shit, but again, it's pretty good.</p>
                        <p>26:47 Rhiannon: Yeah, like YAS Queen Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p>
                        <p>26:50 Peter: Yeah, very weird for someone who is a strong breeze from just disintegrating.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>27:00 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think one of the powerful parts of this dissent is that she's talking some really specific shit about Alabama and the history there. She notes that it had more voting discrimination lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act than any state besides Mississippi. She points out that twice between the 1982 and 2006 re-authorizations, the Supreme Court itself handled two cases about purposeful voting discrimination in Alabama. So she's saying, "No, you guys aren't better, you guys keep fucking up... "</p>
                        <p>27:32 Peter: That's a great part of the dissent because it calls them out in a targeted manner, it's like, "This is, for these purposes at least, a trash state. You guys are doing this fucking worse than anyone."</p>
                        <p>27:43 Michael: How can this formula be unconstitutional to everyone when it's so obviously constitutional to this piece of garbage state that can not help itself but try to suppress the Black vote?</p>
                        <p>27:55 Peter: Yeah, and now, the next portion of this, in 2010, there is an FBI investigation that uncovered recordings of discussions between Alabama State senators, now brace yourselves here, these state senators... Again, 2010, were referring to Blacks in the state as aborigines, and they were opposing a referendum because they thought that having the referendum would lead to increased Black turnout, saying that if it were on the ballot, "Every Black, every illiterate would be bussed to the poles on HUD financed buses."</p>
                        <p>28:35 Michael: HUD being the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
                        <p>28:38 Peter: Housing and Urban Development.</p>
                        <p>28:40 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:41 Peter: That's... Look, I'm not a professor of racism. [laughter] But that reads as pretty fucking racist to me. That reads as someone who should not be holding any power, perhaps, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg quotes it directly, and the majority opinion does not discuss it interestingly enough.</p>
                        <p>29:03 Michael: Yeah, it's just... This is past us.</p>
                        <p>29:05 Peter: Sure, sure. Some state senators in Alabama refer to Blacks as aborigines. If you surveyed state senators across the state, yes, a small percentage of them would refer to Blacks as being equivalent to illiterates, of course, but let's talk about the real facts here.</p>
                        <p>29:24 Michael: We said they're rare, not non-existent.</p>
                        <p>29:26 Peter: I'm gonna commit suicide on this podcast, alright.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>29:32 Michael: I wanna talk really quick, some numbers that Ginsburg's dissent has, that I think are interesting, that go to how much progress has or has not been made that, again, the majority opinion doesn't really deal with. And so she talks about, look, under pre-clearance in between 1982 and 2006, 25 years, the DOJ had to reject 700 different attempted voter law changes because they were discriminatory. There were, on top of that, 100 successful lawsuits after the fact that the laws were found to be discriminatory. And on top of that, there were 800 instances where the DOJ didn't outright reject, but required modifications of a law to reduce racial discrimination, which if you add it up, comes out to 1600 instances over 25 years, which averages out to one every six days for 25 years straight, the DOJ was dealing with racial discrimination in voting laws just in these districts, not in the country, just in these districts, once a week.</p>
                        <p>30:43 Peter: Yeah. Alright. I wanna talk about one line in this opinion, one of the weirdest parts in the majority opinion, and it's about the fact that this is a facial challenge to the statute, and a facial challenge means that you're saying that the statute is on its face, unconstitutional, meaning that no application of it could ever be constitutional. And the distinction there is, it could be an as applied challenge, is what it's called, and that just means that in this particular application, this law is unconstitutional, they can't apply it like that. A facial challenge is this law can never be constitutional, which by the way, cannot conceivably be correct, because Roberts has effectively conceded that, initially, the law in the '60s and '70s was constitutional. So the facial challenge should, by its nature, fail. Roberts misses this point, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and...</p>
                        <p>31:38 Michael: Introduction to Con Law.</p>
                        <p>31:40 Peter: Yeah, and he refers to... He talks about this argument, and he's addressing Ginsburg's dissent where she talks about Shelby County's shitty history, and he says, "Well, it doesn't matter if Shelby County itself has had racial discrimination problems, because they're challenging the whole formula, not just the application to Shelby County." And he gives this analogy, this is a quote, "But that is like saying that a driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all red heads cannot complain about that policy if it turns out the license has expired."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:14 Peter: No. Dude. No, that's not a good analogy, okay? Here's an actually analogous situation that I just threw together last night when I was thinking about analogies here. Cops are checking on guys with a long history of domestic violence, and when they check in on serial wife beater Steve, he happens to be hitting his wife at the time, and when he's caught, he's like, "Well yeah, but how could you have known that I was gonna be hitting my wife at the time?" And the cop's like, "Well, because you're doing it all the time, Steve, because you've been hitting your wife for 50 years, just non-stop, it's unbelievable how much you hit your wife and how you refuse to stop doing it, no matter how many times we tell you, Steve, you're an awful person." Okay? That's my analogy for Shelby County, Alabama. Shelby County, Alabama is a county that did so much fucking racism that the federal government had to babysit them, and then they still tried to do more racism, the babysitter constantly caught them, and then they were like, "Isn't this babysitter illegal?" And the court's like, "Yeah, yeah it is, yeah."</p>
                        <p>33:16 Rhiannon: Yeah, and the premise of the fucking analogy. How out of touch is it for a Supreme Court Justice to be giving a lecture, an analogy about cops pre-textually stopping people, like, are you fucking kidding me? You guys authorized that.</p>
                        <p>33:34 Michael: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>33:35 Peter: And also he uses red heads in... We're talking about pretextual stops fucking next episode. So... Anyway, point number two. [laughter] If you recall, point number one was racial discrimination still exists. Point number two, the entire premise of the majority opinion is that this formula that determines which jurisdictions are covered and subject to federal pre-clearance is outdated, but it was revisited and approved by Congress in 2006, and we've touched on this. But in 2006, Congress held hearings for several months. There were witnesses, investigative reports, 15,000 pages of Congressional record. And Congress concluded that while more explicit types of voter discrimination had largely been eliminated, more subtle discrimination still existed, and it was in fact pervasive in the covered jurisdictions, and that subtle discrimination justified the continuation of the Voting Rights Act as it stood. It passed 98-0. There was a study of lawsuits for voting discrimination spanning 1982 to 2002, and it found that discriminatory practices were still, in 2002, focused in the jurisdictions identified by the formula. And this is important because on one hand, you have the opinion of John Roberts, and on the other hand, you have a literal fucking study of voter discrimination.</p>
                        <p>35:02 Rhiannon: Right, over 20 years.</p>
                        <p>35:03 Peter: Over 20 years. So I wanna talk about what I think is maybe the most significant point made by the dissent and the most significant point that cuts against the majority opinion, which is that the reason that openly discriminatory practices are no longer prevalent in these jurisdictions to the extent they used to be, is because of the Voting Rights Act. So striking down the Voting Rights Act on the basis that they have gone away is sort of missing the point, and Ginsburg makes the very astute and sharp analogy that this is throwing away an umbrella in a rainstorm because you're not getting wet. And I think that single line might be why she got famous. Everyone's like...</p>
                        <p>35:43 Michael: It's a fucking great line.</p>
                        <p>35:44 Peter: It's a great line.</p>
                        <p>35:45 Michael: That's good.</p>
                        <p>35:45 Peter: Yeah it's good shit.</p>
                        <p>35:46 Rhiannon: Yeah, and as opposed to Justice Robert's shitty analogy about redheads, like, "Okay, this is how you do an analogy, bitch," so...</p>
                        <p>35:52 Peter: Absolutely. It's a powerful analogy. It's dead-on. I think the only real thing missing from this dissent, and the only thing, for that matter, if we go back a couple of episodes, missing from Justice Steven's dissent in Citizens United, which is another really comprehensive, often brilliant dissent, is that it doesn't question the motives of the Conservative majority. And this is something that the Liberal justices never do, so a point that's important to interject here is in 2009, there was another case similar to this in origin. And Roberts did sort of the first step of the Roberts two-step, as we're calling it, copyright, registered trademark, where he set up his reasoning here.</p>
                        <p>36:39 Rhiannon: Yeah, and one thing that Roberts gets right in this majority opinion in Shelby is that he points out that two of the dissenters this time, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, they joined the majority in that 2009 case. And so, he basically calls them hypocritical for agreeing with the prior logic, but not on the natural follow-through, not on step two of the Roberts two-step, and to be honest, he's right. The Liberal justices, they should have seen what he was doing, but they waffled and they were kind of thrown off by the fact that they always, always read the Conservatives on the court as acting in good faith, and that allows them to just continue to be dunked on. So Ginsburg, in dissent, is always gonna say like, "This allows racism," right? But not like, "This actual fucking case in this opinion is racist."</p>
                        <p>37:34 Peter: Yes, the Liberals have continuously allowed themselves to be baited by the reasoning of Conservatives on the assumption that the Conservatives are just acting in good faith and doing what they believe is best, and watched it just get thrown back in their faces a few years later.</p>
                        <p>37:50 Michael: Right, and I don't wanna say that it's not hard because, obviously, a lot of the brightest minds in the legal profession work on these opinions, but the reason why Stevens and Ginsburg and Breyer and all of them can put together good dissents is because they are actually trying to argue in good faith from precedent and from logic and from the facts. And they're taking aim at arguments that aren't put together that way. They're taking aim at arguments that start with inclusion and work backwards, and so of course there are holes in the logic and of course they're stretching precedent. It's easy to find those things and point them out because they're full of shit.</p>
                        <p>38:34 Peter: Absolutely. So Scalia's dissent in Lawrence v. Texas, 2003 case that legalized sodomy, famously venomous, like many of his dissents frankly, specifically says that he believes that the majority has sort of come under the influence of the "homosexual agenda."</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>38:53 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>38:54 Peter: Actual term used by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, directly saying... He's putting it in an incredibly offensive way, but what, if you boil it down, he's saying, "You're being persuaded by cultural forces. These are not your legal opinions. This is the culture impacting you." And that is directly questioning their motivations and calling them political, right?</p>
                        <p>39:17 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>39:17 Peter: And the Liberals never fucking do this, even though the Conservatives have been marching numerous Kleger political agendas right up their fucking ass for 25 years.</p>
                        <p>39:29 Michael: I think this is a good case to point this out. I think this is literally the worst case of the Roberts' court in a lot of ways, but this is our third case on elections, right? We've done Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and now this. And I think a defining feature of democracy is free and fair elections. I think that's fair to say.</p>
                        <p>39:48 Peter: Okay. Interesting opinion.</p>
                        <p>39:51 Michael: And so, we are sitting here describing the systematic disembowelment of our democracy, like surgical murder of our democracy piece by piece by the Conservatives on the court, and the Liberals don't have the balls to even point it out. Instead they're like, "Well, if you break this down into formal logic, you've clearly... There's proof."</p>
                        <p>40:13 Peter: Well, this doesn't seem very logical at all, John Roberts!</p>
                        <p>40:15 Rhiannon: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>40:16 Michael: "Yes, I found the key error." [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>40:20 Rhiannon: It's such a clear example of how the Conservatives, again, weaponize impartiality and how it works on the Liberals and so it makes Liberals scared to do...</p>
                        <p>40:29 Peter: That's right, it's targeting the Liberals.</p>
                        <p>40:31 Rhiannon: Right, exactly, and it makes Liberals scared to dish it right back.</p>
                        <p>40:34 Michael: And this makes them complicit in Roberts' big project, we said his project is to preserve the optics of the court as a legitimate apolitical institution while it's engaging in overtly political ends and the Liberals fear of calling that out contributes to that.</p>
                        <p>40:55 Peter: Yes, while on the other hand the Conservative justices, not just recently, but in the over the past 40 years have been saying explicitly that the Liberals are manufacturing law and applying it in constitutional cases. There is a huge, huge distance between the way that the Liberals and Conservatives on the court approach the other side's arguments and conceive of the other side's arguments.</p>
                        <p>41:25 Michael: It's worth noting that this case, the court never really states the basis for their holding, they talk about equal sovereignty and so that's a phrase they throw around but they don't articulate a standard review for lower courts to use when applying the principles of equal sovereignty, let alone apply such a standard themselves. Yeah, sure, broadly speaking, there have to be some limits on Congress' power to legislate under the 14th and 15th Amendments but you don't get from there, from, "There are some limits," to, "This is unconstitutional," that's like a big jump and he never tries at once to explain...</p>
                        <p>42:07 Peter: Right, you have to tie it in.</p>
                        <p>42:08 Michael: From A to B how they got there.</p>
                        <p>42:09 Peter: And they skip over the standard that would usually be applied, which is congruence and proportionality, which is how you would usually figure out whether Congress is exceeding its rights under the Constitution, yeah, you can control F that shit in this opinion and you won't find it once.</p>
                        <p>42:26 Michael: Yeah, it's not like this is brand new. The court has tackled the VRA in specific and how to review it before. Like this is settled law how to handle this and they just shrug their shoulders because, look, the states don't like being called racist and it's not very nice. And so in the process of doing this they've nullified the portion of the VRA that identifies problematic jurisdictions entirely and they make no effort to determine whether it might still apply to some jurisdictions but not others, which is a pretty typical way that courts handle constitutional challenges, they call it severability, whether or not the unconstitutional portion is severable. One of the reasons they don't do it here is because clearly Shelby County is not severable. [chuckle] Which would be...</p>
                        <p>43:21 Peter: They're one of the bad ones.</p>
                        <p>43:23 Michael: Throw a wrench in their plans, yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:25 Peter: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:25 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>43:26 Peter: But no, but they could have said, "Look, we see enough evidence for counties and states X, Y and Z but not counties and states A, B, C," but they don't even bother because that's not the point.</p>
                        <p>43:40 Michael: Right, and at one point they say something like... Oh, it's so fucking ballsy too 'cause they say something like, "Well, look, it's not the court's prerogative, we don't wanna get in that role." But it's like, yes, it's not your fucking prerogative so why are the stomping on Congress here? That's literally not your prerogative but that's what you're doing, you're just saying, "No, you're wrong, Congress."</p>
                        <p>44:00 Rhiannon: I was just gonna say, I think the lack of a standard of review is really significant here particularly in the context of what Chief Justice John Roberts wants his legacy to be, he says that he is a formula person, he says that it's just about being an umpire, you just call balls and strikes. It implies that you use these legal formulas, you apply them to the facts of the case and an objective answer comes out. Okay, well, in this case he doesn't even fucking use the formula, he doesn't use the standard that's already there and it's obvious, it brings us to the central premise of the podcast of the project, which is they are doing this shit on purpose.</p>
                        <p>44:37 Michael: If Liberals tried to pull this sort of flighty bullshit every single Conservative would write a dissent.</p>
                        <p>44:45 Peter: Yeah, the real issue here, the real reason we're talking about this is because the court is not interested, even a small amount, in whether Congress is exceeding its power under the 15th Amendment. They barely even talk about it in the opinion as such, what they are aware of is that protections for minority voters hurt Republicans and that is bad for Republicans and they are Republicans so they would like to get rid of those protections. It genuinely doesn't go further than that and if you try to ascribe to them some sort of higher purpose, you will inevitably get lost because it doesn't really make sense unless you understand what they're doing here, that they are being pragmatic, that they are helping their political party, the reason the majority opinion isn't interested in investigating the nuance of which jurisdictions should still be covered is because they have identified the opportunity to allow Republicans across the country to acquire more power by disenfranchising minorities and they are seizing that opportunity, period, flat out, straight up. That's it.</p>
                        <p>45:52 Rhiannon: Go off King.</p>
                        <p>45:53 Peter: Thank you. [laughter] Do you say thank you to go off king?</p>
                        <p>46:01 Michael: I don't wanna talk too much out of my ass here but it's something I was thinking about really...</p>
                        <p>46:04 Rhiannon: No, please continue to do that.</p>
                        <p>46:06 Michael: Yeah, reading...</p>
                        <p>46:07 Peter: Go off King?</p>
                        <p>46:08 Michael: Alright, I'm gonna go off.</p>
                        <p>46:10 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>46:11 Michael: Alright, reading the dissent, Ginsburg talks about all these examples of instances the Voting Rights Act has stepped in to stop discrimination and in everyone, the discrimination is in response to some sort of minority activism, Blacks are coming out in record numbers so we need to literally cancel the election, which is one thing that happened in [chuckle] Mississippi, they were like, "Fuck, we're just not gonna have an election this year. Forget that." And they're all like that, it's like, oh, black mobilization leads to the reaction, right? And in 2006, you kinda wonder well is it just optics that Conservatives are jumping on board and this is passing 98-0 in the Senate and something insane like 390-30 in the House or did something change? And maybe it's that in 2008 something did change. Maybe there was massive Black voter mobilization at the federal level.</p>
                        <p>47:09 Peter: I don't know why.</p>
                        <p>47:11 Michael: And a Black president was elected maybe and he won states that Democrats traditionally hadn't, like Virginia and North Carolina and started reaching into the south.</p>
                        <p>47:19 Peter: Okay, I see that theory.</p>
                        <p>47:21 Michael: I don't know. I'm just speculating, but it's... Maybe what we're seeing here is precisely the sort of reaction that the voting rights is supposed to come back.</p>
                        <p>47:32 Peter: I think that might be right. But again, wild speculation.</p>
                        <p>47:35 Michael: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Who knows really?</p>
                        <p>47:38 Peter: So we've been talking a lot about John Roberts, but maybe we should talk about our boy, Antonin Scalia, one of only two POC in the Supreme Court at the time. [laughter] Yeah, so at oral argument, Scalia refers to this as a "racial entitlement." And I have to ask, what is the entitlement here? No single person can get anything out of this legislation beyond the right to vote, period. That is the absolute most any individual can get out of the Voting Rights Act. So how can that be construed even a little bit as a racial entitlement? That is a deep gaze, I think, into the absolutely diseased fucking mind of Antonin Scalia who is just absolutely one of the most unbelievable pieces of shit in Supreme Court history, which is saying something and whose burial patch has no grass growing atop it.</p>
                        <p>48:37 Rhiannon: That's it. That's all there is to say.</p>
                        <p>48:40 Peter: So we should talk about how this has panned out, and the good news is there's been no ill effects. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>48:48 Rhiannon: Sorry, I couldn't even make it.</p>
                        <p>48:50 Peter: The Liberal justices and many commentators at the time made a very simple, I think an obvious prediction, which is, this is gonna be a fucking disaster. As soon as federal oversight is pulled away, the racist jurisdictions are gonna immediately start implementing racist voting laws, and the majority opinion, no joke, does not even talk about what might happen here. And since then, what we've seen is relentless systematic disenfranchisement of voters within 24 hours of Shelby County dropping, Texas announces a new voter ID law.</p>
                        <p>49:21 Michael: Immediately.</p>
                        <p>49:22 Peter: Within 24 hours, which by the way, means that they knew that this was gonna come down 5-4 and they had this written. They were ready to go.</p>
                        <p>49:28 Michael: They had it fucking locked and loaded.</p>
                        <p>49:30 Peter: Mississippi and Alabama both almost immediately began to enforce voter ID laws that had previously been barred under the Voting Rights Act.</p>
                        <p>49:37 Rhiannon: Yeah, the Brennan Center for Justice issued a report in 2018 that found that this court decision alone was responsible for the purge of 2 million voters from the polls just up until 2016.</p>
                        <p>49:49 Peter: It's two and a half years.</p>
                        <p>49:51 Rhiannon: Which is fucking wild. We're talking about millions of people. And then there's a 2019 study that actually showed that pre-clearance led to an increase of minority turnout of 17 percentage points in elections of covered jurisdictions.</p>
                        <p>50:09 Michael: Yeah, and the court has sanctioned racially motivated policies elsewhere too, an aggressive voter purge policy in Ohio that removes you from the voter rolls if you fail to vote, statewide gerrymandering, and we'll be covering these cases, but they have just been on a fucking tear.</p>
                        <p>50:26 Peter: Yeah, it's war and it's outright voter purging, we're talking millions of people a year.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>

                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: Well, I get to say that this is case number 11345, Fisher against the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:07 Leon Neyfakh: Hey, everyone. It's Leon Neyfakh, co-creator of Fiasco and Slow Burn. On this week's episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about Fisher v. University of Texas, a supreme court decision that encapsulates the modern debate on affirmative action.</p>
                        <p>00:23 [Archival]: Abigail Fisher was rejected for admission, even though some students with lower test scores and grades got in ahead of her.</p>
                        <p>00:30 Leon Neyfakh: Fisher helped transform the equal protection clause, from a tool that shielded the rights of freed slaves into a weapon used to undermine civil rights.</p>
                        <p>00:39 Speaker 4: I hope the court rules that a student's race and ethnicity should not be considered when applying to the university.</p>
                        <p>00:44 Speaker 5: She's lost at three levels of the justice system, but it appears likely the Supremes will take her side and cripple affirmative action.</p>
                        <p>00:50 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>00:58 Peter: Welcome to 5-4 podcast, where we dissect and analyze the terrible Supreme Court decisions whose collective weight have slowly crushed the American soul like stones laid atop an accused which [laughter] I am Peter, Twitter is The Law Boy. I am here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:17 Michael: Hey, Peter.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Peter: And from Austin, Texas, Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:21 Rhiannon: Hi.</p>
                        <p>01:22 Peter: And together, we are America's only sexually-active lawyers [laughter] I think that's right. No, I think that's right. And we are covering Fisher v. Texas, affirmative action case from 2013, and then also, a little bit later, in 2016, that we thought was important to cover primarily because it highlights how Conservatives on the court have turned the Equal Protection Clause, which was meant to protect freed slaves, essentially, into a bludgeon against legislative attempts to promote diversity and correct for historical discrimination. And also because it's sort of the story of a very, very mediocre White girl who decided to bring her failure to get into the University of Texas to court. And this is the sort of mediocrity that you don't see that often, and I wanna dive in. Rhi, tell us a little bit about Abigail Fisher.</p>
                        <p>02:29 Rhiannon: Enter, yes, Abigail Fisher into our lives. In 2013, she crashes on the scene and she is... You know how, in Scarface, there's a scene where...</p>
                        <p>02:43 Peter: Already with you.</p>
                        <p>02:44 Rhiannon: Michelle Pfeiffer's character, she's like, "You know, Tony, you're just like the rest of them." And she calls him a racial epithet. And he's like, "Who are you calling a... " Whatever, "You White piece of bread." Abigail Fisher is a White piece of bread. Okay? [laughter] So, what's going on in Abigail Fisher's life in 2013 is that she's applying in the University of Texas, like Peter said.</p>
                        <p>03:09 Peter: Well, it's not 2013, right? It's before this. When did she apply?</p>
                        <p>03:12 Rhiannon: Well, yeah. Okay. Yes, thank you. She's applied before 2013.</p>
                        <p>03:17 Peter: Just making sure we're all on the same page.</p>
                        <p>03:21 Rhiannon: She's applied before 2013. And in Texas, there's a law that they passed back in the 90s that required the University of Texas to admit all high school seniors who ranked in the top 10% of their high school classes. Now, when that law goes into effect, the University of Texas looks at, then, the resulting racial, ethnic and cultural background of the undergraduate population at the school, and compare it to the rest of the state. Big surprise, it turns out everybody who's admitted, the vast majority of people are White. So, the University of Texas looks at its policies, and they're like, "What can we do? We need to be admitting a more diverse student population, something that looks a little bit more reflective of the state population, as a whole." And so, they decide to modify their admissions policy so that, for the rest of in-state admission allotments, so we're talking about 8% of in-state admitted students, the university will consider race as one of the factors in admission.</p>
                        <p>04:27 Michael: In addition to things like socioeconomic status and...</p>
                        <p>04:31 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>04:31 Peter: And all the usuals, grades, and all that stuff.</p>
                        <p>04:33 Michael: Activities and...</p>
                        <p>04:34 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>04:35 Rhiannon: Yeah, or like if your parents went to the school, or if your parents are donors to the school, those things might be considered too.</p>
                        <p>04:40 Michael: No way.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>04:44 Rhiannon: So, Abigail Fisher gets denied admission to UT under this system. I don't know how important this is, but she had a 3.59 GPA, she had an 1180 SAT score. She's alright. Alright? She's not a baby genius...</p>
                        <p>05:00 Peter: Yeah, that's like... It's middling, but it's also... It's way below... UT is a strong school, and it's way below... I think it's well below their 25th percentile in both categories.</p>
                        <p>05:11 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:11 Peter: Is that right?</p>
                        <p>05:11 Michael: Yeah, they had 30,000 applicants that year, and 10,000 of the 12,000 spots went to the top 10% people, so you're talking 20,000 applicants for 2000 spots. It's gonna be very competitive. That's Ivy League-level selectivity.</p>
                        <p>05:28 Peter: Right. And so, also important to note though, the day she gets rejected, she calls a lawyer.</p>
                        <p>05:35 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>05:36 Peter: She calls up her dad's friend, who just so happens to be extremely into the idea of suing for affirmative action and has been looking for a case. She's like, "Hey, weren't you looking to sue about affirmative action? Well, just got rejected and I think it might be because I'm White."</p>
                        <p>05:53 Michael: You won't believe this, there are Black and Hispanic people in my school who got into UT and I did not.</p>
                        <p>06:01 Rhiannon: That's exactly right.</p>
                        <p>06:02 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>06:03 Rhiannon: That's exactly right. And there's a point to be made here, I think, that her family is sort of... Has the access and is rich enough to have a legal team on speed dial, but they clearly weren't rich enough to just bribe her into UT...</p>
                        <p>06:21 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>06:21 Rhiannon: Like real rich families.</p>
                        <p>06:22 Peter: You can buy a lawn... I don't know what it takes at UT...</p>
                        <p>06:24 Michael: Right, I was gonna say a plaque and a bench.</p>
                        <p>06:28 Peter: But everything at school has some family name on it.</p>
                        <p>06:30 Michael: And I just wanna further contextualize her scores, because if you've got a lawyer on speed dial, there is no doubt she had SAT prep, and shit like that.</p>
                        <p>06:39 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>06:40 Rhiannon: Yes.</p>
                        <p>06:40 Michael: And that makes the 1180, which is okay, but not that impressive, seem...</p>
                        <p>06:45 Peter: I'll say it, soft. If that's your after deep prep score, I'm not... Look, it might just be your score, but you have to live with that. That's what your life is gonna be like. You're not gonna sue your way to a 1400.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:04 Michael: You shouldn't be eager to put that shit in court documents that can be recorded...</p>
                        <p>07:07 Peter: As soon as they were like, "We're gonna put the 1180 in the court docs," I'd be like, "Actually, let's just... I'm just gonna go to LSU... "</p>
                        <p>07:14 Rhiannon: Right, never mind.</p>
                        <p>07:16 Peter: Which is where she goes.</p>
                        <p>07:17 Rhiannon: So, yeah, she calls up the lawyers, and so that means that Edward Bloom is on the scene. Mr. Bloom is the founder of the Project on Fair Representation, which is a... It's a non-profit organization, and they basically do pro bono work, looking for and representing plaintiffs to the Supreme Court so that they can shit on the 14th Amendment.</p>
                        <p>07:38 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>07:38 Rhiannon: This is also... Their project on fair representation there, the people who also take Shelby, a voting rights case to the Supreme Court, that same term.</p>
                        <p>07:47 Peter: It really is a White people's rights organization. Obviously, they don't frame it like that, but the Shelby County voting rights case is a completely different area of the law, and it's very weird to be deep on the White person side of both of those as one organization.</p>
                        <p>08:04 Michael: Yeah, it's almost like they are very concerned with White people's status being supreme in our society.</p>
                        <p>08:14 Peter: It's the kind of a non-profit you have if your SAT scores are an 1180, and you're like, "How do I stay on top of this?"</p>
                        <p>08:21 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:24 Rhiannon: So, these guys at the Project on Fair Representation, they're making the argument that the consideration of race in admissions policies, that's a violation of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. So UT's admission policies that take race into account, that's treating people of different races in a discriminatory way, and as part of this, they say publicly, for months, you can listen to her say this in interviews, that people with lower test scores and lower GPAs than Abby are admitted, and the only difference between those people and Abigail Fisher is that those students are people of color. I think it's really important to highlight that that's just... It's fucking false. It's not right.</p>
                        <p>09:07 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:07 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>09:08 Rhiannon: They're completely ignoring facts on the ground, which are that there were 47, less than 50, 47 students with lower test scores and grades then Abigail Fisher who were admitted that year to UT, and of those 47, 42 of them are fucking White people.</p>
                        <p>09:25 Michael: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>09:27 Peter: And worth noting... So she's made public statements saying, "I had classmates who were getting in, who didn't have the... Who didn't have grades as strong as I did." It's like, "You had classmates? Some of those 47 people were in your classes and you knew who they were?"</p>
                        <p>09:41 Michael: Including the five minorities?</p>
                        <p>09:43 Peter: What happened is she's...</p>
                        <p>09:44 Rhiannon: And you knew their grades?</p>
                        <p>09:45 Michael: Right?</p>
                        <p>09:46 Peter: Right. What happened is she was told her whole life by her, undoubtedly, kinda weird family, you can sort of read between the lines here, that this is like an affront to White people, and it's unfair to you, Abby, and we're gonna take a stand. And so, she gets the rejection. She's like, "You know who I think did this to me? Is maybe that kid, Frank, in my Calc class, a Black kid I know. I think it was him."</p>
                        <p>10:10 Rhiannon: No, she wasn't in Calc. She didn't make it to Calc.</p>
                        <p>10:11 Michael: That's an "Ouch."</p>
                        <p>10:12 Peter: What's before Calc?</p>
                        <p>10:14 Michael: Pre-Calc.</p>
                        <p>10:15 Rhiannon: Pre-Calc.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:19 Michael: She was doing trigonometry, right?</p>
                        <p>10:21 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:22 Peter: Which one is shapes? [laughter] That's where I topped out, by the way, mathematically, the shapes one.</p>
                        <p>10:29 Michael: I just wanna say, I think, in her inner monologue, she wasn't referring to him as, "That Black kid Frank."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:35 Michael: I think she may have used stronger language in her head, that's my guess.</p>
                        <p>10:44 Peter: I don't wanna get too harsh on Abby Fisher just because she's terrible at school, and...</p>
                        <p>10:48 Michael: I do.</p>
                        <p>10:50 Peter: So, this has led to some harassment of Abby. We should be honest, right? When this case was ultimately settled, the #StayMadAbby trended, right? Shortly after that, in 2016, someone who wasn't a fan of hers flipped her onto her back in public and she was, sort of like similar to a turtle, unable to right herself for several hours until assistance arrived. I don't wanna endorse that. In 2017, someone kind of quietly snuck a treadmill under her and she just walked in place for nearly a day until someone notified her about what was going on. So, again, I just... I don't wanna encourage that sort of behavior, that's not what we're here for.</p>
                        <p>11:31 Rhiannon: Definitely not.</p>
                        <p>11:32 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>11:32 Peter: And I wish her the best. I wish her and White people everywhere the best, may you throw off your chains and rise to meet your oppressors.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>11:45 Peter: Abby's lawsuit makes its way up, right? And the appellate court basically gives Texas's policy, the consideration of race, a thumbs up, saying, essentially, "Yeah, this seems to be fine." They don't do a thorough analysis, the analysis required by the President, the Supreme Court, and as a result, this our first non-5-4 case, right? This is a 7-1 case, the 2013 case. And that's because it's sort of a formalistically simple question, which is, did the court below consider the question properly? The Supreme Court says, "No, no, no, you didn't analyze the policy correctly." And they sent it back down to apply the proper framework. So the Equal Protection Clause says that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. And if a law is challenged for being discriminatory against a group of people, the court will default to evaluating it under a test that's called rational basis review. And it just means that if the government has any rational basis for the law, then it's okay. And historically, this has been like a very low bar that's easy to get past.</p>
                        <p>12:54 Michael: Very, very easy. And it makes sense, right? The government makes distinctions between groups of citizens all the time, it's totally normal, like wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than working people and poor people, and that's normal. And it's not an Equal Protection violation yet, so... [chuckle] I don't wanna give the Conservatives in the court any ideas.</p>
                        <p>13:16 Peter: If Neil Gorsuch is listening to this, we're fucked.</p>
                        <p>13:17 Michael: Yeah, but... So the court gives Congress the benefit of the doubt, that they're acting in good faith, and as long as they can point to a legitimate purpose of the law, and show that it's doing generally what it's supposed to be doing, the court says it's constitutional.</p>
                        <p>13:32 Peter: So to give some color, give ive an example, Williamson v. Lee optical was a 1955 case where someone challenged an Oklahoma law that required individuals seeking eye glasses to get a prescription for those eye glasses. And the argument was that this discriminated against unlicensed opticians...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>13:52 Peter: Okay. It's a different time, and the law was upheld under a rational basis review because there's a legitimate government interest in promoting people seeing stuff, and the law was rationally related to that interest, right? So that's sort of the outer boundaries of it, but it's also worth noting that this very low standard has been applied to discrimination against LGBT people, which is essentially a statement that they are not a particularly discriminated against group, historically, which we'll get into, I think maybe just in...</p>
                        <p>14:22 Michael: There might be something to cover.</p>
                        <p>14:24 Peter: For a minute in a second. But, yeah, I think that speaks for itself.</p>
                        <p>14:28 Michael: Right. The flipside of this though is that the 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the Civil War, and if it means anything, it means that it protects historically-oppressed groups, and so the courts need something to give force to that.</p>
                        <p>14:43 Peter: Right. And so what the court does about this is if a law discriminates against historically-oppressed groups, the courts scrutinizes those laws much more intensely, meaning that the government's interest needs to be more compelling and the law needs to be more tailored to achieving that interest. So one step up from rational basis review is what's called intermediate scrutiny, that's just a little higher, and that's the standard used when the court is evaluating discrimination based on gender or, for some reason, legitimacy of birth.</p>
                        <p>15:13 Michael: Women and bastards.</p>
                        <p>15:14 Peter: No idea why they think that bastards are historically discriminated against to the same extent as women, but my only real guess is that this is sort of an old case. And back in the day, this was the worst thing you could say to someone, like if someone walked up to you on the street and was like, "Your mother was an impure woman," you had to fight them to the death. That was how it was until 1985.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:36 Michael: And it's not even that old a case though. It's like '40s, right? Anyway, as a practical matter, intermediate scrutiny, when a court applies that test, it's much more likely to find a law unconstitutional.</p>
                        <p>15:50 Peter: Right. And then if a law targets some of the categories that the court considers to be the subject of the most historical discrimination, which... It's defined as race, national origin and religion, those are subject to the most intense review, which is called strict scrutiny.</p>
                        <p>16:07 Michael: And so laws almost never pass this test, it's very rare, and they're almost always found to be unconstitutional when a court applies it. And in this case here, the court says, "Well, look, the school's admission criteria explicitly considers race, so that's discriminating on race, strict scrutiny is the proper test." And so when the court kicks this back down to a lower court, saying, "You gotta apply strict scrutiny," that's why everybody just assumed affirmative action was dead.</p>
                        <p>16:40 Rhiannon: And is the first articulation of strict scrutiny like this strict scrutiny in Korematsu.</p>
                        <p>16:45 Peter: Yes.</p>
                        <p>16:46 Michael: It is. The first time they articulated is in turning Japanese Americans, and that survived strict scrutiny.</p>
                        <p>16:53 Peter: Yeah, the first time this pops up is when the court was deciding that putting Japanese people in internment camps during World War II was A-okay.</p>
                        <p>17:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:01 Peter: Just to give you a sense of where they're coming from with this shit. And I think maybe the most offensive part of the whole framework is that it's based on category. So, differentiation based on a race gets the most scrutiny no matter what the race is, same with religion, which means that if you treat Whites unfavorably, it's treated the exact same way as if you treated Blacks or Hispanics unfavorably, despite the fact that the whole historic discrimination thing gets flipped on its head entirely.</p>
                        <p>17:27 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>17:27 Peter: That means that the court would scrutinize a claim of discrimination against a White Christian man more intensely than a gay woman, for example, just because one is race and religion and the other sexuality and gender, which they don't think are that important.</p>
                        <p>17:41 Michael: Right. I'm just imagining the Roberts court sitting down with General Sherman, and being like, "Look, 40 acres and a mule, that's just for Black people. [chuckle] And you know that the Constitution does not discriminate based on race, so we're gonna have to take a real close look at this."</p>
                        <p>18:00 Peter: And the result of this inability to distinguish between, say, discrimination against White people and Black people, is that the Equal Protection Clause, which popped up after slavery, specifically to protect the rights of freed slaves has become a tool to attack good faith attempts by the government to make race-based determinations to correct past inequities. So states have stopped being expressly racist against non-Whites in the way that they were in the '50s. They pass subtler laws, photo ID, gerrymandering, these things target non-Whites, and they do so on purpose, but they don't do so explicitly, and so they don't get the highest level of scrutiny, in most cases. The only laws that do openly distinguish between races are laws like affirmative action, which are openly and honestly trying to remediate those same historical wrongs. And the result is that, in a lot of ways, the Equal Protection Clause has been kind of flipped and has now been a effective mechanism for beating back liberal left attempts to combat racism.</p>
                        <p>19:00 Michael: And you see that with the history of affirmative action. This is a program that was born in the same time as desegregation was happening, right? And the idea is precisely to ameliorate inequities in education for Black Americans versus White Americans. This is a major problem, that Black Americans are segregated, they're in separate and worse schools, they're not getting into the same schools as White people or not getting into colleges at all, and the idea is, well, we need to change that, and it's about inequality and inequity, right?</p>
                        <p>19:36 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>19:36 Michael: And that gets completely sort of neutered because the idea that a program is designed to help Black people is so scary, and it's a recognized, compelling government interest that satisfies the Equal Protection Clause, but what the Supreme Court says is like, "Well, college admissions boards aren't really in position to make that judgement call, so they have to find a better different reason for wanting to have Black people in their schools."</p>
                        <p>20:06 Peter: Right, and that has become the reason that the schools are now leaning on to sort of get around that weird and bad faith reasoning, is diversity on campus, the idea that affirmative action isn't really to correct those past wrongs, diversity is good on campus, people benefit from it, and they have like... I mean, there's plenty of research to show that that's correct. It's no longer about correcting those historic wrongs. I think everyone knows that that's untrue, but that's the reason that they have been sort of reduced to by the Supreme Court over the course of the past 30 years.</p>
                        <p>20:38 Michael: Right. In 1977, the New York Times is running editorials describing affirmative action, like in the headline, as Reparations American-style, and now it's like this is really for White people, so that they get to talk to Black people and Hispanics and broaden the horizon.</p>
                        <p>20:54 Peter: Wouldn't you like to... Wouldn't you like your kid to be able to talk to a minority for a little bit before they went off to Goldman? Wouldn't that be a nice little treat for Danny?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>21:02 Rhiannon: Yeah, what I think you see over the course of the history of affirmative action in the courts and the way it's litigated is, first of all, you see the court's paternalism, that they're taking over, saying that judges are the ones to better decide what's good at a university, what's good for a public school to be doing in terms of educating the state students? And then the other thing that you see is that, like Michael said, it starts with this really robust, almost like a reparations argument, an idea about ameliorating and remedying past harms against racial minorities, but then what happens is the people with access to legal teams and access to the legal institutions, White people and rich people, mostly Conservatives, are going to litigate it over and over and over again until it's something that we see, and why I think it's important to talk about this case. Even though the affirmative action program at UT is eventually upheld, what the Fisher case shows is how sort of White-washed and neutered once you have new conservative judges, once you have new cultural swings, and Conservatives are like fuck civil rights.</p>
                        <p>22:16 Peter: Affirmative action is for sure, going down, right? I don't know that it gets raised to the Supreme Court any time super soon, but in the next decade, there's just no way it survives absent a serious shift on the court.</p>
                        <p>22:27 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>22:27 Peter: So, as we mentioned, this decision, it goes 7-1, and sorry, by the way, about doing the third episode, just deviating from the 5-4 name immediately. This is spiritually 5-4, and the reason is because of the Clarence Thomas concurrence. And in that concurrence, he basically lays out all the reasons he thinks that affirmative action should be banned under the Equal Protection Clause. And your first question might be, "Isn't Clarence Thomas Black?" He is, and I just want you to keep in mind what it must take to get a young Black man born in, what, 1950 to the point he is in this case. It is psychology stuff I don't understand at all, but it's psychology nonetheless. There's so much psychology going on in here, I can't even believe it.</p>
                        <p>23:16 Rhiannon: Clarence Thomas has seen some shit.</p>
                        <p>23:19 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>23:20 Peter: Very, very weird. He starts off his concurrence with the heart of his opinion, which is that the Equal Protection Clause is about the principle that government must treat citizens as individuals, not as members of groups. And again, this is just the soul of the Conservative argument about affirmative action and similar government policies. You look at it entirely in a vacuum, and you say, "This is making determinations based on race," which is bad, and completely dodges the real issue, which is that these policies are reactions to the fact that society itself makes unfair and inequitable determinations based on race that need to be redressed. You're waiting until society has already sorted people based on race, and then saying, "We're now blind to race."</p>
                        <p>24:02 Michael: Right, and so that's like... You know, I don't wanna get ahead of us, to the Ginsburg dissent, just one point she makes in rebuttal to that, that I think is good, which is that the top 10% program at UT is supposedly race-neutral, but the reason why it actually increased diversity from minuscule to slightly more than minuscule at the school is because the schools in Texas were so segregated that you're taking the top 10% from schools that are almost predominantly Black, or almost predominantly Hispanic, and that sort of, by default, is increasing diversity. And so the idea that these are otherwise neutral policies when society is structured in such a racial way is... It's a joke.</p>
                        <p>24:50 Peter: Right. That's one thing, and again, we shouldn't get too far into Ginsburg's point, but the sort of reduction of affirmative action to this weird diversity argument has led us to a place where every single person is lying, right? The schools are lying about what their reasoning is, the Conservatives on the court that are knocking the shit down are lying about what their reasoning is, and no one is being honest about what they're trying to do, which is like one side is trying to correct for historical wrongs and the other side is saying, "No, we don't think we need that. I think we're good." So this decision, it goes 7-1 and the court says that the circuit court below did not properly apply the strict scrutiny framework that the Supreme Court has required of race-based admissions policies. And pretty much everyone agrees that they didn't apply it correctly... Or almost everyone agrees. Ginsburg dissents, so it gets knocked down to the lower court for reconsideration.</p>
                        <p>25:40 Peter: Thomas's concurrence is saying, "Yeah, I agree with the majority. It should have been sent down to the lower court, but here are all the reasons why, when it makes its way back up here, I'm going to try to shoot down affirmative action." Thomas's basic thesis here is the same as every man at a frat party, where a 20-year-old guy is like, "Yeah, I'm color-blind." And you're like, "Hm, don't like that." I'm just... Red flags everywhere.</p>
                        <p>26:09 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:10 Peter: Clarence Thomas says that race-based considerations demean us all. I don't feel demeaned.</p>
                        <p>26:16 Michael: No.</p>
                        <p>26:16 Peter: And it's exactly the kind of shit that, when Liberals say it, the Conservatives are like, "Oh, this is very feelings-based arguing."</p>
                        <p>26:22 Michael: Right. If you said that anti-gay laws demean us all, they would fucking excoriate you. They would just kill you. Just paragraph after paragraph of what bullshit that is.</p>
                        <p>26:32 Peter: Right. All of his arguments are sort of this like gee, shucks, slippery slope argument, like, "Well, you say you wanna give Black kids the chance to get into school, but what if this gets out of control and it's just full-scale segregation again?" It's like, well, I don't think that that's a realistic possibility here, dude. I think that an affirmative action policy that gets African American admissions to 3% lower than their actual percentage of the population in Texas, or whatever the fuck, is not at risk of actually recreating segregation somehow. Like what are you even fucking talking about?</p>
                        <p>27:06 Michael: Right, and he goes in on Texas University and Ginsburg for echoing arguments of segregationists and slaveholders. And he's like, "Well, slaveholders said that this was good for Black people, and segregationists said that this furthered educational interests." And it's like, are you really not gonna interrogate, at all, what is underneath those arguments?</p>
                        <p>27:34 Peter: Right. You don't have to pretend that all of those arguments are the same, like slaveholders said it was good, you said it's good. I just can't parse this, what's happening?</p>
                        <p>27:42 Rhiannon: Right. Right. That's what's so annoying to me too about this continued Conservative argument, is it's, on its face, not strenuous, intellectual, legal reasoning, right? It's just a lie about how race works in society. And everybody knows it, so even like Justice Blackmun, who isn't on the court anymore, but he is saying the same things back in affirmative action cases from decades before, in particular, in one in Bakke, saying, quote, "I suspect that it would be impossible to arrange an affirmative action program in a racially-neutral way and have it successful. To ask that this be so is to demand the impossible." So everybody knows, right? That it's a lie. So after the Fisher 2013 case comes out, universities are concerned about how to ensure diverse student populations, and a little-known publication called the Harvard Educational Review feels compelled to basically publish this statement as...</p>
                        <p>28:42 Peter: Hold on. Wait, was that sarcastic and I should know what that is? Or is that like a really... I do not know what that is.</p>
                        <p>28:48 Rhiannon: I mean, not even that I give a fuck what institutions like Harvard have to say about this, but these are the people that, purportedly, I guess, are concerned about teaching kids, or something. And so they say...</p>
                        <p>29:00 Peter: I do not think that's what Harvard is concerned with.</p>
                        <p>29:01 Michael: Harvard's like a real estate hedge fund with...</p>
                        <p>29:04 Peter: Yeah, that's correct. What's their endowment now? It's somewhere between 30 and 40 billion.</p>
                        <p>29:09 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:09 Rhiannon: And I think a close second is the University of Texas.</p>
                        <p>29:12 Michael: That wouldn't surprise me.</p>
                        <p>29:12 Peter: Look at them go.</p>
                        <p>29:14 Rhiannon: So, anyways, the Harvard Educational Review in 2013, after Fisher comes down, they're saying, "We wonder what Fisher teaches us about the limits of race neutrality as a guiding framework for addressing racial inequality. We're deeply concerned about an emerging catch-22 that some students of color who, as a by-product of poor funding and strained resources in racially-segregated schools, have not been afforded equal educational opportunity, should be deemed unprepared for elite education by the same structures that systematically unprepared them." So it really can't be overstated how much Thomas's argument and the Conservative argument here is based on an absolute lie that everybody knows about race and diversity.</p>
                        <p>29:54 Peter: So, to circle back to... Michael, you mentioned that he makes this argument that all this stuff is the same thing that segregationists proposed. This is a quote from him, "The argument that educational benefits justify racial discrimination was advanced in support of racial segregation in the 1950s, but emphatically rejected by this court." And what he's referring to is Brown v. Board of Education. And like, yeah, dude, good argument. Same thing, right?</p>
                        <p>30:16 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:17 Peter: So what's happening is this is where the conflation of all different types of racial differentiation is weaponized by Conservatives, who can just pretend that the efforts by the states in the 1950s to keep Blacks in a functionally-separate society are actually the same as efforts by the states now to do the exact opposite thing. And it's like the epitome of the Conservative brain on race issues, generally, right? Where the only thing that ever matters is discrimination in its most literal and obvious sense. You have, like we mentioned, voter ID gerrymandering, any of the countless right-wing efforts to disenfranchise and disempower minorities that don't technically target people by their race, but A, have the impact of targeting people by their race, and B, if you dig into even a few of the records behind any of those efforts, it's extremely obvious what the motivations are, right? Those all get a shrug from Conservatives because it's not explicit.</p>
                        <p>31:13 Michael: The one thing I will say that I appreciate about Thomas's concurrence is I actually think pretty highly of Thomas as a writer, he writes very clearly and powerfully on his ideas, which are often, I find, to be totally bat-shit crazy, but he enunciates them in a very clear way. And I was reading this and it felt uncharacteristically like bullshit.</p>
                        <p>31:32 Peter: Yeah. Yeah. It feels rant-y and weird.</p>
                        <p>31:35 Michael: Yeah. There was one point towards the end, though, where I felt like the mask came off and he was just like, "Look, fucking White people, they've never done anything for Black people.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>31:46 Michael: And I don't trust them to do anything for Black people. And I'm like if that was the concurrence, in its entirety, I would be like, "Yeah, I feel that. I respect that." But there is a bunch of Conservative bullshit heaped on top of it.</p>
                        <p>31:58 Peter: Right. This is also a quote, "There is no principle distinction between the university's assertion that diversity yields educational benefits, and the segregationist's assertion that segregation yields those same benefits." [chuckle] First of all, this stuff is objectively measurable, right? You can actually figure out if this stuff benefits people, you can measure across all sorts of metrics, right? And also, the segregationist's argument was that if you ended segregation, it would cause Whites to be vindictive towards Blacks, and it's like is that really the same argument? Is that really what we're talking about here? I don't think so. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>32:32 Michael: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:33 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:33 Peter: And then he gets to the real juice of it, where it gets really interesting and weird, which is where he starts talking about how minorities themselves are hurt by affirmative action. And this is when you can start to tell that this is a very personal thing to Clarence Thomas.</p>
                        <p>32:45 Michael: He has a bit of an axe to grind. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>32:47 Peter: So he says minorities admitted to schools under affirmative action are less prepared than their peers, and will struggle in a harder school, when they would have been fine in a lesser school. And he makes the point that Blacks and Hispanics will feel bad because people will assume that they didn't earn their place, which by the way, that's the actual argument made by segregationists in Brown v. Board, because what it's saying is that White people are going to be upset and vindictive about this, and that we need to cater to them on that point. That's very similar to the segregationist argument. So, first, this is like this very weird paternalistic argument, where it's like, "Look, we need to protect minorities from these hard classes," as if they can't make this decision themselves. They can go to a lesser school if they feel like it, right? It's their choice. And also, I don't think the schools are easier. I don't wanna speak to STEM. I feel like... I'm sure Caltech is harder than, whatever, Georgia Tech. Is Georgia Tech bad?</p>
                        <p>33:37 Michael: Yeah, but Caltech is cool.</p>
                        <p>33:37 Peter: But some shitty tech like St. John's Tech, I'm sure that Caltech's harder.</p>
                        <p>33:42 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>33:42 Peter: But fucking History at Harvard is not drastically harder than History at fucking Hofstra, or whatever. And the idea that we need to protect them from fucking Social Psychology at Yale or something [chuckle], come on, fuck outta here.</p>
                        <p>33:58 Rhiannon: Right. Right. The idea that we need to protect them from social ostracization, or just feeling bad about themselves, but not protect them from what society does to relegate racial minorities, it's wild to me, how is helping the great grandchild of an enslaved person go to college, how is that a bad thing for our world?</p>
                        <p>34:22 Peter: And it goes without saying that Conservatives have absolutely zero interest. And it's not at question here, but have zero interest at all in interrogating admissions for donors, legacies, athletes, no interest in using the Equal Protection Clause to protect the poor or any other category of people. The result of that is the gaping contrast between the empty hand-wringing about unfairness about race, and then the complete disregard of it, where similar unfairness benefits all of their friends that they make at fucking awards dinners. I don't know if any... If our listeners are unfamiliar with what Supreme Court justices do in their free time, it's like they obviously don't have real jobs, and people want them to speak at places and show up at their dinners and stuff. So you just give them a fake award, where it's like, "Oh, Clarence Thomas, you just won the Constitution Society's award for judging, so if you can just pop up at this dinner and we're gonna give you $10,000 and a trophy, and you say 10 words." That's their whole life. Every weekday is just one of those things. [chuckle] And they make a bunch of friends there, and all of their friends are like, "Hey, my kid... My kid didn't get into the University of Georgia. He scored a 28 on the SATs. [chuckle] And I just... I think that Blacks did it."</p>
                        <p>35:51 Michael: Yeah. Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>35:55 Peter: Affirmative action is a drop in the bucket when it comes to, quote unquote, 'unfair', separate from your grades and shit, admissions. It is a fact that the score on your SATs is a better predictor of your parent's income than of your performance in college. Legacy applicants at Harvard get in at somewhere between a four times and nine times clip relative to non-legacies. Legacy admissions hover at around 90% White. 43% of White students at Harvard are legacies, athletes, or the children of donors and faculty. It's 43%. And Harvard is what percentage Black? Like 5%? And all these fucking White kids are looking at them and being like...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:42 Michael: "They do not... "</p>
                        <p>36:44 Peter: "You are not one of us, sir."</p>
                        <p>36:45 Rhiannon: Right. And it just highlights again how arbitrary the differentiation between the categories that we're concerned about, right? So bringing up that poor people aren't getting into college at the same rates because their parents aren't donors, or legacies, or whatever, that's not gonna concern the Supreme Court and...</p>
                        <p>37:06 Michael: Oh, you don't think the Constitution protects poor people? [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>37:10 Rhiannon: No, it definitely doesn't. And you know how I know it doesn't? It's because that case went to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court said, "Fuck poor people."</p>
                        <p>37:18 Michael: My sweet summer child.</p>
                        <p>37:20 Peter: And we will... We're gonna hit it. But these are government entities, these schools, discriminating based on who is a legacy admit, who is a donor, right? There is no particular reason that the Equal Protection Clause couldn't protect against that. The only real reason is that they're like, "Well, it's fine."</p>
                        <p>37:37 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>37:38 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>37:38 Peter: And the fact that you could easily tie a huge number of social ills to it doesn't mean anything to them. They have no interest in that. And again, it's 'cause these are their fucking friends. It's how fucking half of these people got into college, right? If they ever held that legacy admits to Harvard violates the Equal Protection Clause, their friends would just all stop talking to them.</p>
                        <p>38:00 Rhiannon: Right. And that's why, when you're bringing a question to the Supreme Court about, particularly, constitutional rights, you're telling yourself a lie if you believe that the Supreme Court Justices are going to go through any sort of objective analysis, right? It's about the justice's individual material realities, and what is subjectively important to them, their families, and the people that they know.</p>
                        <p>38:23 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>38:25 Peter: So Thomas has gone on the record numerous times, outside of court opinions, complaining about affirmative action. He has argued that the, quote, "Stigmatizing effects of affirmative action put him at a huge disadvantage when he was trying to find work as a lawyer. [chuckle] And I wanna put that in perspective by just kind of running through his career.</p>
                        <p>38:44 Michael: Right, I think that's...</p>
                        <p>38:47 Peter: Graduated from Yale, Yale Law, in 1974, was an Assistant Attorney General in Missouri until 1976. After that, worked for a few years at Monsanto Chemical, doing...</p>
                        <p>38:56 Rhiannon: Thank you for your service.</p>
                        <p>38:58 Peter: Just the kind of work you write home about. And in 1979, he goes back to his old boss, from when he was an Assistant Attorney General, who has now become a senator, doing legislative work. And then, in 1981 and in '82, he was Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education. And from '82 until 1990, he was the head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which means that, within eight years of graduating from law school at the age of 34, he was the head of one of the most prominent federal agencies in the country. To put that in perspective, at the age of 34, I am arguably one of the top 25 lawyers on Twitter.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>39:44 Michael: Could you imagine where he would have been if he didn't have this big... Affirmative action?</p>
                        <p>39:49 Peter: So, hold on, hold on. After that, he's nominated to the DC Court of Appeals, where he stays for about a year and a half, and then he is nominated to the Supreme Court at the age of 43, the youngest in the modern era, the youngest since 1939, and I think before that, sometime in the 1800s. And I guess, yeah, my question is, what does he think he would have done? He was at the top of the legal profession within 18 years of graduating from law school. So, what he's actually referring to, by the way, when he says he was at a huge disadvantage, is he tried to apply to a bunch of law firms, and they said no, despite the fact that he had great grades at Yale. And he said, "It's because they believed that I was the beneficiary of affirmative action." Did anyone say that to him? Not that I've ever heard.</p>
                        <p>40:35 Peter: I think it says a lot about the Conservative mindset here, that he has trouble getting jobs at law firms in the 1970s and assumes that the reason is affirmative action rather than the fact that he's fucking Black. He has great grades at Yale, which affirmative action cannot produce on its own, which means that those people, those attorneys evaluating him, they know he can compete with these Yale kids. And they still turn him down, and he's like, "This is affirmative action, I think." And that's why he thinks that his unbelievably unprecedented rise to the Supreme Court was unfair to him.</p>
                        <p>41:10 Michael: Never before or since has somebody...</p>
                        <p>41:12 Peter: Never will be again. No one... It would be shocking if someone... I wouldn't put it totally out of the question, but someone younger than 43 being nominated to the Supreme Court in this era, it just seems borderline impossible.</p>
                        <p>41:22 Rhiannon: That's wild.</p>
                        <p>41:23 Peter: It's crazy that it happened then. Also, he dodged sexual harassment allegations that were unbelievably credible.</p>
                        <p>41:31 Michael: Yes. Yes.</p>
                        <p>41:31 Peter: Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment while he was at the EEOC, including the allegation that he placed a pubic hair on a Coke can and then gave it to her, which has to be true, right? You can't make that up. That's not something you can make up. If that's made up, kudos to her. But if...</p>
                        <p>41:53 Rhiannon: And what she went through, right?</p>
                        <p>41:56 Peter: Just something that continued for years, Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginni Thomas, who is just like a standard bare Conservative moron, like a Donald Trump Junior-level intellect, in 2011, called Anita Hill and said, "I forgive you for your accusations against Clarence Thomas."</p>
                        <p>42:14 Rhiannon: I wish a bitch would. I absolutely wish a bitch would. And again, great grades at Yale or not, just want to emphasize these guys are dumb. And so, while we might want to keep grasping at straws...</p>
                        <p>42:29 Peter: There's all kinds of ways to be dumb.</p>
                        <p>42:29 Rhiannon: Right. We might wanna be grasping at straws, to be like, "What is the intellectual backing and foundation for why Clarence Thomas is the way he is?" Actually, the reality is like what Clarence Thomas is known for is sitting on the bench and not saying a fucking word because he doesn't really have...</p>
                        <p>42:48 Peter: Which is dope, though. That's cool. Clarence Thomas went for like... What was the length of time?</p>
                        <p>42:51 Rhiannon: Years.</p>
                        <p>42:52 Michael: Six years.</p>
                        <p>42:52 Peter: Six years without saying anything during oral argument, and oh, boss shit, dude. If you're at the top of your profession, you don't have a boss or anything, and one day he's just like, "I don't even have to... " He's like, "I don't even have to do anything." I just read a story about a lizard in a cave that stayed completely still for seven years. If I realized that I could do that, I would do that, just immediately, without even... I'd be like, "Oh my God, that's the next seven years." Yeah, I don't... So, I don't wanna hit him hard for that, because, to me, that's something that has my deep respect and admiration.</p>
                        <p>43:23 Michael: I'd be on Sudoku. I would be on my phone playing Sudoku.</p>
                        <p>43:25 Peter: Right, just openly watching videos.</p>
                        <p>43:29 Michael: Yeah, putting the headphones in.</p>
                        <p>43:33 Rhiannon: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. There's different ways to be smart, and the way Clarence Thomas figured out how to be smart is not having to work at his job. I don't think that it's any sort of a really compelling legal brain, right?</p>
                        <p>43:47 Peter: No, I mean, he has a frame... Certain frameworks he operates well within. When you're looking at his argument in this case, which is purely political argument, really, like policy-making argument, that's where he's at his weakest. You see him sort of just as this flailing kind of mediocre intellect. There are other ways where I think he can be hard to reckon with. If you're fighting him on his terms, if you agree with the way he approaches something, then he's often quite effective. If you take a step back from the way he approaches something, I think he rarely is.</p>
                        <p>44:17 Michael: Yeah, I think that's right.</p>
                        <p>44:19 Peter: This case takes place in 2013. In 2016, it crawls back up to the Supreme Court, and pretty much everyone thought affirmative action was going down. It was just gonna... This would be the end of race-based considerations, and schools would have to come up with this increasingly convoluted network of policies to try to replicate it. And what actually happens is that it goes 4-3, the other way. And very shocking that Kennedy seemed to kind of just all of a sudden choose the pro-affirmative action side. We have theories about why this is the case. I think the good faith theory would be that Kennedy was persuaded, that they just... They abided by the framework that the court laid out in the early 2000s, and that was that. The less good faith argument, the more legal realist argument, is that Kennedy realized that affirmative action, as it now stands, is a shell of what it once was, that it doesn't really do what the schools want it to do, that diversity at the top schools is garbage, and that they'd effectively won, and you can keep this system in place, and it doesn't really impact the relative privilege of the privileged class.</p>
                        <p>45:41 Michael: It's fucking weekend at Bernie's. It's like, "Oh, affirmative action survived. The corpse of affirmative action is present." And this is one of the effects of affirmative action being decoupled from the idea of reparations and inequities, and instead tied to diversity, which is Kennedy talks about these programs increasing diversity at UT. I wish I had the numbers here, but it's like increasing Black enrollment from 4% to 7%, or something like that, and Hispanic enrollment from 14% to 17%. Texas is a fucking majority minority state. Hispanics are 40% of the population. African Americans are 12% of the population. And I'm not saying that it needs to... Their student body needs to perfectly jive with that, but the idea that these minuscule increases that still vastly under-represent minorities can be framed as any sort of meaningful progress, that's the fucking Conservative victory right there.</p>
                        <p>46:50 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>46:50 Michael: Like that's it.</p>
                        <p>46:51 Peter: So what's Abby Fisher up to? How's she doing?</p>
                        <p>46:53 Rhiannon: She apparently...</p>
                        <p>46:54 Peter: Is this correct? I heard that South of the Texas Rangers stadium in Arlington, Texas, there's a traffic light, and it looks like a regular traffic light at first, but if you look close, it's actually Abigail Fisher and she's just holding up the colors, and that's her job now.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>47:10 Peter: Is that true? That's just something I heard.</p>
                        <p>47:11 Rhiannon: Yeah, basically, because... Basically, because she's a financial analyst at a bank.</p>
                        <p>47:16 Peter: Oh my God, even worse? I thought... I was like, "Wow, good for her. She's a traffic light now," but it turns out she's a financial analyst.</p>
                        <p>47:24 Rhiannon: Yeah, she graduated from LSU...</p>
                        <p>47:28 Peter: Sorry, Abby.</p>
                        <p>47:28 Rhiannon: Right. She graduated from LSU, works in finance, whatever the fuck that means. And wild to me, I wouldn't be so bold, but her LinkedIn is public and...</p>
                        <p>47:37 Peter: That is an unbelievable decision.</p>
                        <p>47:38 Rhiannon: She still looks like a spoilt glass of milk.</p>
                        <p>47:40 Michael: Did you just call her a spoilt glass of milk?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>47:44 Rhiannon: Yeah. Yeah. Out on the counter, in the sunlight.</p>
                        <p>47:47 Michael: Justified, justified strong opinions.</p>
                        <p>47:52 Peter: Look, I don't wanna make remarks about her looks, because inequitable commentary about attractiveness has been used historically to denigrate and marginalize women, but I do have one comment, which is, sometimes you look at someone with heritage from UK or Ireland, and you think maybe you need more than a small island...</p>
                        <p>48:15 Michael: For the genetic diversity.</p>
                        <p>48:16 Peter: Right, just from a genetic diversity standpoint, before you can consistently churn out normal, healthy-looking people.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>48:33 Peter: Alright. So I think that's it for this week. Next week, we are doing Shelby County v. Holder, a voting rights case. And now that I'm thinking about it, maybe a little too much racism back to back, but we're going for it.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>48:48 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>48:49 Peter: We're going right in.</p>
                        <p>48:50 Michael: I think this is the worst opinion of the Roberts court.</p>
                        <p>48:53 Peter: Yeah, that's probably right.</p>
                        <p>48:54 Michael: Buckle your seatbelts.</p>
                        <p>48:56 Peter: It's upsetting to read. It's gonna be upsetting to listen to.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>49:01 Michael: Get excited.</p>

                        <p>00:00 [Archival]: We'll hear argument today in Case 08-205, Citizens United versus the Federal Election Commission.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>00:07 Leon Neyfakh: Hey everyone, this is Leon Neyfakh, co-creator of the podcasts Fiasco and Slow Burn, bringing you this week's episode of 5-4. Today, Peter, Rhiannon, Michael are talking about Citizens United v. FEC, Supreme Court decision that allowed corporations to donate as much money as they want to the politicians of their choice.</p>
                        <p>00:26 [Archival]:: It has the potential to shake up the national political scene.</p>
                        <p>00:29 [Archival]: Five to four vote rules that corporations can contribute anything in political campaigns.</p>
                        <p>00:35 [Archival]: This really takes us into uncharted territory.</p>
                        <p>00:38 Leon Neyfakh: Citizens United resulted in billions of dollars being pumped into politics, all in the name of protecting the free speech rights of corporations and the rich people who run them.</p>
                        <p>00:47 Speaker 6: It has dealt a critical blow to our American Democracy.</p>
                        <p>00:51 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>

                        <p>01:02 Peter: Welcome to Episode 2 of 5-4, where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court decisions that have made this country, by a wide margin, the worst in the world. I am Peter, a.k.a. The Law Boy. I'm here with Michael.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Michael: Hey.</p>
                        <p>01:18 Peter: And from Austin, Texas, Rhiannon.</p>
                        <p>01:21 Rhiannon: What up?</p>
                        <p>01:22 Peter: And together we are the only three lawyers without a diagnosed personality disorder.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:27 Michael: Right. Not even limited to podcasts.</p>
                        <p>01:29 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>01:29 Peter: Not limited to podcasts. That's all lawyers.</p>
                        <p>01:32 Michael: All lawyers.</p>
                        <p>01:32 Peter: Worldwide.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>01:33 Peter: There have been some garbage fucking cases these... In this past month or so.</p>
                        <p>01:38 Michael: They've really... The five conservatives have outdone themselves, I think.</p>
                        <p>01:42 Peter: They have. If you had asked me, a couple of years ago, if you could just no scope a teenager across the Mexican border without any consequences at all, I would have said probably not.</p>
                        <p>01:56 Michael: No. That doesn't...</p>
                        <p>01:57 Peter: Doesn't sound right.</p>
                        <p>01:58 Michael: It doesn't seem like a close issue either.</p>
                        <p>02:00 Peter: No. But I was wrong about that. I was wrong about that. And that's why I'm not up there with the big boys on the bench.</p>
                        <p>02:05 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>02:06 Peter: Today, we are covering Citizens United v. FEC. Maybe the most symbolically important case of the past decade. A case that has kind of come to represent the impact of income and inequality on the political process and has become emblematic of the ideas that money is speech and that corporations are people and all of these kind of big concepts that sound completely ridiculous and are completely ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>02:38 Michael: That's right. And we... With this podcast, we're trying to show that the Supreme Court is not apolitical, that Justices have agendas and they push those agendas. And I think this is a prime case for that. The whole process that gave us this decision was just blatantly political and hard to hide what was going on here.</p>
                        <p>03:01 Peter: Yeah, absolutely. I do wanna point out... I think we're likely to get some criticism here because this is about big money in political advertising, and this podcast also runs some ads. But we... Our promise is that we will not be influenced by those companies nor will we ever advertise... And this is a guarantee, for a company that was instrumental in a genocide in the past 50 years. That's our promise to all of you. And you might criticize that promise saying, "Oh, it's unclear what instrumental means," or 50 years. That's not...</p>
                        <p>03:36 Rhiannon: That's just a couple of genocides.</p>
                        <p>03:37 Peter: But, first of all, there are a lot of genocides in there. Second of all, if you wanna criticize us, that's fine, we're able to weather that criticism 'cause we're built Ford tough.</p>
                        <p>03:46 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>03:50 Michael: And also beyond Citizens United, this is a nice time to talk about the First Amendment generally and the direction of the court, because we're also at just about 100 years even of First Amendment jurisprudence. The first Supreme Court, First Amendment case was in 1919, and obviously, 2019 just ended. If you look at the arc of the court's decision, the early cases seemed to be very concerned with minorities, the disenfranchised, the powerless citizens. You have anti-fascist leagues suing the government because they were put on some government watch list and the Supreme Court's saying that they can challenge their inclusion on that in the '40s, or the NAACP in the '50s, using the First Amendment as a shield. And this is, maybe, the case of all cases that sort of shows how the court's emphasis has shifted to protecting the wealthy and the powerful.</p>
                        <p>04:49 Peter: Yeah, so here in Citizens United, the court is asked whether McCain-Feingold, a 2002 law that bans outside political spending right before elections violates the First Amendment by unconstitutionally restricting a corporation's political speech. And the court says that not only does this particular ban violate the First Amendment, but in fact, any expenditure by a corporation at any time and for any amount is protected under a corporation's right to free speech. The idea that corporations have speech, is something that sort of slowly built up momentum until it hit this crescendo and turned into something that, I think, started off a little weird and is now just completely ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>05:30 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:30 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:31 Peter: So in this case, the party asking for the Supreme Court to weigh in is Citizens United, originally known as Americans for Bush. These guys are a political action committee founded in the late '80s to support George H. W. Bush in his campaign for president against Michael Dukakis. So Rhi, you wanna start walking us through the history, how does this get to the court?</p>
                        <p>05:53 Rhiannon: Americans for Bush are the people who produced the racist as fuck Willie Horton ad back in the late '80s. So it's about this furloughed Massachusetts prisoner who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman while he was out of prison, Bush accused Dukakis of not being tough on crime in that ad. It's racist. It shows the guy's mug shot, it's disgusting.</p>
                        <p>06:16 Peter: It calls him Willie Horton even though he didn't go by Willie. [chuckle] It's like extremely fucked up.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:21 Michael: Is that true?</p>
                        <p>06:22 Peter: It's 100% true.</p>
                        <p>06:23 Michael: I didn't know that. Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>06:25 Rhiannon: Yeah. Those guys who made that ad. Once Bush the first was elected, Americans for Bush turned into Citizens United. And they hired this guy, David Bossie. He is obviously obsessed with the Clintons in the '90s, running ads against Bill, Al Gore in 2000, and then, Kerry, John Kerry, of course, in 2004. This guy says that he's inspired by Michael Moore, and particularly Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 911, and he's inspired to make political documentaries. He starts with a rebuttal documentary that's called Celsius 41.11.</p>
                        <p>07:05 Peter: Whoa, punchy.</p>
                        <p>07:08 Michael: Mind fucking blown. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>07:13 Rhiannon: So creative. In an LA Times article in 2004, Bossie says, "After seeing Moore's impact, I wanted to counter-punch. Documentaries have become a weapon of the left."</p>
                        <p>07:22 Peter: Still true.</p>
                        <p>07:22 Rhiannon: Right, yeah, totally right.</p>
                        <p>07:26 Peter: If you record stuff, and then show people, what happens?</p>
                        <p>07:27 Michael: There's something so perfect in that.</p>
                        <p>07:30 Peter: And that's a weapon of the left. Photographs too, I feel the same way about them.</p>
                        <p>07:35 Rhiannon: So this guy obviously sees himself as a propagandist, right?</p>
                        <p>07:36 Michael: Right, absolutely. He's a political operative.</p>
                        <p>07:40 Rhiannon: Yeah, the problem with that is the FEC correctly identified that Citizens United was a political organization, it's not a bonafide movie studio commercial venture, and so they continue to restrict Citizens United's ability to air their movies in advance of elections.</p>
                        <p>08:00 Michael: Right, again, because McCain-Feingold, the campaign finance law, said at the time that corporations couldn't run ads for a federal candidate within a certain time period before an election, right.</p>
                        <p>08:11 Rhiannon: So David Bossie is like, "Hmm, I don't like that."</p>
                        <p>08:13 Michael: He's got the fucking answer to that.</p>
                        <p>08:15 Rhiannon: And he says, "Alright, well what if I turn Citizens United into an actual movie studio then?"</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:24 Michael: And I bet they turned out some quality shit.</p>
                        <p>08:27 Rhiannon: Yeah, Citizens United has made over 20 movies now, including several that have been written and directed by the garbage, smelly, Steve Bannon, such as Fire from the Heartland, the Awakening of the Conservative Woman.</p>
                        <p>08:46 Peter: Something tells me that's not a sexual awakening.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>08:50 Rhiannon: Which features Michelle Bachman, Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, etcetera.</p>
                        <p>08:55 Peter: Good stuff.</p>
                        <p>08:55 Rhiannon: One of the movies that they made was Hillary, the Movie. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>09:00 Michael: Even punchier than Celsius 41.11.</p>
                        <p>09:03 Rhiannon: Which Hillary do we...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>09:07 Rhiannon: And Citizens United wants to air this "documentary" in January 2008 to try to kneecap Hillary's primary run, they wanna get it to, obviously, to as many people as possible, and so they wanna put it on demand, but free to watch.</p>
                        <p>09:27 Michael: Right, they have an issue here, which is that there's campaign finance laws that say there's no corporate or union spending 30 days in advance of primaries or 60 days in advance of elections on electioneering communications. And so Citizens United, having been burned on this law previously sought a declaratory judgment in District Court saying, "Look, we're good to go. We're a movie studio. This is just a documentary." And the court was like, "No, you're not. And no, it isn't. Get the fuck out of here." And said they couldn't do it. And that was how we got to the Supreme Court with this case.</p>
                        <p>10:07 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>10:07 Michael: And so this starts on a very narrow question of whether the law is unconstitutional as it's applied to this documentary, and Citizens United is making a number of arguments that, look, the law doesn't really cover us or to the extent it does cover us, it's unconstitutional in those ways, and there's oral argument on this point in March of 2009, but the justices, the conservative justices were not satisfied with that. And they pushed Citizens United during oral argument on a much broader question of whether the campaign finance law and the restrictions on corporate spending were in their entirety unconstitutional, and this pisses off the liberals on the court. So David Souter, who's like a few weeks from retirement, writes a dissent that, according to some reporting is just airing all the court's dirty laundry, accusing the conservatives of blatant political machinations, and so somewhat shamed by this, actually cowed by a retiring justice ready to just put them on fucking blast they decide to set this case for re-argument and they're gonna make the parties brief them on the broader question of whether or not these campaign finance restrictions are constitutional at all.</p>
                        <p>11:37 Peter: Right, basically taking a very narrow question about some stupid movie and a very narrow law that applies to certain spending occurring within a month of a primary, and all of a sudden making it a case about corporate free speech that would apply in a huge array of context.</p>
                        <p>12:01 Michael: Right. The story, the detailed story is that at a conference originally, Roberts, Justice Chief Justice Roberts had written a majority opinion on the narrow question, and Justice Kennedy, who's very Libertarian, and which comes through in his writings, had wanted to write a concurrence on the broader constitutional question. But Roberts was persuaded by Kennedy and they decided to switch and that was when Souter started to write a dissent calling them out for being a bunch of fucking hacks, and it's important to realize a few things, which is, one, justices and judges in general, they have certain intuitions about the law and maybe on non-core issues, they can be persuaded one way or another, like some arcane workings of maybe patent law or some shit, they might be pursued-able. But these guys have ideas about the way the First Amendment works. They know what they think about things like campaign finance law. These are big issues that they've been thinking about for a long time.</p>
                        <p>13:11 Peter: They've been talking about it there, and all their friends have been complaining about it at fucking cocktail parties that they're at for 10 years.</p>
                        <p>13:16 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>13:17 Michael: Right, right, exactly. And there are just a number of ways they could have avoided ruling on this, which is generally speaking, what's required of the Supreme Court, is to avoid big constitutional questions unless absolutely pressed.</p>
                        <p>13:34 Peter: There's a doctrine called constitutional avoidance, which basically means if you don't have to answer to address a constitutional issue, you don't. And they flipped that completely on its head because they want to expand corporate speech rights and take a narrow question and turn it into a constitutional question.</p>
                        <p>13:52 Rhiannon: Right. You can't overstate how important it is that the petitioners themselves, Citizens United, as shitty an organization as it is, as awful a person David Bossie is and what they want the results of this case to be, that they didn't even ask for this result. This is the court really bending over backwards to fashion a case and a legal question so that they can... They're always planning backwards from the result that they want. And this is I think what makes Justice John Paul Stevens in dissent here, this is kind of a famous dissent of his, it's known as pretty intense, it's 90 fucking pages long.</p>
                        <p>14:31 Michael: Right. They wanted to avoid the shitty Souter dissent and instead they got the shitty Stevens dissent, and he's a better writer than Souter is.</p>
                        <p>14:37 Peter: Although 90 pages...</p>
                        <p>14:40 Michael: Nobody's gonna read it.</p>
                        <p>14:40 Peter: Believe, I didn't read that shit.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>14:44 Rhiannon: But what is good about the dissent is it does do that... Like there's a little peel back of the curtain, it's a little bit mask off where he's calling out what's going on. So he says, "It is only in the most exceptional cases that we will consider issues outside the questions presented. The appellant in this case did not so much as assert an exceptional circumstance, and one searches the majority opinion in vain for the mention of any. That's unsurprising for non-exists. Setting the case for re-argument was a constructive step, but it did not cure this fundamental problem. Essentially, five justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law."</p>
                        <p>15:26 Michael: It's very upsetting and my heart is pounding right now. [chuckle] I'm so worked up. But one thing I was thinking about is, one, I feel like you could go through law school very easily without ever reading this case. But two, even if you did, there's no way any of this shit is gonna end up in your case book. You're gonna read a little introductory paragraph from the author of the case book that basically tease up some of the bullshit issues, and then you'll read a few excerpted paragraphs from Kennedy's majority opinion about the First Amendment, and then maybe a few paragraphs from Steven's dissent. And this context is very important for understanding what this case is and what the court is doing here.</p>
                        <p>16:13 Peter: Yeah. It's ideological warfare and its express. It's as close as you can get to admitting that you just have this political goal you wanna achieve and you're gonna go do it. But yeah, I did learn about this case in law school, and I didn't learn about the history of it until I read about it myself.</p>
                        <p>16:32 Rhiannon: Right. It's taken for granted that this argument and the holding of the case are legitimately gotten to. The process was legitimate, and...</p>
                        <p>16:42 Michael: Right. And I think setting the case for re-argument after you had already written your majority opinion deciding the case one way along those questions is such obvious bullshit. There's no chance.</p>
                        <p>16:56 Peter: Real weird.</p>
                        <p>16:57 Michael: Right? There's no chance that they're actually going to change their mind at this point. This is about laundering it, it's about legitimizing what they're doing.</p>
                        <p>17:08 Peter: Alright, let's talk about the opinion itself. Michael, you wanna... You're the election guy. The election law guy.</p>
                        <p>17:16 Michael: I was briefly an election lawyer, I know a little bit about this stuff.</p>
                        <p>17:19 Rhiannon: After this episode, Michael will have no more expertise. [laughter] Michael peaks episode two.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:30 Michael: Alright, so just quickly going through the decision, and I don't think this decision is worthy of extended discussion other than to take a massive shit on it, so just describing its reasoning as briefly and succinctly as possible.</p>
                        <p>17:45 Rhiannon: That sucks ass.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:48 Michael: Yeah. Moving on...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>17:52 Michael: Obviously, when you're talking in abstract terms, the government banning speech sounds pretty bad. Censorship sounds bad. And in elections, of course, political speech is maybe the core of the First Amendment, that all sounds bad. Right? And so, there are portions of this opinion that you can be fooled into thinking sound reasonable.</p>
                        <p>18:15 Peter: Right. There are definitely a couple of big misconceptions about Citizens United, things that it's sort of... It's come to be associated with, although it's not really the case for those things. If you ever talk to a conservative or see a conservative academic talk about it, they all will say, "Well, actually you completely misunderstand the case." Because money as speech, that's a settled question. And whether corporations are people, that's a settled question.</p>
                        <p>18:39 Peter: But it's only really true in a narrow, almost semantic sense. There is absolutely no coherent, comprehensive explanation under federal law for why and to what extent corporations have constitutional rights at all, despite the fact they are not actual people. What there is, is a mish-mash of different theories of rights with no real consistent framework. And it's unclear why these entities created by state law, would be subject to federal constitutional protection. And some decisions have granted corporations due process and property protections, I guess you shouldn't... The Feds shouldn't be allowed to knock down a corporations door and steal their stuff. I would begrudgingly accept that that sounds right.</p>
                        <p>19:26 Michael: It depends on the corporation. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>19:29 Peter: But they haven't been expressly granted speech rights, and it's not really clear if they even could be. Right.</p>
                        <p>19:35 Michael: And so when we're talking about bans on free speech, you gotta think about what's required. You need a speaker, and in this case, that's the corporation. And of course, corporate person make sense, like corporations need to be able to sign contracts, and you need to be able to sue them. But whether or not that means corporations have feelings that they need to express, that... Like General Motors is really behind Mayor Pete in the 2020 Democratic primary and it feels it in its heart. That's pretty ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>20:09 Peter: And before we really dive in, I think one question needs to be addressed, which is... What's a corporation? What is a corporation? And there are all kinds of little fancy academic theories about what a corporation is. But it's a separate legal entity designed to allow people to more readily do business. You can hide all of your assets and liabilities in this entity, and it's controlled by management and it's owned by shareholders. And that's really the most you can say about it without getting into froufrou academic bullshit, I think. And the theory that they use and that courts have used for 200 years to give them constitutional rights and speech rights, is the idea that corporations are, "An association of citizens." It's like kind of settled law that... Then this makes sense, if you're a group of citizens, the fact that you're acting as a group doesn't nullify your free speech rights, right? Because you're an association of citizens, you're all acting together to speak and say something, so you get free speech rights makes sense.</p>
                        <p>21:14 Peter: But the idea that a corporation is an association of citizens is completely ridiculous. And it feels like it's based on an extremely antiquated idea of what a shareholder is... Like some prospector rolls into town and goes to the local general store and goes in, and there's like six pelts on the wall and a bottle that just says, Alexa. And he's like, "Oh, well, I like the look of this store. I'll give you a Buffalo nickel for 25%." And then the guy's like, "Oh, my... A buffalo nickel?" And now he's... The guy's a shareholder. But the modern system of shareholders is that you give Vanguard or some other brokerage firm your money, and they invest it for you in a bunch of shares chosen based on some algorithm that tells them how to change their capital allocation for risk purposes or whatever. They buy and sell some stocks for you and you have no idea what you own... No idea. Do you know what's in any of your...</p>
                        <p>22:19 Michael: Exchange traded funds?</p>
                        <p>22:21 Peter: Really... Who could possibly know? I have like A 401 [k], I have absolutely no idea what's...</p>
                        <p>22:26 Rhiannon: Do I have stocks?</p>
                        <p>22:26 Michael: Not for a while.</p>
                        <p>22:27 Peter: No, you don't.</p>
                        <p>22:29 Rhiannon: Okay, I didn't think so. Thank you.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>22:35 Peter: Most people have no idea what companies they have stock in, and that can't be an association of people. I can't be a part of an association of people when I don't know what the association is, right? The modern shareholder as like an entity is barely sentient, the idea that they're an association of citizens, such that they are able to express themselves and therefore deserve speech protections is just beyond absurd.</p>
                        <p>23:05 Michael: Right. The opinion tries to make itself seem like it's above basic sort of ideological concerns, and it mentions... Well, like Look, the Sierra Club is an association of individuals, and it's gotta be able to speak. But the Sierra Club is an advocacy group about people with...</p>
                        <p>23:23 Peter: That's their purpose.</p>
                        <p>23:24 Michael: A Shared interest in making political statements. That's the fucking point.</p>
                        <p>23:29 Peter: And that's why you join.</p>
                        <p>23:31 Michael: If you buy $500 of stock in Disney, because you heard that they're gonna buy Fox searchlight properties and you're gonna see Spider-Man in the Marvel Universe, that doesn't mean you have some fucking relationship with the other millions of people who hold stock in Disney and that now you have some coherent group viewpoint that you need to express in the political sphere... It's absurd.</p>
                        <p>23:57 Peter: Right. And it creates like... So you have this corporate entity, and then you have this inexplicably distinct Association of citizens that also has legal protections, and it's just allowing corporations to have their cake and eat it too. When they get sued, all of a sudden they are this... Just the corporate entity, right? And you can't sue the individuals who are part of it. And you have no remedy against any individual shareholder when they blast some baby in the face with sulfuric acid or whatever, because it increases the bottom line. But when they want free speech, all of a sudden, the shareholders are a part of it, and it's an association of citizens.</p>
                        <p>24:36 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>24:36 Rhiannon: Right. The whole point of creating a corporation is to limit individual people's liability and to create a legal entity that sort of takes the hit for legal problems in doing business... I don't fucking know what... I didn't take corporations. But what's clear is...</p>
                        <p>24:51 Peter: You didn't take corporations at all?</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>24:54 Michael: It was not required?</p>
                        <p>24:55 Rhiannon: No, of course, I didn't take corporations.</p>
                        <p>24:57 Michael: Well, it was my worst grade in law school, so I don't really have any ground to stand on. It was required...</p>
                        <p>25:02 Peter: I just rolled right up to the law school and I said, "Teach me about business."</p>
                        <p>25:06 Rhiannon: Yeah, you said. "Gimme, da corporate education."</p>
                        <p>25:10 Peter: Right.</p>
                        <p>25:11 Rhiannon: So one thing that's so, just infuriating to me is in the last substantive paragraph of the opinion, this is Anthony Kennedy, and so of course he's really... He's pulling out all the stops in terms of flowery, like how much we care about rights, all of this stuff. He loves that shit, but it's absolutely disgusting because actually, he like... Motherfucker, you're talking about corporations like these isn't actually people, so he's saying, The First Amendment, "Underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech, citizens must be free to use new forms and new forums for the expression of ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it." Fuck you, please. Suck my ass.</p>
                        <p>26:03 Peter: In conclusion, the United States is the greatest country on earth.</p>
                        <p>26:07 Rhiannon: Anthony Kennedy is still alive, right? 'Cause I just...</p>
                        <p>26:11 Peter: Not for long...</p>
                        <p>26:12 Michael: Unfortunately.</p>
                        <p>26:12 Peter: I'm not gonna kill him... I'm not gonna kill... It's just a statement about his age.</p>
                        <p>26:15 Michael: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>26:17 Peter: You're alright Michael. Michael is having like an actual...</p>
                        <p>26:23 Michael: Like a minor nervous breakdown.</p>
                        <p>26:24 Peter: Like an anger attack.</p>
                        <p>26:26 Michael: There's a point in this opinion, when Kennedy says like, "Look, some people point out, accurately, that corporations could still do all this shit that we're saying they can't do, they just have to have a political action committee. What's called a separate segregated fund, which means rather than from their general treasury, they have a separate fund that only shareholders and executives and employees can contribute to, that will then engage in political advocacy." And he's like, "First of all, that's a lot of regulations, and that's really hard, and they have to submit a lot of forms to the government, and I don't think that's really fair, that they should have to do that. And, in any event, if a corporation has a PAC that doesn't allow them to speak, the PAC is a separate entity with, I guess, separate thoughts and feelings from the corporation that created it."</p>
                        <p>27:29 Peter: Once you give from one entity thoughts and feelings, all of a sudden, they all have them and it becomes this incredibly convoluted mess of bullshit.</p>
                        <p>27:36 Michael: Right. The idea that a corporate-created Political Action Committee is a separate and distinct speaker for the sake of the First Amendment, than the corporation itself that created it is fucking ridiculous. And he says it... He writes it in a way that he's offended by the idea that anybody would suggest.</p>
                        <p>28:00 Peter: So, one of the big arguments brought up by the dissent, maybe the biggest argument, is the corruption argument, they're like, "Doesn't this allow for corruption? Right? If corporations can simply spend with the purpose of influencing elections isn't that corruption? And Kennedy says, "Well, the only thing that really counts is quid pro quo corruption. Like literally just, "Here's your money, I would like this political objective in exchange."</p>
                        <p>28:23 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>28:23 Michael: Right, and so Kennedy's argument is that since only direct quid pro quos count as corruption, any supposedly, "Independent campaign spending," meaning, spending that's not really directed by the candidate or the candidates campaign, that independent spending cannot actually be corruption for the purposes of the First Amendment, and that means you can't put any limits on it.</p>
                        <p>28:46 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>28:46 Michael: Whereas direct contributions could be part of a corrupt scheme, and so you could put limits on this.</p>
                        <p>28:53 Peter: Right, and this distinction is the heart of what makes this decision so ludicrous, right?</p>
                        <p>28:57 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>28:58 Peter: So, according to the court, giving direct contributions to a campaign can be limited, or in certain circumstances made illegal, but if you just run ads for the candidate on your own, that's independent and doesn't count, right?</p>
                        <p>29:10 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:11 Peter: This is how Super PACs became so powerful. Right? Their technical name is "Independent expenditure committees," and the idea is you form an entity whose sole purpose is to help a candidate or a group of candidates in an election, and as long as you don't directly coordinate with the campaign, the Supreme Court says, not only is that legal, but it cannot be limited due to the First Amendment, right? And this is as easily gamed as it sounds, right?</p>
                        <p>29:37 Rhiannon: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>29:37 Peter: So it was reported by Esquire, I think that in 2018, then Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, facilitated a meeting between a big donor and a Super PAC, the Congressional GOP Super PAC and because he was an elected official, he couldn't legally solicit a donation, right? So what does he do? He makes the pitch to the donor and then just leaves the room while the donor and the PAC representatives talk money, that conversation ends with a $30 million donation to the PAC. And despite the fact that the distance between the politician and the PAC in this case, is completely artificial and fraudulent, that's ostensibly legal under Citizens United, and certainly Paul Ryan is banking on it being legal.</p>
                        <p>30:21 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>30:23 Michael: No corruption there. And, yeah... And that's like... That's happening behind closed doors. But you have... Right out in the open, you have fucking Michael Bloomberg pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into elections.</p>
                        <p>30:32 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>30:33 Michael: For Democrats and Republicans, alike, and then bragging about it on national TV in a fucking Democratic primary debate, saying that he bought 21 congressmen, which, he's not a total idiot, he correct himself and he says he helped them get elected. But that shit slips out because he thinks that, he says that in private all the time, brags to his buddies at their little fucking cocktail parties, and the Supreme Court thinks that's okay, they say, "Look, that's not corruption, it's not even the appearance of corruption, 'cause he didn't directly coordinate with the campaigners."</p>
                        <p>31:08 Peter: Or if it's the appearance of a corruption, it doesn't matter.</p>
                        <p>31:10 Michael: Yeah, it doesn't matter, right.</p>
                        <p>31:12 Peter: Yeah, it's very fitting that a decade after Citizens United, you have Bloomberg, officially the ninth richest person in the world, just openly and unapologetically trying to purchase the Presidency of the United States with, what I think, no matter what happens, has to be described as some amount of success.</p>
                        <p>31:33 Michael: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>31:34 Peter: And, it's in large part because he's making huge donations to establishment Democratic politicians to win their favor, and those donations are considered protected free speech under Citizens United, right?</p>
                        <p>31:47 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:47 Peter: And the Supreme Court has said, "Not only is this not corruption, but it is sacred and untouchable free speech." Alright? And I can... The bottom line with the stuff to me is that, I don't think the conservative Justices care whether this is corruption or not, right? They know the Republican Party is fueled by big money, and this is just how the wheels are greased, right? And they're gonna get behind it one way or another.</p>
                        <p>32:10 Rhiannon: Right, it's clear from the opinion, they think that that's normal, they think that you should be able to do this. It goes back to couching it in this really flowery language, in the second paragraph of this goddamn awful opinion, Kennedy is quoting the evil one himself, Scalia, saying... Oh, we should note that this case overturns the Austin decision. And in Austin, the Supreme Court held that speech could be banned based on a corporate speakers identity, so there are some rules, there are some restrictions on corporate speech, but in this opinion, Justice Kennedy quotes Scalia, who said in another case, that Austin was a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles.</p>
                        <p>32:53 Michael: Ancient.</p>
                        <p>32:54 Peter: Ancient.</p>
                        <p>32:55 Rhiannon: Again, you have the mysticism around the law, ancient. Dude, the first amendment's like five minutes old. [laughter] What the fuck are you talking about? It's not ancient...</p>
                        <p>33:04 Michael: There was a longer gap between when the country was founded, and the first time the Supreme Court handled a First Amendment case, than...</p>
                        <p>33:12 Rhiannon: That's a really good point.</p>
                        <p>33:13 Michael: From then to now, this fucking ancient case isn't even half as old as the country. There are people alive today that are older than the oldest Supreme Court First Amendment case. This is not ancient, this is literally law that's been created in the lifetime of living people.</p>
                        <p>33:32 Peter: Yeah, but to be fair, it's just a couple of women in Japan.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>33:35 Michael: It's like five people, but... [laughter]</p>
                        <p>33:39 Peter: So the other thing that they basically do away with is the idea that the appearance of corruption matters, and this is a part of the law previously where the court had said, "Look, we want to not only do away with corruption, but also the appearance of corruption, so that people don't lose confidence in democracy."</p>
                        <p>34:00 Michael: Which makes sense, if democracy is powered by people, it starts with their investment in the process. Right?</p>
                        <p>34:06 Peter: Right, and the majority basically says, "Well, look, the public's not gonna lose confidence in democracy." And that's really it.</p>
                        <p>34:13 Michael: That's like a direct quote.</p>
                        <p>34:15 Peter: It is, and it's...</p>
                        <p>34:16 Michael: I have it.</p>
                        <p>34:17 Peter: Yeah, pull up the quote.</p>
                        <p>34:18 Michael: Yeah, let me get it. "The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy." That's the fucking Supreme Court...</p>
                        <p>34:32 Peter: That's reassuring though.</p>
                        <p>34:33 Michael: Holding forth...</p>
                        <p>34:34 Rhiannon: Yeah, thank you so much.</p>
                        <p>34:35 Michael: On this shit.</p>
                        <p>34:36 Peter: Thank you Anthony Kennedy for letting me know.</p>
                        <p>34:39 Rhiannon: I'm gonna sleep good tonight, I don't know about you guys.</p>
                        <p>34:42 Michael: The constitution has spoken.</p>
                        <p>34:43 Peter: Anyway, objectively false. Objectively fucking false. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:45 Rhiannon: Right, right, fucking wrong.</p>
                        <p>34:47 Peter: One of the many times, this is a classic thing that conservatives do, where they just assert this thing and you're like, "Isn't that an objectively measurable concept?" And then they just move on. Then the other, I think big and related thing, is the idea of free speech in relation to the audience. Free speech isn't just about the freedom of the speaker, it's about your freedom to hear what they gotta say. And so their majority is like, "The public has a right to access all the information, and then they determine the reliability of that information after the fact." And I think it's important to note that here we are in an era of constant, often purposeful misinformation and extensive research, showing that some percentage of people will believe it no matter what. And maybe we should be evaluating the rights of the listener to hear something with a little more nuance given our understanding of that. We live in a world where 40% of the population believes Hillary Clinton is a murderous pedophile, which means that 60% of the population is wrong about that.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>35:51 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>35:56 Peter: And there's also... Kennedy says, this is a direct quote, "There's no such thing as too much speech."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:02 Michael: Eat shit.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>36:05 Peter: Obviously, there are restrictions on the First Amendment. There are all kinds of, classic fire in a crowded theater sort of thing, you can't make direct threats, there are tons of restrictions on the First Amendment, so when you are a Supreme Court Justice writing, "There's no such thing as too much speech." How does that get by your clerks? Does none of your clerks are like, "This is obviously not true." But by the way, in 2007, there is a case where a guy held up a banner near a school that said, "Bong hits for Jesus."</p>
                        <p>36:35 Michael: And you were like, "Fucking expel that shit."</p>
                        <p>36:36 Peter: And the Supreme Court was like, "Well, that was near a school." You can't say bong near a school.</p>
                        <p>36:43 Michael: If you say 'bong' near a school, that's something different. If you're annoying people, that's really...</p>
                        <p>36:48 Peter: That's different.</p>
                        <p>36:49 Michael: That's different.</p>
                        <p>36:50 Rhiannon: I think a really important point to make too, is that saying something as asinine as, "There can't be too much speech," you just have to call that out as being so connected to capitalism. That the idea of a free market being a good thing, where there's just an excess of shit out there and everybody chooses for themself what shit they engage with and by, a quote like that, "There's no such thing as too much speech."</p>
                        <p>37:20 Peter: It's just free speech in the form of a Coca-Cola billboard outside your fucking apartment.</p>
                        <p>37:24 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>37:24 Michael: He even mentions the marketplace of ideas, which fucking drives me nuts because the marketplace of ideas is a great idea if we think, McDonald's makes the best fucking hamburgers that have ever existed. Right?</p>
                        <p>37:36 Peter: Right, right.</p>
                        <p>37:37 Michael: Because pretty much everybody, if they've eaten a hamburger and they've eaten a fucking McDonald's bullshit hamburger, and is that really... Is that what we're going for here? Is that the idea?</p>
                        <p>37:51 Peter: Have the best hamburgers won?</p>
                        <p>37:53 Michael: Well, that's...</p>
                        <p>37:54 Peter: Alright hold on, well let's... I wanna get into what I think is -- no joke -- the majority's only real decent point, which is that there's a weird tension here. If you're restricting the ability of corporations to spend on political expression, then what do you do about media corporations? And the majority puts this forward as just like, "Are you saying that you can restrict MSNBC or something?" Now, Justice Stevens in his dissent is just like, "Well, that question isn't even before us, this isn't a media corporation." Which is a good point, but also, let's be honest, a little bit of a dodge. But I think, perfect example of the conservative preference for rules, even if the rules are bad, rather than actually engaging with nuance and context, they would much rather have a bad rule, than give uncertain guidance to judges who might in their mind do the wrong thing with it.</p>
                        <p>38:54 Michael: Right. It sounds scary, right? And it does raise this concern, and if you're not really thinking too critically about it, you can be like, "Yeah, what if the government is like, no more CNN, where will I get my pro-Clinton news?" Or whatever. Right? I think the prototypical example of that would be like maybe a small independent film-maker with a strong political point of view trying to make a real artistic statement about the state of our society, like perhaps Michael Moore with Fahrenheit 9/11, which believe it or not, was able to be released within 30 days of an election over a complaint to the FEC because the FEC was able to very easily identify them as... His studio as a bonafide movie studio, and that this is a general political expression of the media, and this wasn't an issue. And what's amazing is that this was before the FEC because...</p>
                        <p>40:03 Rhiannon: Yeah, hey Michael, who lodged that complaint? Where did you get that complaint from?</p>
                        <p>40:06 Michael: Citizens fucking United. Citizens United tried to get Fahrenheit 9/11 pulled from the air, the same fucking company that's out here saying, "This shit is way too onerous," was trying to get media pulled like five years earlier. And that was their failed attempts to get Michael Moore silenced that inspired this whole thing.</p>
                        <p>40:33 Peter: Right. So what the court is trying to say is, "Look, it's hard to distinguish between types of speakers, and so it's best to just let them all do the same thing." But first of all, they don't actually do that, I referenced a case where there was a student on campus holding a sign that said "bong hits for Jesus", and they said it's okay to ban that because it's a student in a school. You're making these quantifiable judgments about the value or impact of speech based on the context, are we really pretending that the guy on the street corner with a sign saying "The end is near" is doing the same thing as the corporation that's lobbying the government for fucking changes in regulations in their own industry?</p>
                        <p>41:16 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>41:17 Peter: But that's what they're doing, that's what they're saying. It essentially means that the court sees no constitutional difference between a multi-million dollar expenditure by a corporation, and a nominal expenditure by an individual, none. What they're saying is, it's too hard to distinguish between those two things.</p>
                        <p>41:34 Michael: And the conservatives love doing this, they love talking about how difficult rules can be to be applied in the real world, but a common theme in the opinion is, we're sitting here banging on them about big, multi-million corporations that have tons of resources, and they're like, "Well, look, 96% of the Chamber of Commerce members have less than 100 employees and they're small businesses, and they can't handle this shit," and whatever, but the law easily distinguishes between those. There's a concept called a closely held corporation, and there's different laws that surround closely-held corporations. If corporations only have a few shareholders, and they don't really respect the formalities of the corporate form and have shareholder meetings and all that shit, they have duties to each other, and the laws are very different for them than they are for what Tesla stock owner owes, which is nothing to another Tesla stock owner, because that relationship is different and judges and courts have no problem distinguishing between them. And if the court was concerned about those corporations and their speech, they would have no problem distinguishing between them. They didn't wanna distinguish between them because what they want is to give fucking massively wealthy people and their corporate shells the ability to have a huge impact on elections, that's the goal.</p>
                        <p>43:00 Peter: I wanna get one point here before we talk about the impact of this decision, and that's that there was a concern here that this would open up a possibility of foreign intervention in elections. So this decision drops in late January 2010, couple of weeks later, State of the Union, Barrack Obama is talking about this, and he says that.</p>
                        <p>43:20 Barrack Obama: With all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations to spend without limit in our elections.</p>
                        <p>[applause]</p>
                        <p>43:36 Peter: And Samuel Alito, the conservative justice, Bush Jr, appointee famously mouths, "Not true."</p>
                        <p>43:44 Michael: Big scandal.</p>
                        <p>43:46 Peter: Not true. Big scandal, because a Supreme Court Justice was talking. You're supposed to just sit there and sort of look angry, I think instead he mouths his opinion.</p>
                        <p>43:57 Rhiannon: You're supposed to sit there in your robe looking important.</p>
                        <p>44:01 Peter: That's right. Very sort of... At the time it was just like, "Oh, he's talking back at Obama, very sassy Supreme Court Justice." And now it's like, "You sure about that Sammy?"</p>
                        <p>44:14 Michael: You really wanna be the guy who went down as history, as telling Obama that he was...</p>
                        <p>44:18 Peter: He's the guy who was like, foreign intervention in elections in 2010, "Absolutely not, Barack, no. You're an idiot Barrack, you don't understand this stuff at all." And just... There's no question that Citizens United... It creates a pathway through which foreign money can run into our elections, there's absolutely no way to avoid that fact as will be made clear by some of the numbers we're about to tell you. The impact of this decision on spending, spending that can come from any corporation is considerable.</p>
                        <p>44:51 Michael: Right. And so the thing about the corporate form is that it is a great vehicle for pretty much anyone to get their fingers into the electoral process now, and I don't think it's maybe, worth our time to get into detail about all the various different ways individuals, foreign or domestic can do that, but the main thing is that by opening up this avenue, you just invited basically everybody who wanted to do this to just form a little fucking LLC or whatever, and...</p>
                        <p>45:31 Peter: Right. Right. The definition of corruption in this context is so narrow that anyone who is not a complete and total incompetent can now funnel huge amounts of money into elections.</p>
                        <p>45:45 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>45:45 Rhiannon: Yeah, and I think the reason why I wanna do this podcast is, not just to show that the Supreme Court Justices are political and actually not objective, but also that they're dumb as shit.</p>
                        <p>45:56 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>45:56 Rhiannon: Everybody at the time...</p>
                        <p>45:57 Michael: Took the fucking words out of my mouth. Like, literally I was gonna be like, "Damn as shit."</p>
                        <p>46:01 Rhiannon: Everybody at the time was saying these would be the consequences. Corruption is a risk here. Foreign intervention is a risk here. This is what... And they were all like, "No. No way dog. That's not gonna happen."</p>
                        <p>46:14 Peter: If you read the Stevens dissent now you could look at it and be like, "Oh, he's fucking Nostradamus. This stuff all came true." Or you could realize any moron looking at this decision and understanding the basic framework of spending in elections could have predicted this stuff.</p>
                        <p>46:29 Michael: Fucking in 2018 Sheldon Adelson alone gave $122 million.</p>
                        <p>46:35 Peter: Casino magnet and one of the most disgusting people you will ever lay your eyes on.</p>
                        <p>46:40 Michael: Fucking Jabba the Hutt.</p>
                        <p>46:40 Peter: Just one of the most aesthetically disturbing people you will ever see in your fucking life. If you don't know what Sheldon Adelson looks like, just Google him right now. A-D-E-L-S-O-N.</p>
                        <p>46:50 Rhiannon: Google it.</p>
                        <p>46:51 Peter: He looks insane, just like an unbelievable human being. Barely human. I don't even think he deserves free speech rights. I don't think he qualifies a person. He looks like a nine-foot person was melted down into a normal person size. Sorry for that tangent.</p>
                        <p>47:09 Rhiannon: Yeah, so Michael said, in 2018 that Sheldon Adelson alone gives $122 million. And then just to compare that back in 2010, the year this decision comes out, the largest reported individual contributions totaled $7.5 million, so it's just ratcheted up.</p>
                        <p>47:25 Michael: It's a little bigger.</p>
                        <p>47:26 Rhiannon: Another big impact in terms of campaign spending being up is outside spending, which is referring to PACs, political action committees, operating independently of campaigns. So for example, in 2008 that outside spending totaled a little over $330 million. Fast-forward to 2016, we're talking in the billions now, $1.4 billion. And in 2018, the first midterm with over $1 billion in spending.</p>
                        <p>47:57 Peter: So one way to contextualize this is, has anyone listening to this podcast ever tried to max out their donation to a candidate? Because the maximum that you're allowed to donate is $2800 per candidate per cycle.</p>
                        <p>48:11 Rhiannon: If you've done that, call me, 'cause that means you have 3000 bucks.</p>
                        <p>48:15 Peter: That's also means you're rich. Yeah, that is a lot. So the end result of this, and by the way, those restrictions have been found constitutional. All of this highfalutin language about the importance of speech and shit has not prevented the Supreme Court from saying, "Well, yeah, you can cap individual contributions." And the result is that while you can only donate $2800, if you and some of your richer friends decide to form a company, pool together your millions, all of a sudden you can spend the whole fucking thing.</p>
                        <p>48:50 Michael: Right, and you wanna run an entire shadow campaign in parallel with the candidate of your choice. Yeah, you and your friends can do that too.</p>
                        <p>49:00 Peter: Just like a billionaire, you and your friends are allowed to run ads against or for the candidates of your choosing, so don't tell me that this country is unequal.</p>
                        <p>49:10 Michael: Right. The easiest way for a normal citizen to actively engage in the political process in a meaningful way beyond just talking to your neighbors is very restrained, whereas people with means can fucking go hog wild. There. Sorry.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>49:31 Peter: Oh my God, I love it. Michael is just ready.</p>
                        <p>49:34 Michael: I'm sorry.</p>
                        <p>49:35 Rhiannon: He's so worked up.</p>
                        <p>49:37 Peter: Ready to punch someone.</p>
                        <p>49:39 Michael: I mean...</p>
                        <p>49:40 Peter: We'll, after this we'll go punching people.</p>
                        <p>[music]</p>
                        <p>49:44 Peter: Next episode is Fisher v. Texas, which is, I think the best way to put it is the story about the dumbest white girl you ever heard. It's gonna be good. It's an affirmative action case. A great exploration of one of the more mediocre women you'll ever hear about in your whole life.</p>

                        <p>00:01 [Archival]: We'll hear argument now on No. 00-949, George W. Bush and Richard Cheney versus Albert Gore et al. Before we begin the...</p>
                        <p>00:11 Leon Neyfakh: Hey, everyone, I'm Leon Neyfakh, co-creator of Slow Burn and Fiasco. I'm here to introduce 5-4, a weekly Supreme Court podcast featuring America's most un-civil lawyers. On today's show, your hosts, Peter, Rhiannon and Michael are talking about a case that decided a presidential election, Bush v. Gore. The story starts on election night 2000, when Americans went to bed not knowing which candidate had won, because the vote in Florida was too close to call.</p>
                        <p>00:43 [Archival]: A vote so close that under Florida law, it must be recounted.</p>
                        <p>00:47 [Archival]: The Gore campaign, they will fight this issue of the Florida ballot until every vote is clear.</p>
                        <p>00:52 Leon Neyfakh: In the end, the Supreme Court effectively handed the presidency to George W. Bush.</p>
                        <p>00:57 [Archival]: The ruling strikes down the Florida Supreme Court recount plan as unconstitutional.</p>
                        <p>01:03 Leon Neyfakh: This is 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks.</p>
                        <p>01:13 Peter: Welcome to the inaugural episode of 5-4, a podcast about how much the Supreme Court sucks and the only Supreme Court podcast without a pending Title IX investigation.</p>
                        <p>01:23 Rhiannon: That's right.</p>
                        <p>01:25 Michael: Very proud of that.</p>
                        <p>01:25 Peter: We are. Each episode, we're gonna dissect one of the many Supreme Court decisions that make all of our lives just a little bit worse every single day. And today is a big one, Bush v. Gore, maybe the most shameless decision in Supreme Court history. But before we really dig in, we wanna go around the room, talk about who we are, why we're doing this, and how much we're getting paid. I am Peter, better known on Twitter, at least, as The Law Boy.</p>
                        <p>01:54 Michael: The world's daintiest lawyer.</p>
                        <p>01:56 Peter: America's daintiest lawyer. No...</p>
                        <p>02:00 Michael: There might be some daintier lawyers in...</p>
                        <p>02:00 Peter: No opinions.</p>
                        <p>02:01 Rhiannon: There might. There are others, yeah.</p>
                        <p>02:03 Peter: And I go to work and instead of working I think of tweets about the law and politics.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>02:11 Peter: Michael.</p>
                        <p>02:11 Michael: Sure, yeah. I'm Michael. I am a reformed corporate attorney and former election lawyer and now I am doing bigger and better things like...</p>
                        <p>02:23 Peter: Podcasts.</p>
                        <p>02:23 Michael: Podcasts. That's right.</p>
                        <p>02:25 Rhiannon: And I'm Rhiannon and I do public defense work in the South.</p>
                        <p>02:29 Peter: Okay, well, there's no need to get like showy. We understand that you're the only one who's a real lawyer here.</p>
                        <p>02:36 Michael: Wow, somebody's putting her degree to work to make the world a better place.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>02:41 Peter: Right. So we wanted to do this podcast for a few reasons. I think both the public and the legal profession have bestowed upon the Supreme Court a completely unearned and undeserved reverence, and there's an illusion that it's apolitical and independent and generally sort of above the fray, when in reality, it is deeply political, deeply ideological, and always has been. And the result of this reverence is an institution that takes itself so seriously that Supreme Court Justices wear their robes in public just for no reason at all. Like, if you watch The State of the Union, they're all just sitting there in robes, like they're just a completely different kind of person than anyone else. Wear a fucking suit like a normal person.</p>
                        <p>03:33 Rhiannon: Yeah, imagine wearing your work uniform anywhere other than when you're at work.</p>
                        <p>03:37 Peter: Well, first of all, let's imagine that your fucking work uniform is a robe.</p>
                        <p>03:40 Rhiannon: It is a black dress-y thing.</p>
                        <p>03:42 Peter: You're a judge. Okay. You're not a deity. Just roll over to fucking Brooks Brothers and do what we all do. Anyway, why did you guys wanna do it?</p>
                        <p>03:55 Michael: For me, when I read these opinions in the law generally, I feel like there's a subtle or maybe not so subtle gatekeeping aspect that goes on, which is they are just laden with jargon and citations that really are impossible to understand unless you've been trained on them, like Latin terms, all sorts of legal terms of art. And it gives them sort of an air of legitimacy where a layman trying to understand what's going on would just be, like not even understanding where to start. The first time I tried to read a Supreme Court opinion, start to finish in law school, I spent 10 minutes reading something and being like, "This is so weird, this is not like the case books I knew as the syllabus." Which I didn't even know was a thing that existed, and it's not a part of the formal opinion. As a law student, I had no idea what I was doing and how to work my way through it. So if we want to do what we're setting out to do, which is show everyone how much bullshit this all is, an important part of it is stripping away all the finery that adorns this.</p>
                        <p>04:58 Peter: Well, yeah, like the robes.</p>
                        <p>05:00 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>05:01 Michael: Right. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>05:04 Rhiannon: No, I really like that framing of this mythos and this idea that this stuff isn't accessible to the layman, it serves everybody's career interest and keeps those people kind of in power. There's just this idea that the Supreme Court is a group of nine, sage, unbiased legal titans. That they have these special knowledge and skills, they answer legal questions for the whole country, and they do it objectively. So famously, Chief Justice John Roberts, during his confirmation hearings, he says, right, that like, "I view the role of the judge on the Supreme Court as an umpire, and we just call balls and strikes."</p>
                        <p>05:43 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>05:44 Rhiannon: When actually what the Supreme Court does is ideological judicial law-making all of the time. And I think hopefully in the podcast, we can kind of demystify that process a little bit and expose those contradictions.</p>
                        <p>05:58 Peter: Yeah, and show everyone that nine Justices that compose the Supreme Court are not the smartest people in the country.</p>
                        <p>06:03 Rhiannon: No.</p>
                        <p>06:04 Peter: We are.</p>
                        <p>06:04 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>06:04 Rhiannon: Yes. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>06:07 Peter: So we wanted to start with Bush v. Gore, because I think it's the case that embodies the central thesis of this show, which is that the Supreme Court is driven by politics and ideology first and foremost. And there is no greater representation of that than Bush v. Gore, a case in which the five Republican justices on the Court tied themselves into knots to hand the election to George W. Bush. It's 2000, the '90s have been pretty good to everyone, and you have this sort of common election archetype of the boring guy, Al Gore, versus the idiot, George W. Bush, and it's like it's a very common type of election in America, and it is a huge advantage to the idiot.</p>
                        <p>06:58 Rhiannon: That's right, yeah.</p>
                        <p>07:00 Peter: But the one thing I'll also say is that Bush was dumb in a way that now seems, like, very quaint, where he would say a word wrong, he would say strategery instead of strategy, and people were like, "Oh, my God, can this man really be President?" And that just seems so distant in a world where we have Trump, who's just like a character you forgot about in The Sims, just wandering from room to room with like a thought bubble with a picture of a hamburger in it above his head, just has never had a thought that was not a reaction to direct physical stimulus.</p>
                        <p>07:37 Rhiannon: Nowadays, I yearn for a President whose biggest issue is that he says "nucular", nuclear.</p>
                        <p>07:40 Michael: Nucular.</p>
                        <p>07:42 Peter: Nucular. Which by the way, is how pretty much everyone said it. I feel like that was the first time most people learned how to pronounce that word.</p>
                        <p>07:50 Michael: Yeah, people were like, wait.</p>
                        <p>07:55 Peter: Rhi, we should, let's start talking law. Alright?</p>
                        <p>07:56 Rhiannon: Yeah, for sure.</p>
                        <p>07:57 Peter: What happens?</p>
                        <p>07:58 Rhiannon: Yeah, no, before we get to the law, I wanna be clear that I was, on November 7th, 2000, I was 12 years old. I had just shaved my head, I'm in sixth or seventh grade, Palestinian, small little olive in suburban Texas on election night. Did you guys do this when you were younger, is like you color in the map, the states you color it blue or red for whoever it goes for?</p>
                        <p>08:28 Peter: Yeah, I still do that.</p>
                        <p>08:29 Rhiannon: Yup. And so I...</p>
                        <p>08:30 Michael: I smoked way too much pot, my memory is very vague.</p>
                        <p>08:33 Rhiannon: I can't overstate how important it was to me at that time that I was a good student. And so it fucked with me, it traumatized me that I had done red and then blue on Florida, and I just thought, you know what, I failed this assignment, I fucked up. So it was really traumatic. Yeah, so all the major networks that night, they called Florida for Gore.</p>
                        <p>08:58 [Archival]: A big call to make, CNN announces that we call Florida in the Al Gore column.</p>
                        <p>09:04 [Archival]: We're gonna now project an important win for Vice President Al Gore. NBC news projects that he wins the 25 electoral votes in the state of Florida.</p>
                        <p>09:12 Rhiannon: But then retractions started at around 10:00 PM.</p>
                        <p>09:15 [Archival]: We now believe the state of Florida is too close to call.</p>
                        <p>09:18 Michael: That's weird.</p>
                        <p>09:19 [Archival]: We and most other news services had called it for Mr. Gore. We now believe it's too close to call.</p>
                        <p>09:22 Rhiannon: The networks start switching their calls to Bush.</p>
                        <p>09:24 [Archival]: Now projects George W. Bush the winner in Florida, and thus it appears the winner of the presidency of the United States.</p>
                        <p>09:31 Rhiannon: And then by morning, people wake up and it's undecided.</p>
                        <p>09:34 [Archival]: If you take 25 votes away from Al Gore and put it in the undecided column, and should they break for Bush, the entire...</p>
                        <p>09:40 Rhiannon: On November 8, the next day, the Florida's Division of Elections, they say that Bush won by a really small margin, it's like 1,700 votes, which is less than the 0.5%, which means basically that a mandatory recount is triggered. And by November 10th, the machine recounts have brought that lead down to around 300 votes, so...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>10:06 Peter: This is such a shitshow, dude.</p>
                        <p>10:06 Rhiannon: Right, right, it's a fucking mess, is what it is.</p>
                        <p>10:10 Michael: Yeah, yeah.</p>
                        <p>10:11 Rhiannon: And Gore requests manual recounts in four counties, and the shit show just gets more intense from there. In Palm Beach County, for example, 10,000 ballots were set aside because they recorded no vote for president at all. In Volusia County, they record Gore receiving negative 16,000 votes, so it's just... It's like what the fuck is going on.</p>
                        <p>10:36 Peter: That turned out not to be an error, so that was just... He's not that popular in Volusia. Even as a teenager witnessing this, it was just like peeking under the veil of American politics and seeing this horrible writhing mess beneath, where everything was deeply corrupt and inaccurate and full of just human error and dark motivations, and it was just the first time I think that a light had been shined on this part of the system, and it was deeply unsettling to everyone.</p>
                        <p>11:15 Michael: I was 18 at this time, and I lived in Fort Lauderdale in Broward County, which was sort of ground zero for all of this, it was one of the four counties that were supposed to do a manual recount, along with Miami-Dade and a couple others.</p>
                        <p>11:27 [Archival]: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Volusia, each with more registered Democrats...</p>
                        <p>11:32 Michael: Yeah, I voted in the election, so I do not know if my vote was actually ever counted, and there were just bizarre protests and it was all anybody talked about, and it's hard to really explain what it's like to have that be your first electoral experience. Even before all the election shenanigans, there was like the 50,000 voters that got purged from the Florida voter rolls because they are supposedly felons, but it turns out a lot of them weren't felons, they were maybe misdemeanors, maybe no crime at all. And they're all black or Hispanic, and one estimate says that cost Gore 5,000 votes in an election he lost by 300 votes. A lot of the madness, it was just inevitable and organic, and there's a lot of tension because people don't really know what's gonna happen, but some of it was just this manufactured bullshit, most famously, the "Brooks Brothers riot" which...</p>
                        <p>12:30 Rhiannon: I have a question. What is a Brooks Brothers...</p>
                        <p>12:33 Peter: It's like a menswear store. I knew the question immediately. Yeah, it's just a suiting store.</p>
                        <p>12:41 Michael: Yeah, they make...</p>
                        <p>12:43 Rhiannon: Like fratty?</p>
                        <p>12:43 Peter: No, it's just like your standard bare mid to low range, like the... You first... You go to Men's Wearhouse, and then you realize that that's not nice enough for your fancy job.</p>
                        <p>12:53 Michael: Right, you don't actually like the way you look.</p>
                        <p>12:55 Peter: Yeah, and then...</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>12:56 Michael: And so they...</p>
                        <p>12:57 Peter: And then you go to Brooks Brothers to pay like $700 for a suit that some fucking idiot sells you, and then like...</p>
                        <p>13:05 Rhiannon: Great. So...</p>
                        <p>13:05 Michael: And so...</p>
                        <p>13:06 Rhiannon: A riot happens there.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>13:08 Michael: Yeah. That's not...</p>
                        <p>13:10 Peter: It's not at Brooks Brothers. It's...</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>13:12 Michael: Right. The Brooks Brothers was unscathed, thankfully. Basically what happened was in Miami-Dade, there were these 10,000 or so ballots, undervotes, right? These ballots that hadn't recorded votes, and we're getting close to one of the deadlines here, and Miami-Dade's concerned about being able to recount all the votes, so they say, "Well, we're gonna look at these 10,000 ballots." And they kind of retire to a smaller room so they can segregate them out and start manually assessing each ballot, and there was a lot of concern that there would be enough votes for Gore in this batch to change the outcome of the election. So Republicans flew in all these 40 to 50 year-old lawyers. Of course, they're almost all lawyers.</p>
                        <p>14:02 Peter: And when we say Republicans, like the actual Republican Party in DC.</p>
                        <p>14:07 Michael: Right, no, this is like, yeah, this is like Roger Stone, who's a fucking Republican rat fucker back into the '70s, a Nixon guy, and...</p>
                        <p>14:17 Rhiannon: He's the one with the Nixon tattoo, right?</p>
                        <p>14:19 Peter: That's right.</p>
                        <p>14:19 Michael: That's correct.</p>
                        <p>14:20 Rhiannon: Got it. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>14:20 Michael: Dresses like a villain in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. [laughter] It's all Republican aides and lawyers who fly in. They're all on their Blackberrys. They're all in their fancy suits protesting, and they get violent. They're punching people. Someone from the DNC is literally assaulted. And they succeed. They shut down this recount like two hours after they get fucking crazy.</p>
                        <p>14:53 Peter: Which is very important to note that this is the only successful riot in American history. Every time that someone is protesting police violence or whatever, they just get fucking wiped out with tear gas, but fucking 50 Republican lawyers show up in Miami-Dade and they're like, "Well, whatever they want."</p>
                        <p>15:14 Michael: Just go break some windows.</p>
                        <p>15:14 Peter: Whatever they want. Just let us know.</p>
                        <p>15:16 Rhiannon: Well, and all they had to was...</p>
                        <p>15:17 Peter: Let's immediately capitulate."</p>
                        <p>15:19 Rhiannon: All they had to do is act exactly how they do with their wives and got their way.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>15:28 Peter: Oh, shit!</p>
                        <p>15:30 Michael: Jesus. [laughter] But I think it's good to talk about the riot, because it's a good preview for the next 20 years of Republican politics and the way they treat elections generally and Democrats, and the idea that any Democratic efforts at getting votes counted are illegitimate and fraudulent, and they can take whatever means necessary in their hands to shut that down. All they gotta do, all they wanna do is win elections, so they don't give a shit.</p>
                        <p>16:00 Peter: And maybe the most emblematic aspect of how on its face corrupt the entire process was, is Katherine Harris. [chuckle] Who is the Florida Secretary of State. And in her role as the Florida Secretary of State is responsible for oversight of the elections and the certification of the results. But she's also the co-chair of Bush's campaign in Florida. And if you want to understand what type of person she is, I think that she's another type of important American political archetype which is, there are movies about where the protagonist is like a mother and the antagonist is a woman who is extremely mean and through sheer belligerence and force of will dominates the local PTA?</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>16:52 Rhiannon: Sure.</p>
                        <p>16:53 Peter: You guys know what I mean?</p>
                        <p>16:54 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>16:55 Peter: And she wears a little too much make-up and you're like, she just seems like a force of nature, just plowing through everything in front of her to get whatever she wants and at the expense of the children. Usually. Which is why I think this archetype was made famous a few years later with Sarah Palin, who's the real embodiment of it. And then you had a couple others like Michele Bachmann, and but I think Katherine Harris was the first time PTA mom who was on the political scene in America and American life. So she was the one that oversaw the purging of the voter rolls on the grounds that they were ostensibly felons, even though maybe not. And she's the one that sort of starts over, like is in charge of the oversight of this process and was just nakedly corrupt and favoring Bush at every single step, not even trying a little bit to hide it.</p>
                        <p>17:51 Michael: Which I mean, her boss was Bush's brother.</p>
                        <p>17:56 Peter: Yeah, that's right.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>17:57 Michael: And they're both Republican...</p>
                        <p>18:00 Peter: Yeah, yeah. Minor point. Governor of Florida, fucking Jeb Bush.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:04 Peter: Jesus Christ!</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>18:06 Peter: Alright.</p>
                        <p>18:06 Rhiannon: At the time, Florida law required that votes be certified within seven days of the election. So the Florida Circuit Court ruled that counties had to certify their results, but they could amend at a later date at the Secretary of State Katherine Harris's discretion. So what happened was, she issued criteria for these late filings, and she asked that the counties that were late in filing, that they provide their justifications for why they were late.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>18:36 Michael: That sounds fair.</p>
                        <p>18:37 Rhiannon: No. Well, she proceeded to reject them all outright. [laughter] And declared that she's gonna certify the results the next day anyway.</p>
                        <p>18:44 [Archival]: Florida's Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, has announced that she is rejecting any further efforts...</p>
                        <p>18:50 [Archival]: The reasons given in their requests are insufficient to warrant waiver of the unambiguous filing deadline...</p>
                        <p>19:00 Peter: Well, okay.</p>
                        <p>19:00 [Archival]: Florida Legislature.</p>
                        <p>19:00 Rhiannon: Everything is above board, guys.</p>
                        <p>19:02 Peter: She says it's her... Look, it's her prerogative so.</p>
                        <p>19:04 Rhiannon: Right, yep, okay, the Florida Supreme Court is then like, "Ahh, wait a minute," they step in and they enjoin her from certifying those results, which allows the recounts to continue. Republicans of course are pissed and on December 8th, following a bunch of legal, more legal bullshit, the Florida Supreme Court ordered a state-wide manual recount.</p>
                        <p>19:32 Peter: Yeah, and then that's where Bush petitions the Supreme Court, not for the first time during this case, but for the first time that really matters, I think, to stay the recount. And to halt the recount in this case what you need to do is show that if it proceeded you would be irreparably harmed, which is usually... Like a good example of irreparable harm is like someone is about to destroy priceless antiques, that literally people are like cannot be replaced and not subject to any monetary value and a court might be like, "Alright, don't do that because if you do it we can't reverse it," that's the whole point.</p>
                        <p>20:10 Peter: So the Supreme Court grants it despite the fact that there's almost no question that there's no real irreparable harm of allowing the recount to continue. The dissent in that case, which goes 5-4, considering Republicans versus Democrats, essentially, says, "How can counting every vote be irreparable harm?" And the retort from the majority is, "Well, no, no, that's not what we're saying. What we're saying is that if you accidentally count illegal votes, non-legal votes, that would be irreparable harm." But it doesn't make any sense at all, you could just let it continue and then if you want to impose standards on it after the fact or scrap the whole thing, you could easily do that.</p>
                        <p>20:51 Michael: It's the definition of reparable harm, you could just say no, actually votes that are just dimples and not punched-out chads don't count and they're all subtracted from the totals and that's it.</p>
                        <p>21:03 Peter: After this happens, it seems pretty clear how the whole thing is about to shake out, because you still have the main case that essentially decides whether a recount will eventually continue, that's coming up in a couple of days, and now that this has gone 5-4, it seems pretty clear that that's gonna go 5-4 too.</p>
                        <p>21:20 Michael: Right. So I've been thinking about this and the one thought I had about why issue the stay that makes the most sense to me is this, at one point the margin was like 1700 votes, that came all the way down to 320 votes or whatever, and if you're sitting there saying, "Well, in four days we're gonna say this recount is a no go," the last thing you want is in between now and then for the results to switch. You'd much rather be affirming a very thin lead for Bush than saying, actually...</p>
                        <p>21:52 Peter: Well, that's exactly why they did it, 'cause Bush had the lead, so imagine you are a conservative Justice who just so happens to have one goal and that's electing a Republican president, what would you do? Bush has the lead now, you can't risk it, you halt it right now and then whatever decision you eventually make will be made under the presumption that Bush is the de-facto winner.</p>
                        <p>22:12 Michael: Right, so that's sort of where their heads are with the stay, I think pretty clearly, they need to essentially find a reason to invalidate the recount but also need to find a reason that the recount can't be restarted or redone. And that's kind of a problem, because if there's a problem with the recount, the obvious solution is to just fix it and count the votes. So how they do this it's, there are two pieces to it, one is they talk about the The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and they need to do this because also these are all state laws and so they really don't have any place to be weighing in on this in any event, so they need to find a federal hook. So the federal Constitution says, all the citizens are guaranteed equal protection under the law. And the Supreme Court says, "Well, look, if you count votes one way in one county and you recount them another way in another county that doesn't sound very equal to me."</p>
                        <p>23:10 Rhiannon: Right, which is completely wrong and just flies in the face of how elections are done. When we're talking about different standards being used in different counties, so during the recount, it's looking at the voter, I guess is it a punch card, Michael?</p>
                        <p>23:28 Michael: It depends, but there are some that were punch cards, yeah.</p>
                        <p>23:30 Rhiannon: Right, the Supreme Court is now looking at this and saying, during this recount different counties are applying different standards to what they're saying is a vote or is not a vote for a certain candidate. So if something is partially punched through or there's a hanging chad or a dimple, there aren't uniform standards across the state for how we're counting these votes and the thing is, is that's how all elections are working.</p>
                        <p>24:00 Peter: Right, but the weird thing about this is that it's not the craziest argument that there are different standards for how you count votes across different counties, is that a violation of Equal Protection? The point, though, is that if it is, then every presidential election in US history has been invalid under the Equal Protection clause. And the majority has a very weird situation on their hands where they found... They need to find this Equal Protection violation, but you need to get around the obvious implications of it, which are that all elections are invalid under the the Equal Protection clause, at least all federal elections, any federal election I could think of, maybe outside of House elections, and how do they do that? They do that just by putting in a paragraph that says, "By the way, this doesn't apply...</p>
                        <p>24:51 Michael: This doesn't count. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>24:52 Peter: To anywhere else," and so they really do this and they say, "Well, this is only applicable to this election, this recount right now, it doesn't apply anywhere else." Which is A, absurd and B, I don't even recognize their right to do. I don't think that a court can say, "Oh, ignore the implications of my reasoning and just limit it to this." If you can't tighten the reasoning so that it's only applicable to this situation, then you have to deal with the consequences of that.</p>
                        <p>25:20 Rhiannon: And the Supreme Court, in the opinion, they give a lot of attention and energy to this idea that you don't really have an individual right to vote in this country under the Federal Constitution, until the state vests this power in the people, which is to say that...</p>
                        <p>25:37 Peter: They actually... They lead off with that.</p>
                        <p>25:38 Rhiannon: Yeah. They set these standards.</p>
                        <p>25:39 Peter: The whole concept that there's no constitutional right to vote, which is true. And it always cracks me up whenever you do it, read a voting rights case, 'cause you have to lead off with, first of all, FYI, there's no constitutional right to vote.</p>
                        <p>25:50 Rhiannon: Surprise.</p>
                        <p>25:50 Peter: Which I know, and I think every law student knows, but I think that if you asked the average person if there is a right to vote under the Constitution, they'd be like, "Well, yeah, of course. That's like the building of... That's the cornerstone of our democracy."</p>
                        <p>26:02 Rhiannon: That's fucking America.</p>
                        <p>26:02 Peter: Actually, no, motherfucker, fucking Thomas Jefferson thought you were an idiot.</p>
                        <p>26:05 Rhiannon: Right. [laughter]</p>
                        <p>26:08 Peter: And they were like, "Oh, instead... " The state will appoint, whatever, 37 monocled freaks [chuckle] to...</p>
                        <p>26:17 Michael: To make these decisions.</p>
                        <p>26:19 Peter: To decide what's best for the state. And so the courts have jumped through hoops to sort of create, what is now functionally a constitutional right to vote, but doesn't really exist in the Constitution itself.</p>
                        <p>26:31 Michael: And part of the background for that, by the way, is that there were talks around this time that the Florida legislature, they would just declare Bush the winner. The recount be damned, the Florida Supreme Court be damned. They'll just pass a law that says Bush won, and then they'll send Bush electors to the Electoral College, and that'll be that. And I think that this was a little bit of the Supreme Court being like, [chuckle] "That's constitutional, if they wanna do that." Just so you know.</p>
                        <p>27:00 Rhiannon: Right. Right.</p>
                        <p>27:00 Peter: That's what they wanted to do. So that's how they invalidate the recount, right? That's step one. You find this bullshit Equal Protection argument. But now you still have this second problem, which is, how do you utilize a reasoning that prevents the recount from being restarted or redone?</p>
                        <p>27:20 Michael: 'Cause that's the obvious answer to that, which is like still let's get all the votes counted and find out who won.</p>
                        <p>27:26 Rhiannon: Exactly.</p>
                        <p>27:26 Peter: You have a constitutional violation. How do you fix it, right? So that's the question, and they answer it by saying, "You can't fix it by using this obscure safe harbor provision, which states that if your electors are submitted by December 12th, 2000, they are guaranteed to be counted by Congress." And by the way, this opinion is issued on December 12th.</p>
                        <p>27:47 Michael: Right. This law, this federal law...</p>
                        <p>27:50 Peter: This obscure law.</p>
                        <p>27:50 Michael: Basically says, "If you don't want the results of your election to be challenged by Congress, they just need to be submitted by this date."</p>
                        <p>28:00 Peter: If you do it after that, then Congress can technically intervene, although in reality, I think they never would.</p>
                        <p>28:05 Michael: It would be bizarre.</p>
                        <p>28:06 Rhiannon: I think it's actually important to note too that using that, this safe harbor provision, it's not essential. It doesn't apply to everybody in the year 2020...</p>
                        <p>28:14 Peter: Yeah. Most states don't use it.</p>
                        <p>28:15 Rhiannon: States don't even use it.</p>
                        <p>28:17 Peter: And the question here is, does Florida care more about the safe harbor provision, which is relevant once a century, or about an accurate count of the votes of their constituents for President? It's a rhetorical question when I say it.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>28:34 Michael: Right. But for the Supreme Court...</p>
                        <p>28:36 Peter: Not everyone views it like that.</p>
                        <p>28:38 Rhiannon: Right. And just to highlight how kinda shoddy the reasoning is in this opinion, number one, first of all, it's per curiam, which I don't think we've mentioned, which means no one Justice is putting his or her name on it to say, "I wrote this and... "</p>
                        <p>28:52 Peter: Yeah. The way that they would put per curiam is to say that it's like the opinion of the Court, but the way that I would view it as, is a unsigned... That's how I would view it.</p>
                        <p>29:01 Michael: Yeah. Cowards.</p>
                        <p>29:02 Rhiannon: Exactly. Right. Exactly. And so you automatically start to question why it's per curiam. It's 'cause nobody wants to put their name on it. And then number two, just... The language is facially... It's ridiculous. So there's a quote here, "It is obvious that the recount cannot be conducted in compliance with the requirements of Equal Protection and due process without substantial additional work."</p>
                        <p>29:22 Michael: Okay.</p>
                        <p>29:23 Rhiannon: I literally wrote lol. Like, okay, so work at it then. Figure it the fuck out.</p>
                        <p>29:27 Michael: Yeah. Do the additional work, we're electing the fucking President.</p>
                        <p>29:29 Rhiannon: Right.</p>
                        <p>29:29 Peter: I do have to say I have some sympathy [chuckle] for just being like, "Oof, this is too much." I do this at work all the time [chuckle] where you see there's a big project where people are like, "We have this big important goal." And I'm like, "Oof. Wow. I don't know about this, guys."</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>29:44 Rhiannon: Right. Yes.</p>
                        <p>29:45 Peter: That deadline seems way too soon.</p>
                        <p>29:47 Rhiannon: Yeah. Right. Scalia looked at this and wants a nap. And so it's like, whatever. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>29:51 Michael: The way I saw this framed, the safe harbor thing was like, would you want to submit the actual winner's electors open to challenge versus possibly submitting the actual loser's electors not open to challenge. And the Supreme Court was clearly, it's the loser's electors not open to challenge that Florida wants here. For sure, we're divining the will of Florida's legislature.</p>
                        <p>30:17 Peter: No need to ask the Florida Supreme Court who has already disagreed with us...</p>
                        <p>30:20 Michael: Right. On this very point.</p>
                        <p>30:22 Peter: On this very point. I mean, it's... The whole thing is treating the convenience of the safe harbor provision, which protects the integrity of the state's electors, or some stupid shit that it hasn't mattered in 100 years like that, as more important than the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Now, the reason they're doing this is because they don't actually care about the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. They don't think it's an act of violation of equal protection. They just are, again, just twisting it every way they can to make sure that, A, Bush wins and B, there's no way that it can be changed or reversed or anything, right?</p>
                        <p>31:00 Michael: Right.</p>
                        <p>31:00 Peter: They're saying that they understand Florida law better than the Florida Supreme Court. They're saying all the types of shit like that. And the other thing about this is that they're saying, "By the way, there's no time for a recount, we're out of time." But they just stayed the fucking recount three days before. So they're like, "Alright, first of all, you have to stop." And then three days later, they're like, "Oh, my God, you're out of time."</p>
                        <p>31:21 Rhiannon: Where's the deadline, what the hell?</p>
                        <p>31:23 Peter: Holy shit, guys. Did you guys know that there was... You're out of... I was looking at my watch and then I realize you're out of time as we're writing this, it's crazy. Anyway, good luck. Good luck in the next election, motherfuckers.</p>
                        <p>31:36 Michael: It's just, it's so blatant. It makes me so angry.</p>
                        <p>31:38 Peter: It's one of the... It's incredibly brazen.</p>
                        <p>31:40 Rhiannon: Yeah, I think a big takeaway is that the Supreme Court doesn't have to be doing this at all. In elections, states and localities are setting these standards all the time, they're working through it, Florida has this recount problem, they're setting standards. The Florida Supreme Court is working on it. The legislature's into it. And then the US Supreme Court comes in here and says, "No. Just fucking stop."</p>
                        <p>32:02 Michael: Right, the Florida Supreme Court gave some pretty clear direction based on the Florida constitution that they wanted the votes counted and they said that's what the Florida constitution called for, and this is all state law, the mechanics of their elections, it's very complicated and it's not obvious why the Supreme Court is butting in here.</p>
                        <p>32:22 Peter: Well...</p>
                        <p>32:22 Rhiannon: Well, it's obvious that...</p>
                        <p>32:22 Peter: It is obvious, yes.</p>
                        <p>32:22 Rhiannon: It's political, right?</p>
                        <p>32:24 Peter: It's not obvious what the actual reason would be if you were to formulate a real one.</p>
                        <p>32:28 Michael: It's not legally obvious but politically, it's painfully obvious.</p>
                        <p>32:32 Rhiannon: And the petition from Bush's lawyers, that comes first to Justice Kennedy, right? He's the one that brings it to conference?</p>
                        <p>32:40 Peter: That sounds like a section of the Wikipedia that you read that I didn't. Let it rip, Rhi.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>32:42 Michael: Shit, go for it.</p>
                        <p>32:46 Rhiannon: Kennedy is the one who brings it to conference, Justices like Antonin Scalia think, yes, the Supreme Court has to step in here, and Justices like Stevens...</p>
                        <p>32:57 Peter: Oh, my God, he wants to so bad. Imagine Scalia, when it first became clear that they had the option of intervening, the fucking sheer joy that must have overwhelmed him.</p>
                        <p>33:08 Rhiannon: Raging boner for this case.</p>
                        <p>33:10 Michael: Raging three inch erection. [laughter] And here's the thing is that even if you try to be generous to these guys and be like, well, look, maybe they're just going on their intuitions, it's totally backwards. All the Justices who wanna weigh in here and overrule the Florida courts, generally, their intuitions are that the federal court should stay out of state business. Right? That's their...</p>
                        <p>33:33 Peter: That's the other thing, is like the conservatives on the Court constantly, like when the federal government's trying to expand minority rights or something, the conservatives will step in and be like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh. State issue, sorry, we would love to, but this is actually all the states. Sorry, you can't fuck around with this at all, 'cause you're the feds." And then here all of a sudden, they have zero respect.</p>
                        <p>33:51 Michael: "I'm sympathetic to your argument that Black people are full people, but you know, I really just don't..."</p>
                        <p>33:57 Peter: "Unfortunately, South Carolina is not."</p>
                        <p>34:00 Michael: Right, and I don't think it's our place. I don't think so, but here we have very strong opinions on whether or not a dimpled ballot versus a half-hanging chad ballot should be counted. And so I wanna say, we're sitting here and we're sort of divining ill intent from the strained reasoning here, and I don't think that's hard. I don't think it's a stretch, I think it's blatantly obvious. But I also wanna say, I know someone who clerked on the Supreme Court and at the end of...</p>
                        <p>34:31 Peter: La-di-da, Michael, la-di-da.</p>
                        <p>34:33 Rhiannon: Oh, look who has friends in high places.</p>
                        <p>34:36 Peter: I actually, I've got a friend who is an AVP at Goldman.</p>
                        <p>34:40 Michael: Wow. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>34:40 Peter: I don't really, I don't. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>34:43 Rhiannon: I have a friend on death row.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>34:48 Michael: We all have friends.</p>
                        <p>34:48 Peter: Why do you have to drag us down, Rhi?</p>
                        <p>34:51 Michael: Good for us. So my friend told me that they spent some time looking at old memos, sort of digging through the archives to see what people were saying in private about this, and there were two Justices who were just not even hiding in their personal memos and in their inter-office communications that all they were trying to do here was affirm that Bush won and they didn't care about the legal reasoning and how they got there. And they're protected in this because there's a very strong sort of cone of silence around what happens in the Supreme Court among the clerks. And so this is being told to me in confidence by someone who could clearly right this and it would be maybe the most important and impactful thing they could do in their career, would be to publish copies of these memos and sort of shine a light on this.</p>
                        <p>35:49 Peter: Yeah, but I'm sure that they're doing great at the Brennan Center.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>35:53 Michael: Not at the Brennan Center.</p>
                        <p>35:55 Rhiannon: I think it's a really important point, Michael, that the secrecy and the...</p>
                        <p>35:58 Peter: That was a joke.</p>
                        <p>36:00 Rhiannon: The secrecy and the ivory tower bullshit, that's not because it makes the law better, right? It's because it serves powerful people and their interests and keeping their jobs and excelling and making money.</p>
                        <p>36:12 Michael: Right, and so that's why you need to hear from three dirt bags on a podcast that the Supreme Court's all bullshit is because the people who practice before the Supreme Court and the people who clerk for the Supreme Court, and the people who spend their life writing law review articles about all the implications of the writings of the Supreme Court, all benefit from its perceived legitimacy.</p>
                        <p>36:34 Peter: Yeah, they're tied up in it.</p>
                        <p>36:36 Rhiannon: But the last main paragraph of this opinion is so fucking offensive because it is that lie, it is that public image that they want about what the Court does, so, "None are more conscious of the vital limits on judicial authority than are the members of this Court, and none stand more in admiration of the Constitution's design to leave this election of the President to the people, through their legislatures and to the political sphere." Fuck you, guys, like you just...</p>
                        <p>37:03 Peter: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>37:04 Michael: Eat shit.</p>
                        <p>37:05 [Archival]: Today, the top Gore lawyer says the legal battle is over.</p>
                        <p>37:08 [Archival]: We've had an appeal, we've taken that appeal. There is no appeal from the United States Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>37:13 Peter: Let's try to envision what would have happened if the Supreme Court doesn't shut down the recount, right.</p>
                        <p>37:19 Michael: Right. It's hard to game out because there are so many different scenarios, right? Is there the full statewide manual recount? Is something more modest settled on, just undervotes and overvotes counted, is it just certain counties, do they go revert back to that? I mean, what if the Supreme Court never intervened in the first place because they had cast doubt on the Florida Supreme Court a month earlier in a separate decision, and that sort of sent things in a weird direction. But there are scenarios where a limited recount gives the election to Gore, or a full recount maybe affirms that Bush won on a very narrow vote. But again, if this all happens after the safe harbor, maybe Congress questions it, maybe the Florida legislature goes through with their plan of affirming Bush as the winner regardless of the vote, and that's it. It's hard...</p>
                        <p>38:16 Peter: But that's... This discrepancy is what's important, right? The... You have uncertainty on one hand and certainty on the other. You have the certainty of Bush winning if you halt the recount and you have uncertainty on the other hand, and there are like a dozen procedural things that could have happened if the recount continued, there could have been more court cases, different court cases, more narrow court cases. But the bottom line is that there would have been some risk of Gore winning. And they couldn't tolerate it, they couldn't tolerate it.</p>
                        <p>38:47 Peter: So I think the part of the takeaway here is that Bush v. Gore was not when the Supreme Court became political, the Court has always been driven by ideology, politics and power, but Bush v. Gore exposed just how shallow and partisan the Court's politics actually are, and stripped away the veneer of impartiality and high-mindedness that the Court sort of hides behind. And anyone who thinks after Bush v. Gore that the Court functions as an independent body separate from politics, or that it even could function like that theoretically is just a rube, just a complete fucking sucker. We should talk about the alternate world we would all live in if Gore won.</p>
                        <p>39:30 Rhiannon: Can you fucking imagine?</p>
                        <p>39:32 Peter: There's been tons of research into what would have happened if you imagine a fair election, and it's extremely hard to say, because there was so much bullshit going on.</p>
                        <p>39:42 Michael: You can hold everything else constant, and if the ballots in Palm Beach County are designed different, Al Gore wins, right?</p>
                        <p>39:48 Peter: Yes.</p>
                        <p>39:48 Michael: That's just without controversy at this point.</p>
                        <p>39:50 Peter: Right, and the question is, you know what, how different is the world we live in, obviously, we're 20 years out, it's hard to say, but the one really significant thing is that Al Gore was the first presidential candidate, I think, to ever really significantly talk about global warming, which at the time was like a punch line, just like, "Oh, my God, this fuck. He's obsessed with this." The world's like, "What are you talking about, Al? You fucking nerd, you boring nerd. Let's see what the idiot has to say about this." So do I think he could have passed significant global warming legislation, what would have been necessary at the time? No, no, probably not, but it would have been on the political radar 15 years at least before it was. The other thing is that Bush gets elected, and then within a year plans and orchestrates the 9/11 attack.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>40:49 Peter: Alright, so we wanna end this episode on a little more of a positive note, and I think a good way to do it is the five majority Justices in this case were Rehnquist, Scalia, Thomas, O'Connor, and...</p>
                        <p>41:09 Michael: Kennedy.</p>
                        <p>41:09 Peter: And Kennedy. And of those Rehnquist and Scalia are dead.</p>
                        <p>41:15 Michael: That's right.</p>
                        <p>41:15 Rhiannon: Allahu Akbar.</p>
                        <p>41:16 Michael: The two that I said may have been...</p>
                        <p>41:18 Peter: The two worst.</p>
                        <p>41:19 Michael: The two... Arguably.</p>
                        <p>41:20 Peter: I think that the two overall worst in terms of, if you just had to measure out who's a worst human being, they're the two worst.</p>
                        <p>41:26 Michael: Right, they are.</p>
                        <p>41:26 Peter: You can make the argument that Kennedy has been more damaging, because he's got this wishy-washy bullshit vibe about him, but I think in reality, if we're all being honest.</p>
                        <p>41:37 Michael: These two guys have had an almost immeasurable harm that they've inflicted on the country in their lives.</p>
                        <p>41:42 Rhiannon: Yeah, talk about irreparable harm.</p>
                        <p>41:44 Peter: Two of the greatest...</p>
                        <p>41:45 Michael: Yeah, that's right, that's right.</p>
                        <p>41:46 Peter: Cut that. [laughter] No, it's true, though. If you talk about modern era Supreme Court, after everyone agreed that minorities are human beings, these two guys are the worst, right?</p>
                        <p>42:02 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>42:03 Rhiannon: Yup.</p>
                        <p>42:03 Peter: There's no question.</p>
                        <p>42:04 Michael: And Rehnquist...</p>
                        <p>42:05 Rhiannon: Also, I don't think they believe that.</p>
                        <p>[chuckle]</p>
                        <p>42:06 Michael: Right. Rehnquist, in particular, is like a relic of before that era, right? He was famously a segregationist who was not on board with Brown v. Board when he was a clerk at the Supreme Court level.</p>
                        <p>42:19 Peter: Ugh, Rehnquist, he's an all-time piece of shit.</p>
                        <p>42:21 Michael: Yes.</p>
                        <p>42:21 Peter: But he's dead.</p>
                        <p>42:23 Michael: Yes. [chuckle]</p>
                        <p>42:23 Peter: And I can't emphasize it enough, cannot hit that point, we're gonna circle back a few times over the course of the next several episodes, about how dead William Rehnquist is.</p>
                        <p>[laughter]</p>
                        <p>42:36 Michael: And finally, 20 years too late, the Democrats are talking about Supreme Court reform, so who knows, maybe 20 years from now, we'll actually have something resembling sanity with this, who knows.</p>
                        <p>42:47 Peter: Yeah, I think there is a chance. I think it isn't...</p>
                        <p>42:51 Michael: Rhiannon's looking at me. She's like no.</p>
                        <p>42:52 Rhiannon: Yeah, just don't have any hope.</p>
                        <p>42:53 Peter: Well, it's an... No, it's an outside shot, it's an outside shot, for sure, but there's...</p>
                        <p>42:56 Michael: I'm not bullish on it, but I'm just saying.</p>
                        <p>42:58 Peter: I think that the Kavanaugh experience was sort of an awakening for Democrats in some regard, whether or not they actually do anything as a result is a completely different thing, but I think several... A lot of prominent moderate establishment Democrats were able to look at that and think like, this is sort of naked power play. And the only question is whether they are able to eventually reckon with the idea that the proper response is naked power play, and not trying to play semantic games or whatever and nominate Merrick Garland.</p>
                        <p>43:36 Peter: Alright, the next episode is gonna be, I think, a bit of a banger, it's Citizens United v. FEC, and maybe I think maybe the most symbolically important case over the past decade or so. And something that has sort of become the embodiment of corruption and the distinct level of inequality that we see in this modern political era.</p>
                        <p>44:03 Rhiannon: Yeah, plenty of stuff to get really pissed off about in that opinion.</p>
                        <p>44:06 Michael: [chuckle] Yeah.</p>
                        <p>44:07 Peter: It's a terrible case, also one of those cases that law students are told is actually quite reasonable, but then when you read it like, no, dude, it's terrible.</p>
                        <p>44:14 Michael: No way, this is...</p>
                        <p>44:15 Peter: It's so fucking bad, it's so fucking bad.</p>
                        <p>44:17 Michael: It's really bad. I'm looking forward to taking a big shit on it.</p>
                        <p>44:25 Peter: Yeah.</p>
