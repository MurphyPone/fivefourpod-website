31,"SEP 15, 2020","LA v. Lyons","On this week’s episode of 5-4, Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael are talking about police use of chokeholds. In 1983, the Supreme Court held in City of Los Angeles v.

35,"OCT 13, 2020","The Electoral College Coup is Coming","The hosts discuss the past, present, and future of the Electoral College, and all the ways it could be used to stage a procedural coup in the upcoming election. They also talk about how the Electoral College could be restructured to give greater representation to states with large populations, like California. But if it were up to them, they’d get rid of this undemocratic institution all together, and switch to a system in which the president is chosen by popular vote.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have weakened America's immune system, like a lifetime of poor nutrition"
36,"OCT 20, 2020","Rucho v. Common Cause","The hosts reflect on the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings, then move on to discussing gerrymandering, the practice of drawing up voting districts to favor a particular political party. Specifically, they talk about Rucho v. Common Cause, a 2019 case in which the Supreme Court not only refused to rule on two states’ gerrymandered maps, they found all partisan gerrymandering to be outside the purview of the Court going forward.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have sapped oxygen from America's bloodstream like the novel virus COVID-19"
37,"OCT 27, 2020","How to Fix the Court feat. Rep Ro Khanna","The hosts discuss options for reforming the court — from court packing, to term limits for judges, to stripping the court of jurisdiction to hear cases pertaining to new laws. They also speak to Congressman Ro Khanna about court reform, and about the bill he has introduced to limit Supreme Court Justices' tenure. But they remain clear on their preferred option: packing the court to include more liberal justices.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have taken control of American life, like that fungus that takes control of ants' brains and turns them into zombies"
38,"NOV 10, 2020","The Courts Can't Save Him","The hosts look back at the week-long presidential election, which Joe Biden won. They discuss the challenges mounted by the Trump campaign in various states and explain why none of them is likely to change the outcome of the election. They also reflect on some state-level initiatives and put forth their strategy for how President Biden should deal with a split Senate, especially on matters pertaining to the Supreme Court.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have left America flailing and helpless, like an outgoing president who is emotionally incapable of admitting defeat"
39,"NOV 17, 2020","Arizona Free Enterprise v. Bennett","The hosts return to examining cases with a little-known campaign finance decision from 2011: Arizona Free Enterprise Club PAC v. Bennett. They discuss the Supreme Court’s ruling, which declared unconstitutional a matching funds program for political candidates who opt out of private fundraising, effectively killing public campaign financing. The hosts also talk about the Trump campaign’s ongoing efforts -- in the courts and otherwise -- to contest the results of the 2020 election, and how likely they are to affect the Biden victory.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have infiltrated American life, like an invasive species"
40,"DEC 1, 2020","Ashcroft v. Iqbal","The hosts discuss Ashcroft v. Iqbal, a 2008 case in which the Court created a new pleading standard for legal complaints that made it much harder for plaintiffs to bring their cases. Here, a Pakistani immigrant who claimed he was detained and tortured in the wake of 9/11 had his case dismissed because, according to the Court, his allegations that Bush administration officials were responsible for his treatment were not “plausible.”","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have blocked out America's sun, like a California brushfire"
41,"DEC 8, 2020","Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo","The hosts discuss Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, a recent case about COVID-19-related restrictions on religious gatherings. In it, the Supreme Court struck down hard capacity caps on religious gatherings in high-risk areas. The case has already spawned more challenges to pandemic-related restrictions on religious gatherings and likely foreshadows the expansion of legal exemptions for religious groups.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have coalesced like that garbage island in the Pacific Ocean; together a monument to the sheer scale of man's folley"
42,"DEC 15, 2020","Herrera v. Collins","The hosts take on a 1993 death penalty case that has been called one of the worst decisions in capital punishment jurisprudence. Herrera v. Collins asks whether someone on death row can have new evidence of their innocence reviewed in federal habeas corpus proceedings, often the last resort for someone who has exhausted their appeals. In a 6-to-3 vote, the Court rejected the claim, barely shying away from holding that the Constitution does not protect against an innocent person being executed.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have killed off our civil liberties in the service of a misguided intellectual experiment, like Edison killed Topsy the elephant"
43,"DEC 29, 2020","5-4 x Know Your Enemy","Peter, Rhiannon, and Michael join the hosts of the podcast Know Your Enemy for a conversation about the conservative legal movement. They discuss the origins of conservative doctrines like originalism and textualism, and the rise of the Federalist Society from a small group of conservative students and academics to an organization whose members constitute the majority of the Supreme Court.","Last week, we guested Know Your Enemy. An extremely good podcast about the Conservative movement to discuss the Conservative legal movement"
44,"JAN 12, 2021","The Rise and Fall of Roe v. Wade, Pt. 1","The hosts take on one of the Supreme Court’s most famous decisions, Roe v. Wade. In this first episode of a two-part series, they look at the legal and factual origins of Roe v. Wade. They also discuss how Roe was weaponized by the conservative legal movement to rally against an interpretation of the Constitution that allows for flexibility in favor of a far more rigid approach.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have caused our civil liberties to disappear, like Amelia Earhart over the Pacific"
45,"JAN 19, 2021","The Rise and Fall of Roe v. Wade, Pt. 2","In the second part of a two-episode series on abortion rights, the hosts discuss Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 case in which the Supreme Court made it easier for states to restrict abortion access so long as abortion regulations don’t create an “undue burden.” The vague standard set lawmakers on a new path of attacking abortion access and fueled anti-abortion groups’ efforts to spread stigma and misinformation, setting up Roe v. Wade for a death by a thousand cuts.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have dissolved our liberties, like cotton candy into water."
46,"JAN 26, 2021","Morse v. Frederick","In 2002, a student held up a banner that said “Bong Hits 4 Jesus” at an Olympic torch relay, in full view of his classmates and teachers. When he was suspended, he claimed his banner was protected free speech under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court disagreed. In this episode, your hosts discuss the contours of student free speech, the Court’s puritanical moralizing on marijuana, and the importance of absurdist speech in creating real change.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have, like a mighty river, wound their way over the great rock of our liberty, reducing it over many years to a canyon of despair"
47,"FEB 2, 2021","Navarette v. California","Your hosts discuss Navarette v. California, which held that an unverified anonymous tip about reckless driving could be sufficient grounds for the police to pull over a car. The case exemplifies how deferential the Supreme Court is to police power, and has resulted in an increased reliance on anonymous tips by the cops, and a corresponding erosion of citizens’ privacy rights.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have driven our liberties to the outer edges of their habitats, like the American settlers did to the Grey Wolf"
48,"FEB 9, 2021","US v. Morrison","The hosts discuss a case in which the Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that allowed women to sue abusers in federal court for damages. In the process, the Court constrained the ability of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, not only weakening an important civil rights law, but also making it more difficult for Congress to pass progressive legislation going forward.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have caused our freedoms to fade away, like the colors of a painting in the sunlight"
49,"FEB 16, 2021","Atkins v. Virginia","The hosts discuss Atkins v. Virginia, a case in which the Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on people with intellectual disabilities. But the Court also created a loophole by allowing states to decide the standard for who qualifies as intellectually disabled. As a result of the Court’s lack of clarity, some states have continued to execute people with intellectual disabilities to this day.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have pecked away at our civil rights, like a nervous bird plucking at its feathers"
50,"FEB 23, 2021","McCleskey v. Kemp ft. Josie Duffy Rice","The hosts are joined by Josie Duffy Rice of The Appeal to discuss another death penalty case — McCleskey v. Kemp. In this 1987 decision, the Supreme Court held that statistical evidence of systemic racial disparities is not enough to prove discrimination. Instead, defendants have to show that individual prosecutors, judges or juries pursued them with racist intent. As a result, states were basically let off the hook for perpetuating systemic racism in death penalty cases.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have bulldozed our civil rights, like the Cargill corporation has bulldozed the Amazon Rainforest",
51,"MAR 9, 2021","San Antonio ISD v. Rodriguez ft. Alec Karakatsanis","The hosts are joined by Alec Karakatsanis (@equalityAlec), founder and executive director of Civil Rights Corps, and the author of Usual Cruelty: The Complicity of Lawyers in the Criminal Injustice System. They discuss San Antonio ISD v Rodriguez, an equal protection case from 1973, which is widely cited by conservatives as holding that the equal protection clause does not protect impoverished people. The hosts beg to differ.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have dilapidated our liberty, like rising ocean temperatures have bleached the Great Barrier Reef"

55,"APR 13, 2021","Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board","The hosts discuss Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), a 5-4 decision in which the Supreme Court denied a worker back pay that he was owed after being unlawfully terminated for union organizing, citing his lack of authorization to work in the United States. The decision completely rejected the ruling of the NLRB, guidance from the Department of Justice, standing immigration law, and basic human decency.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have rendered our liberties completely immobile, like a cargo ship turned sideways in the Suez Canal"
56,"APR 27, 2021","Bowles v. Russell","The hosts are joined by Josie Duffy Rice and Jay Willis of The Appeal, to discuss 'Worst Supreme Court Justice of All Time' bracketology, and simple arithmetic. This week's case is Bowles v. Russell, in which the petitioner sought to have his appeal heard because a judge had miscalculated a deadline, and his lawyer had the audacity to adhere to it. The court denied the petitioner, citing 'rules are rules, even when they aren't actually rules.'","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have devastated American civil liberties, like domesticated cats have devastated local bird populations"

59,"MAY 25, 2021","Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

69,"SEPTEMBER 3, 2021","SB8: Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson","In this emergency episode, the hosts discuss Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, the case where the Supreme Court declined to stay SB8. SB8 is the monstrous Texas law that allows anyone to sue anyone who even intends to help someone get an abortion after 6 weeks of pregnancy. The effect is that while very early term abortions are still legal in Texas, private individuals have been deputized to bounty hunt abortion providers, activists, and even Uber drivers.","This is a tough way to start the day..."
70,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2021","Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl","A treaty or law not honored by the United States? It's more likely than you think! In a rare child custody case, the Supreme Court rules on the Indian Child Welfare Act, and finds that when you squint your eyes and look at the law kinda sideways in the dark, Congress must not have meant for the law to actually keep Native families together. Land back.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have caused our civil rights to fade out of view, like a dying star in the night sky"
71,"OCTOBER 5, 2021","Nieves v. Bartlett","This case originates out of an incident at opposite Burning Man, a ski race in Alaska called Arctic Man.

74,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021","Hamdi v. Rumsfeld","A foreign 'prisoner of war' can communicate with their family. An American 'traitor' can argue their case in court. An American 'enemy combatant' can do neither, according to the Supreme Court, creating a third category of prisoner with very few legal rights. America immediately post-9/11 was very chill and normal.","A podcast where we dissect and analyze the Supreme Court cases that have caused America's lofty promise to fall like a dying satellite slowly crashing back to earth"

If you can't count it, it doesn't count, according to the majority in this 5-4 ruling, which turned back EPA rules on mercury emissions from power plants.

77,"DECEMBER 7, 2021","Town of Greece v. Galloway","Let us now bow our heads in observance of this episode about why the Supreme Court thinks it's OK for a government to have prayer before public meetings, but NOT OK for the town to manage who gives that prayer or what they pray about.

79,"JANUARY 18, 2022","Florida v. Riley","Go-go-gadget surveillance state! In this case the Court holds that cops can hover a helicopter over your house and peer into it without a warrant.

80,"JANUARY 25, 2022","NFIB v. Department of Labor","In this ongoing case, the Court holds that requirements that employees mask and test weekly, or get vaccinated, cannot be enforced while a challenge makes its way through the judiciary.

82,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022","Ingraham v. Wright","This episode contains references to physical abuse of children. Take care when listening.  The standing law on corporal punishment - physically punishing children - in schools, is that it's legal because 8th Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment only applies to CRIMES.

83,"MARCH 1, 2022","Merrill v. Milligan","The Supreme Court says there's simply no time before elections that are months away, to redraw racist Congressional district maps, that took all of one week to make initially.

United States","This unanimous decision holds that cops who don't deal with traffic enforcement are allowed to tail you until you commit a minor offense, and then literally dive head first into your car to nab you on an unrelated drug charge.

93,"JUNE 7, 2022","Federal Election Commission v. Ted Cruz for Senate","This week, the hosts use a variety of film and television references to try and capture the pure villainy of a recent ruling that allows candidates to ""loan"" their campaigns unlimited money and be paid back, with donor funds, AFTER they're elected.

Boule","In this case the Court holds that you have no right to sue a federal official, even if a border agent trespasses on your property, knocks you to the ground, and calls the IRS on you for having the gall to file a complaint about it.

95,"JUNE 25, 2022","Emergency Episode: Roe Is Overturned","The Supreme Court has released the long-awaited Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. The news is bad. Ruling in favor of Mississippi, the Court allows the state to ban nearly all abortions after 15 weeks. The opinion is written by Justice Samuel Alito, and is largely the same as the opinion that was leaked earlier this year. Alito writes, ""The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives."" Roe v. Wade, precedent that has guaranteed privacy and bodily autonomy for half a century, is dead, imperiling the access to reproductive healthcare for millions of people.

97,"JULY 12, 2022","Kennedy v. Bremerton School District","In this case from the most recent term, the Court once again says we should look to history and tradition to determine what's appropriate.
