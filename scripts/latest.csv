Kemp. In this 1987 decision, the Supreme Court held that statistical evidence of systemic racial disparities is not enough to prove discrimination. Instead, defendants have to show that individual prosecutors, judges or juries pursued them with racist intent. As a result, states were basically let off the hook for perpetuating systemic racism in death penalty cases.",https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mccleskey-v-kemp-ft-josie-duffy-rice/id1497785843?i=1000510297613,apple,apple,apple

Virginia, a case in which the Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on people with intellectual disabilities.

As a result of the Court’s lack of clarity, some states have continued to execute people with intellectual disabilities to this day.",https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/atkins-v-virginia/id1497785843?i=1000509223321,apple,apple,apple

California, which held that an unverified anonymous tip about reckless driving could be sufficient grounds for the police to pull over a car. The case exemplifies how deferential the Supreme Court is to police power, and has resulted in an increased reliance on anonymous tips by the cops, and a corresponding erosion of citizens’ privacy rights.",https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/navarette-v-california/id1497785843?i=1000507415990,apple,apple,apple

Casey, a 1992 case in which the Supreme Court made it easier for states to restrict abortion access so long as abortion regulations don’t create an “undue burden.” The vague standard set lawmakers on a new path of attacking abortion access and fueled anti-abortion groups’ efforts to spread stigma and misinformation, setting up Roe v.

Herrera v. Collins asks whether someone on death row can have new evidence of their innocence reviewed in federal habeas corpus proceedings, often the last resort for someone who has exhausted their appeals. In a 6-to-3 vote, the Court rejected the claim, barely shying away from holding that the Constitution does not protect against an innocent person being executed.",https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/5-4-x-know-your-enemy/id1497785843?i=1000503768997,apple,apple,apple
