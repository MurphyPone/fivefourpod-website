Casey, a 1992 case in which the Supreme Court made it easier for states to restrict abortion access so long as abortion regulations don’t create an “undue burden.” The vague standard set lawmakers on a new path of attacking abortion access and fueled anti-abortion groups’ efforts to spread stigma and misinformation, setting up Roe v. Wade for a death by a thousand cuts.",https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rise-and-fall-of-roe-v-wade-pt-2/id1497785843?i=1000505768212,apple,apple,apple

Collins","On this week’s episode of 5-4, Peter (@The_Law_Boy), Rhiannon (@AywaRhiannon), and Michael (@_FleerUltra) take on a 1993 death penalty case that has been called one of the worst decisions in capital punishment jurisprudence.

Iqbal, a 2008 case in which the Court created a new pleading standard for legal complaints that made it much harder for plaintiffs to bring their cases.
